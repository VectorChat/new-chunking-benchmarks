categories at 60.8% and 26.3% respectively.\nDespite their poor performance shooting from beyond the 3-point line, Duquesne still shot the fourth most three-pointers of all teams in the Atlantic 10.\nThe following chart displays player per-game average statistics for the regular season and Atlantic 10 tournament.", "The Dukes played their first game of the season on November 7 in an exhibition match against Division III La Roche.\nDuquesne scored a 47-point victory in which Damian Saunders led in scoring with 17 points.\nDespite the solid win, Duquesne made only 47.6 % from the free throw line, a trend which haunted the team the rest of the season.\nThe regular season home-opener was another victory for the team, as they defeated Nicholls State 85-62 on November 13.\nEarly in the game, Melquan Bolding hit the floor on a hard foul during a breakaway.\nAfter a few minutes, he recovered and went on to lead the team with 25 points.\nSaunders scored 17 points with 19

were unable to turn the momentum and continued to fall behind, eventually losing 51 \u2013 65.\nThe absence of Bill Clark showed on defense, as the Dukes were out-rebounded heavily.\nThe Dukes also failed to improve on their issues from the regular season, going only 8 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 15 from 3-point range.\nThis loss ended the 2009 season, and all Duquesne could do was look ahead to the next year.", "Duquesne players received a few accolades in the 2009 \u2013 10 season.\nJunior Damian Saunders's outstanding play earned him a spot on the Atlantic 10 All-Conference

with Richmond's Kevin Anderson.", "=== Early conference play === Duquesne opened conference play on January 6 in a match against the Richmond Spiders, a team which the Dukes had not defeated since the

where they again lost with a final score of 67 \u2013 75, dropping their conference record to 0 \u2013 4.\nBill Clark missed a game for the first time in his college career due to a suspension on

2.9, a nation-leading figure.\nWith this, Saunders had at one point led the nation in double-doubles, rebounds, and steals.\nThe Dukes lost again, 80 \u2013 92, in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure.\nThe loss put a damper on Duquesne's hopes for a home game in the first round of the Atlantic 10 tournament, as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position.\nDuquesne closed its season against Fordham, who had yet to win a conference game and had only won two games all season.\nFordham was hungry for a win, and a lack of effective defense on both sides led to a high scoring 111 \u2013 100 victory for Duquesne.\nMelquan Bolding and Eric Evans both posted career high scores of 32 and 23, respectively.", "The 2009-10 Duquesne Dukes men's basketball team represented Duquesne

new year with five straight victories.\nSoon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury and the other to suspension.\nDuquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak.\nThe team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum.\nIn mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21 point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd.", "Duquesne lost only one starter, Aaron Jackson, from the 2008-09 team which ended with a record of 21-13, the first time since 1981 that the school had 20 or more wins in a season.\nPicked to finish 12th in the Atlantic 10, Duquesne went on to finish second, losing to Temple by only five points in the conference championship game.\nThis earned Duquesne a bid into the National Invitation Tournament, its first postseason appearance since 1994.\nThe team was eliminated in a double-overtime first round loss to Virginia Tech, but the Dukes' unlikely success inspired the hope of a return to the NIT, or perhaps even the NCAA tournament.\nOn May 12, 2009 the school announced that two freshman forwards, Shawntez Patterson and Aleksandar Milovic, had been released from their scholarships and cleared to transfer to other schools.\nBoth saw limited action in the 2008 season.", "The men's basketball Dukes

Dayton === Duquesne enjoyed another game at home on February 14 against the La Salle Explorers.\nRon Everhart sought a new strategy for his team, which was struggling in conference play.\nIn this game, La Salle was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players.\nDuquesne ran a 10-40 pattern, in which two squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad.\nAt first, Duquesne fell behind by 14 points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired.\nWith La Salle fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation and went on to win 103 \u2013 82.\nBill Clark scored a career high 34 points, and also surpassed the 1,000 point mark.\nAs underdogs on the road against the Charlotte 49ers, the Dukes' new 10-40 strategy led them to an 83 \u2013 77 upset victory.\nThis was the first time of the season the team had managed to win two consecutive conference games.\nOn February 21, Duquesne again

their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose.\nBoth teams lost, so the tie remained and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records.\nThus Duquesne would head back out on the road against the Bonnies.\nThe game was played on March 9 and was close until the Bonnies went on a 14 \u2013 0 run halfway into the second half, going on to win 71 \u2013 83.\nDespite Damian Saunders posting his 20th and final double-double of the year, Duquesne's 5 for 21 performance from beyond the 3-point arc combined with St. Bonaventure's 75% 3-point shooting and two players scoring in the upper twenties put the game out of the Dukes' reach.\nThe loss dashed Duquesne's last hopes at a bid to the NIT.\nHowever, an invitation to either the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) or CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament was still possible.", "=== First conference win, Xavier, and Saint Joseph's === Two days later, Clark was reinstated.\nWith Clark back in the lineup for a home game against St. Bonaventure Bonnies, Ron Everhart tried a new starting lineup: one that included Bolding and Monteiro, but left Senior Jason Duty on the bench.\nThe Dukes took a 15 point lead at half time, but the Bonnies came back.\nWith less than thirty seconds left, Bill Clark drew a charging penalty which gave his team the ball, down by two.\nOne quick possession by each team left it 67 \u2013 69 in favor of the Bonnies.\nOn the final play, Damian Saunders drove towards the basket before passing it out to Melquan Bolding, who hit a 3-point shot to put the Dukes up by one with 3.5 seconds remaining.\nDuquesne won 70 \u2013 69, giving them their first win since December 22.\nThe winning feeling was short-lived, however, as the Dukes were shut down by the Xavier Musketeers on January 28,

Colonials in Washington, D.C..

fouling out in the final minutes.\nOn December 5, Duquesne hosted the Chuck Cooper Classic, in which it defeated the Savannah State Tigers by a score of 58 \u2013 44.\nEric Evans led with 17 points and Damian Saunders contributed 15.", "The season was also marred by a few controversies.\nPrior to the beginning of play, B.J.\nMonteiro was arrested on October 3 in Middletown, Connecticut.\nHe turned himself into police on suspicion of participating in the theft of a laptop, iPod, and cash from a house during a party in early August.\nHe was charged with third-degree larceny and, on October 6, he was suspended indefinitely from the team.\nFollowing his court appearance on October 13, all charges were dropped and Monteiro was reinstated to the team.\nIn late January, Junior Bill Clark was benched for the game against Rhode Island as the NCAA investigated a potential secondary rules violation.\nThe specific details of the incident were not released by Duquesne, even after Clark's return to the team the next day.\nA secondary rules violation is defined as \u201cone that is isolated or inadvertent in nature, provides or is intended to provide only a minimal recruiting, competitive or other advantage.\u201d In the postseason, Bill Clark was again suspended, this time by coach Everhart for a conduct issue.\nThe day before the CBI game against Princeton, Everhart announced that Clark

before a short Christmas break, Duquesne defeated the Saint Francis Red Flash 86 \u2013 56.\nDamian Saunders scored his tenth double-double, making him the national leader in that statistic, as well

still managed to post his eleventh double-double, coming just one block short of what would have been only the second triple-double in school history.", "=== Postseason === After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies also lost their final regular season game to Xavier, which left the two teams in a tie for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it.\nThe two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory.\nDuquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island.\nUnfortunately, those two teams were also in a tie.", "=== West Virginia, Robert Morris, and Canisius === Four days later, the Dukes were blown out 39 \u2013 68 by #7 West Virginia.\nSaunders led the team with only 12 points.\nOne analyst attributed this loss to the skill of the Mountaineers, an abysmal night by star Bill Clark, as well as the continued absence of Melquan Bolding and now senior captain Jason Duty, who missed the game with a sprained ankle.\nOn December 12 the Dukes faced off against another local rival, Robert Morris.\nIn a 59 \u2013 54 win, B.J.\nMonteiro again led the team with 17 points.\nMonteiro's continued high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, to wonder whether the approaching return of
