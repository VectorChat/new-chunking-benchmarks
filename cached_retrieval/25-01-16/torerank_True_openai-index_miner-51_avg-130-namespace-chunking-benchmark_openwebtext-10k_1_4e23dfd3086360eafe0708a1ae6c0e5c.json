3-betting/5-betting in position after a ~15% EP raise from Alice?\n3.2 Bob's optimal 3-bet-strategy versus Alice's optimal raising strategy in EP We're assuming Bob knows Alice's opening range (he only needs to know the % of hands, not the specific hands), either from observation, or by using a HUD.\nAlice's raise percentage dictates her value 4-bet range, which dictates Bob's strategies for 3-betting and 5-betting.\nBob starts by finding the hands that he 3-bets and 5-bets all-in, purely for value.", "From the previous theory section, we remember that Bob wants to have enough Axs 5-bet bluffs in his value range to make Alice's weakest value hands break even.\nThis accomplishes two things for Bob: He forces Alice to fold more of her 4-bet bluffs He makes it impossible for Alice to \"cheat\" by not paying off Bob's value 5-bets with {KK+}.\nIf she tries to be \"smart\" and fold QQ/AK, Bob will just collect his profit with his 5-bet bluffs instead.\nSo Bob's 5-bet bluffs with some Axs hands attack Alice's 4-bet bluffs, and they also make it impossible for her to profitably tighten up her value range, even if she knows Bob's value range is the squeaky tight {KK+}.", "The strategy pairs depend on the raiser's opening range, but the ~15% and ~25% EP and CO ranges are relatively standard, and you will meet many opponents who play close to these ranges.\nIf you need to apply the theory to other ranges, just plug them into the method, and construct the strategy pairs yourself.\nWe didn't look at small blind vs big blind in this article, even if it falls under the same category with the raiser out of position.\nI elected to leave this situation out, since blind vs blind dynamics is very dependent on the players involved, and the history between them.\nSo it's difficult (and probably not very useful) to try and generalize and assign SB a standard opening range.", "Let's see what Bob's optimal total 3-bet% is in this case: Value part: 20 combos (1.5% of all hands) Bluff part: Effectively 20% of 152 =30 combos (2.3% of all hands) This results in a total 3-bet% of 1.5 + 2.3 =3.8% against Alice's ~15% EP raises.\nHis value/bluff ratio is the desired optimal 20/30 =40/60.\nLater, when we construct an optimal strategy against Alice's 25% CO range, we'll see that Bob's 3-bet% skyrockets as a consequence of Alice raising a much wider opening range.", "No matter what her opening range is, she can always use this percentage to obtain a 60/40 value bluff ratio for her 4-bets.\nLet's double-check to see that this works the way it should: When Alice has raised some opening range and gotten 3-bet, we have deduced that her optimal value 4-bet range is 18% of her total range.\nIf she 4-bets the remaining 82% of her range as a bluff 15% of the time, her overall bluff percentage will be 0.15 x 0.82 =0.12 =12%.\nSo her total 4-bet range is he optimal 18 + 12 =30%, with a 18/12 =60/40 value/bluff ration.\nSo the percentages add up perfectly.\nAlice's optimal raise/4-bet/call 5-bet strategy in EP We now have everything we need to specify Alice's total strategy after a 15% open-raise.", "This makes sense if you think about it.\nWhen we're making a play that loses money, we should stop doing it to increase our EV.\nNote that we're not concerned about the effects of deception when we work with game theory.\nWe're only concerned with immediate EV.\nAlso, if we're making money on all our bluffs or our calls, we can make even more money by bluffing more and calling more.\nSo we keep adding bluffs and calling hands until our weakest hands are at the break even point, and then we stop.\nConversely, if we're losing money on some of our bluffing or calling hands, we remove them from our ranges.\nAgain, this results in our weakest bluffing/calling hands being no worse than break even.", "Note that the combination of a candidate list of 3-bet bluff hands and a fixed (but adjustable) bluff% to use with these hands, gives us a lot of flexibility to adjust our 3-bet bluffing as we please.\nAgainst an unknown opponent, we can start with the optimal 20% frequency, and 3-bet {KK+, A5s, A4s} always, and the candidate list 20% of the time.\nBut if we note that the raiser doesn't defend optimally, we might want to adjust this bluff percentage.\nFor example, of the raiser never 4-bet bluffs and only 4-bets a tight value range like {QQ+, AK}, we can go bananas with our 3-bet bluffs.\nWe might decide to double the bluff frequency from 20% to 40% for our list of 152 bluff candidate combos.", "2.3 Summary of Alice's optimal raising strategy We summarize everything we have learned about Alice's optimal strategy for raising, 4-betting and calling 5-bets: She needs to 4-bet 30% of her opening range Her 4-betting range should have a 60/40 value/bluff ratio So Alice's optimal strategy is: Alice open-raises some opening range When she gets 3-bet, she 4-bets 30% of her opening range with a 60/40 ratio between value 4-bets and bluff 4-bets Alice therefore 4-bets 0.60 x 30 =18% of her opening range for value and 0.40 x 30 =12% of her opening range as a bluff If Bob 5-bets all-in, Alice calls with all her value hands, and folds all her 4-bet bluffs So Alice's value hands are the top 18% of her opening range.", "And we do these things calmly, without emotion.\n4.\nOptimal strategy pairs for raiser/3-bettor with a CO raiser out of position After the thorough work with Alice raising ~15% in EP, we can now reap the rewards and quickly run through the same procedure with Alice raising a ~25% range in CO. She now opens a wider range, as a consequence, all other ranges get wider as well.\n4.1 Alice's optimal raising strategy for CO Raising from CO is a bit more situational than raising from EP.", "So Alice's 4-betting range has to contain 60% value hands and 40% bluff hands.\nNow we know everything we need to know about Alice's 4-betting range.\nShe 4-bets 30% of her opening range, and she uses a 60/40 value/bluff ratio.\nWe'll summarize Alice's total optimal strategy below, but first we'll find out how often Bob should 3-bet.We know which type of hands Bob should 5-bet bluff (Axs), and we know he should use a 40/60 value/bluff ratio (which, coincidentally is the opposite of the ratio for Alice's 4-bet range).\nThe last piece of information we need is Bob's3-bet percentage in an optimal 3-betting strategy.\nWe find the answer by observing that Bob should 5-bet bluff enough to make Alice's weakest value hands break even.", "So we have to compute this result on a per-case basis, for every one of Alice's opening ranges.\nWe'll give a quick example in the summary below, and the procedure will be thoroughly discussed later in the article.We summarize everything we have learned about Alice's optimal strategy for raising, 4-betting and calling 5-bets:- She needs to 4-bet 30% of her opening range- Her 4-betting range should have a 60/40 value/bluff ratioSo Alice's optimal strategy is:So Alice's value hands are the top 18% of her opening range.\nFor example, if she opens 15% from UTG, this corresponds to a value range of 0.18 x 0.15 =2.7% of all hands.", "When Alice moves from EP to CO and her opening range changes from ~15% to ~25%, Bob responds by loosening up his 3-betting range dramatically.\nThis is an interesting observation.\nThose of you who use a more or less static 3-betting range (for example, the generic {JJ+, AQ} without any 3-bet bluffing that is recommended on many low limit forums) now have game theoretical \"proof\" that we can get away with a lot of 3-bet bluffing on the button against a CO raiser.", "So let's begin defining Bob's optimal 3-bet/5-bet strategy in position against Alice's optimal raise/4-bet/call 5-bet strategy with a ~15% EP range: Bob's pure value range Bob knows that Alice EP range is ~15% (14% to be exact), and therefore he can draw the same conclusion Alice just did, namely that her optimal value 4-betting range is {QQ+, AK}.\nTo profitably 3-bet and 5-bet all-in for value against this range, Bob needs a hand with at least 50% equity.\nAA is obviously such a hand, and we can easily compute some equities to see that KK is the only other possible hand.\nSo Bob ends up with the super tight pure value range {KK+}.\nSo Bob will 3-bet {KK+} and 5-bet them all-in if Alice 4-bets.", "More about that later in the article.", "Bob chooses value hands that are at least 50% against this range, and his pure value range becomes {KK+}.\nThen he adds Axs hands as 5-bet bluffs until Alice's weakest value hands (QQ and AK) are break even against his total 5-bet range.Alice then calls her remaining 73 BB to win a 189.5 bb pot (1.5 from the blinds, 100 from Bob, 27 from Alice's 4-bet), so her pot odds are 128.5 : 73.\nShe needs minimum 73(/128.5 + 73) =36% equity to profit from calling, so Bob makes sure her weakest value hands have against his 5-bet-range.\nLater in the article we'll show that Bob ends up with a total 5-bet range of {KK+, A5s, A4s} when Alice's value range is {QQ+, AK}This gives Bob {KK+, A5s, A4s} =20 value combos that he 3-bets, planning to 5-bet all-in.", "However, this isn't a big job, we simply do the math once and for all against each of Alice's ranges and memorize the numbers we need (and we'll look at Alice's CO range in a minute).\nSo, finally: Bob's optimal 3-bet strategy against Alice's optimal raising strategy in EP {Bob's total 3-bet range} ={value hands and 5-bet-bluff hands} + {3-bet bluff hands} ={KK+, A5s, A4s} + 20% x {A9s-A6s,ATo-A8o,K9s-K6s,KJo-K9o,Q9s-Q6s,QJo-Q9o} Bob always 3-bets {KK+, A5s, A4s} and 5-bets all-in after a 4-bet.\nIf he has one of the 152 combos from his candidate list for 3-bet bluffing, he uses a randomizer and 3-bet bluffs 20% of the time, and he folds to a 4-bet.", "Just keep an eye on the other players to see if they are trying to exploit your loose 3-betting (tighten up a bit if they do), and you'll do very well in this spot.\nAnother leak you'll see is spazzy 4-betting from players with insufficient understanding of the theory behind optimal 3-bet/4-bet/5-bet wars.\nThis might happen when you have driven someone crazy with your loose 3-betting, and he starts to tilt.\nOr when someone tries to fight back in a controlled manner, but he doesn't quite know how to do it (so he starts 4-bet bluffing way too much).\nThe first thing you have to realize when you are playing optimally, and then spotting a leak, is this: It's not necessary to deviate from optimal play to benefit from his mistakes.", "To use it, we only need to memorize the candidate range once and for all, plus one number (the % we 3-bet bluff the candidate hands).\nLet's compute the number to use against Alice's EP range: To effectively have 30 bluff combos from the candidate list in our 3-betting range, we need to use each of them 30/152 =20% of the time.\nNote that this percentage isn't universal, like Alice's fixed 4-bet bluff percentage (15%) is for all her opening ranges.\nTo see this, note that Bob's value range varies with Alice's opening range, but the candidate list of 3-bet bluff hands is static (we have simply chosen some hands to use).\nSo Bob will have to calculate a new bluff% to use for his candidate list against each of Alice's opening ranges.", "The effective pot odds for Alice's 4-bet bluffs are 17 : 23.5, and she can make a profit by 4-bet bluffing any two (of the hands she open-raised) if Bob folds his 3-betting hands more than 23.5/(23.5 + 17) =58%.Bob can't allow Alice to 4-bet bluff any two cards profitably, so he defends optimally by folding exactly 58% of the time, and 5-betting all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs as we shall soon see) 42% of the time.\nTherefore, 42% of Bob's 3-bets need to be value hands that he plans to 5-bet all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs).", "Correct.\nAgainst Alice's tight and optimally played ~15% EP opening range, QQ and AK aren't strong enough to use as value hands, even if they have strong equity against Alice's total opening range.\nThe reason is that they can not profitably get the whole stack in Against the range Alice is willing to get all-in with, namely {QQ+, AK}.", "When Alice 4-bets to 27bb, she is risking 23.5bb (27bb minus he 3.5bb raise) more to win a 17bb pot (1.5bb from the blinds + Alice's 3.5bb raise + Bob's 12bb 3-bet).\nThe effective pot odds for Alice's 4-bet bluffs are 17 : 23.5, and she can make a profit by 4-bet bluffing any two (of the hands she open-raised) if Bob folds his 3-betting hands more than 23.5/(23.5 + 17) =58%.\nBob can't allow Alice to 4-bet bluff any two cards profitably, so he defends optimally by folding exactly 58% of the time, and 5-betting all-in

for the right job.\nBob will therefore flat QQ, AK and various other medium strong hands/implied odds hands after a ~15% open-raise from Alice.\nThe optimal flatting range depends on how Bob thinks Alice plays postflop, what he thinks the players in the blinds will do, how they play postflop, their stack sizes, etc.\nSo we leave the construction of an optimal flatting range to Bob.\nNote that 3-betting QQ and AK for value against a ~15% EP raiser is equivalent to assuming the raiser isn't playing optimally.\nIf you feel these two hands can always be 3-bet and 5-bet all-in for value against this EP range, you can assume it's because the players you meet don't defend well against 3-bets out of position.", "His value range also includes some 5-bet bluffs, and the next step is to find these.\nThen we pick a range of 3-bet bluffs that Bob plans to fold to a 4-bet.\nWe'll also talk about Bob's flatting range.\nThese are medium strong hands that are playable, but they are not strong enough to 4-bet for value,and they are too strong to use as bluffs, so Bob flat-calls with them.\nBob's flatting range can be viewed as a completely separate part of Bob's overall strategy, and we don't have to be concerned with it when constructing optimal ranges for 3-betting/4-betting/5-betting.", "Against such players, QQ and AK might be used as value 3-bet/5-bet hands, since our opponents play far from optimally against our 3-bets.\nBut don't 3-bet QQ/AK for value against a ~15% opening range in the hands of a player like Alice.\nShe plays optimally against our 3-bets, so 3-betting

moves from a ~15% EP range to a ~25% CO range, our 3-bet bluff candidate frequency doubles.\nWe only need to memorize the candidate list, and these two numbers (20% vs EP and 40% vs CO), and then we know all we need to know about 3-bet bluffing optimally against Alice's EP/CO ranges.", "Damn!", "She also knows how often she should 4-bet bluff with these hands (15%).\nAlice clicks the random number generator, planning to 4-bet to 27bb ($27) if it returns a number between 0 and 15, and otherwise she folds.\n: The randomize returns 39, so Alice folds this time.", "We now define a 3-bet for value as a 3-bet where we plan to 5-bet all-in after a 4-bet.\nIf this is not our plan, we are making a 3-bet bluff that we will fold to a 4-bet.\nTo make these percentages easy to remember, we round Bob's optimal 3-bet value/bluff ratio to 40/60.\nSo now we know that 60% of Bob's 3-bets should be bluffs, and 40% should be for value (including some 5-bet bluffs).\nBut we still don't know how many hands Bob should 3-bet overall.\nTo find this number, we first have to find which hands Bob can 5-bet for value.", "First and foremost: Do I have a value hand that wants to get all-in, or do I have a bluff hand that I will fold to further aggression?\nAren't willing to fold hands that are strong at the early stages, but turn into weak hands when Villain keeps reraising Let's look at Example 1.4 again.\nHero open-raised AJs (correctly), and he got 3-bet.\nHe then decided that his AJs was a good hand against Villain's 3-bet range (debatable, but not a big mistake), so he 4-bet for value
