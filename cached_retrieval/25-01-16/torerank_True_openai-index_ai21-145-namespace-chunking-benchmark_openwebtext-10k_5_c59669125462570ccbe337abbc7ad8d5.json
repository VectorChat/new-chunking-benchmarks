["German soldiers' letters and memoirs reveal their terrible reasoning: Slavs were 'the Asiatic-Bolshevik' horde, an inferior but threatening race.\nOnly a minority of officers and men were Nazi members.\nIn 1989, the British historian Richard J. Evans wrote that right from the beginning of the war against the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht fought a genocidal war of \"extreme brutality and barbarism\".\nEvans noted that the Wehrmacht officers regarded the Russians as \"sub-human\", were from the time of the invasion of Poland in 1939 telling their troops that war was caused by \"Jewish vermin\", and explained to the troops that the war against the Soviet Union was a war to wipe out what were variously called \"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans\", the \"Mongol hordes\", the \"Asiatic flood\" and the \"red beast\".", "As such, all Soviet POWs considered to be commissars together with all Jewish POWs were to be handed over to the Einsatzgruppen to be shot.\nThe OKW attached great importance to the killings of POWs believed to be commissars as it was believed that if the captured commissars reached POW camps in Germany that they would stage another German Stab-in-the-back myth (Dolchsto\u00df) like that believed to have caused Germany's defeat in World War I.", "The attitude of German soldiers towards atrocities committed on Jews and Poles in World War II was also studied using photographs and correspondence left after the war.\nPhotographs serve as a valuable source of knowledge; taking them and making albums about the persecution of Jews was a popular custom among German soldiers.\nThese pictures are not the official propaganda of the German state but represent personal experience.\nTheir overall attitude is antisemitic.", "Based on what they had learned during the Mogilev Conference, one Wehrmacht officer told his men 'Where the partisan is, there is the Jew and where the Jew is, there is the partisan'.\nThe 707th Infantry Division of the Wehrmacht put this principle into practice during an 'anti-partisan' sweep that saw the division shoot 10,431 people out of the 19,940 it had detained during the sweep while suffering only two dead and five wounded in the process.", "British historian Ian Kershaw wrote that the genocide and extreme brutality used by the Nazis was their way of ensuring the Lebensraum (\"living space\") for the people who met the strict requirements of being part of Hitler's Aryan Herrenvolk (\"Aryan master race\") and the elimination of the Slavic people.\nThe Nazi revolution was broader than just the Holocaust.\nIts second goal was to eliminate Slavs from central and eastern Europe and to create a Lebensraum for Aryans.\nAs Bartov (The Eastern Front; Hitler's Army) shows, it barbarised the German armies on the eastern front.\nMost of their three million men, from generals to ordinary soldiers, helped exterminate captured Slav soldiers and civilians.\nThis was sometimes cold and deliberate murder of individuals (as with Jews), sometimes generalised brutality and neglect.", "German soldiers used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women \u2013 and other women as well \u2013 with the words 'Whore for Hitler's troops' and rape them.\nFollowing their capture some German soldiers vividly bragged about committing rape and rape-homicide.\nSusan Brownmiller argues that rape played a pivotal role in Nazi aim to conquer and destroy people they considered inferior, such as Jews, Russians, and Poles.\nAn extensive list of rapes committed by German soldiers was compiled in the so called 'Molotov Note' in 1942.\nBrownmiller points out that Nazis used rape as a weapon of terror.", "Such views helped to explain why 3,300,000 of the 5,700,000 Soviet POWs taken by the Germans died in captivity.\nIn 1992, Omer Bartov noted that the three leaders of the \"new revisionism\" in German history that sparked the Historikerstreit of the late 1980s were all in some ways seeking to promote the image of the Wehrmacht as a force for the good, and seeking to portray the Wehrmacht as a victim of the Allies rather the victimizer of the peoples of Europe, writing of \"...the bizarre inversion of the Wehrmacht's roles proposed by all three exponents of the new revisionism, whereby overtly or by implication the Army is transformed from culprit to saviour, from an object of hatred and fear to one of empathy and pity, from victimizer to victim\".", "Specifically, Bartov noted that: Michael St\u00c3\u00bcrmer's geographical interpretation of German history meant that Germany's \"mission\" in Central Europe was to serve as a bulwark against the Slavic menace from the East in both World Wars.\nErnst Nolte's argument about a \"casual nexus\" with the National Socialist genocide as a logical, if extreme response to the horrors of Communism led to Wehrmacht crimes in the Soviet Union being portrayed as essentially justified.\nThis was even more the case as Nolte insisted that Operation Barbarossa was as Hitler claimed a \"preventive war\", which meant that for Nolte, Wehrmacht war crimes were portrayed as a defensive response to the threat posed to Germany by the \"Asiatic hordes\".", "Even more extreme was the case in Serbia, where the majority of the Jews there were murdered by the Wehrmacht, not the SS.\nGerman forces and Usta\u0161e collaborators lead a column of Serbs to the \u0160abac internment camp during anti-partisan 'cleansing' operations.\nAt \u0160abac in Dulag 183, a German transit camp for POWs in World War II Serbia, which opened in September 1941 (and closed in September 1944), Partisan POWs and members of their families were held.\nIt is estimated that more than 5,000 persons were executed, not counting Jews and Roma people.", "In Der Arzt von Stalingrad (The Doctor from Stalingrad) of 1958, dealing with German POWs in the Soviet Union, the Germans are portrayed as more civilized, humane and intelligent than the Soviets, who are shown for the most part as Mongol savages who brutalized the German prisoners.\nOne of the German POWs, the dashing Doctor Sellnow (Walter Reyer), successfully seduces the beautiful and tough Red Army Captain Alexandra Kasalniskaya (Eva Bartok), who prefers him to the sadistic and hideously deformed camp commandant Piotr Markov (Hannes Messemer), which as Bartov comments is also meant to show that even in defeat, German men were more sexually virile and potent than their Russian counterparts.", "Many officers therefore willingly embraced National Socialist ideology in the 1930s.\nActing on his own initiative, the Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg had purged the Army of all its Jewish personnel in February 1934.\nOn December 8, 1938, the Army leadership had instructed all officers to be thoroughly well versed in National Socialism and to apply its values in all situations.", "On 17 July 1941 the OKW declared that the Wehrmacht was to: [F]ree itself from all elements among the prisoners of war considered Bolshevik driving forces.\nThe special situation of the Eastern Campaign therefore demands special measures [an euphemism for killing] which are to be carried out free from bureaucratic and administrative influence and with a willingness to accept responsibility.", "Central European Jewish refugees, mostly Austrians, were shot by troops of predominantly Austrian origin in retaliation for casualties inflicted by Serbian partisans on the German Army.\nThe orders issued by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel in September 1941 called for the German Army to shoot 100 Serbs for every German soldier killed by the Serb guerrillas and did not call for Jews to be singled out.\nDue to rampant anti-Semitism in the German officer corps, Serbian Jews were scapegoated and targeted for mass retaliatory shootings.", "In the Soviet Union women were kidnapped by German forces for prostitution; one report by the International Military Tribunal stated that \"in the city of Smolensk the German Command opened a brothel for officers in one of the hotels into which hundreds of women and girls were driven; they were mercilessly dragged down the street by their arms and hair.\"", "In response, Field-Marshal Wilhelm Keitel wrote: 'These scruples accord with the soldierly concepts of a chivalrous war!\nHere we are concerned with the extermination of an ideology.\nThat is why I approve and defend this measure'.", "Attitudes like the ones expressed above colored all the instructions that came to Wehrmacht troops in the summer of 1939 as a way of preparing for the attack on Poland.", "At Mirgorod, the 62nd Infantry Division executed 'the entire Jewish population (168 people) for associating with partisans'.\nAt Novomoskovsk, the 444th Security Division reported that they had killed '305 bandits, 6 women with rifles (Flintenweiber), 39 prisoners-of-war and 136 Jews'.\nIn revenge for a partisan attack that had killed one German soldier, the Ersatz-Brigade 202 'as an act of retaliation shot 20 Jews from the villages of Bobosjanka and Gornostajewka and burnt down 5 Jew-houses'.", "Bartov went on to state that as late as the 1991 film Mein Krieg (My War), featuring interview footage of six German veterans juxtaposed with their amateur films the veterans shot during the war, contains strong hints that the interviewees saw and/or were involved in war crimes with at one point a mass grave of civilians in Russia being glimpsed in the background of one of the amateur films; but the point is not pressed by the film-makers.", "Other sources estimate that rapes of Soviet women by the Wehrmacht range up to 10,000,000 incidents, with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children being born as a result.\nIn Soviet Russia rapes were only a concern if they undermined military discipline.\nSince 1941, rape was theoretically punishable with the death sentence, although rapes were rarely prosecuted in practice and rapes by Germans of non-German women were not taken seriously, nor was it punishable by death, especially in the eastern European territories.", "General Erich von Manstein, in an order to his troops on 20 November 1941 stated: Jewry is the middleman between the enemy at our rear and the still fighting remnants of the Red Army and the Red leadership; more than in Europe, it [Jewry] occupies all key posts of the political leadership and administration, of trade and crafts and forms the nucleus for all disquiet and possible revolts.\nThe Jewish-Bolshevist system must be exterminated once and for all.", "The Wehrmacht also worked very closely with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering members of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union.\nOn October 10, 1941 General Walther von Reichenau drafted an order to be read to the troops under his command stating that: 'the soldier must achieve full understanding of the necessity for a harsh but just vengeance against Jewish subhumanity'.\nUpon hearing of Reichenau's Severity Order, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group South announced his 'complete agreement' with it, and sent out a circular to all of the Army generals under his command urging them to send out their own versions of the Severity Order, which would impress upon the troops the need to exterminate Jews.", "In August 1941. the staff doctor assigned to the Sixth Army, Gerhart Panning, learned about captured Russian dumdum bullets by using Jewish POWs.\nTo determine the effects of this type of ammunition on German soldiers, he decided to test them on other human beings after asking SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer (Colonel) and a member of the SD Paul Blobel for some 'guinea pigs', (Jewish POWs).", "Under the German occupation, a widespread system of sexual slavery (forced prostitution) was instituted.\nThe Wehrmacht also ran brothels where women were forced to work.\nThe reason for establishing these brothels was the German officials' fear of venereal disease and onanism (masturbation).\nThe Oberfeldarzt der Wehrmacht (Chief Field Doctor of the Wehrmacht) drew attention to \"the danger of [the] spread of homosexualism\".", "In particular, both Moltke and Admiral Canaris noted that the German claim that Soviet POWs had no rights because the Soviet Union had not ratified the Geneva Convention was invalid as Germany had ratified the Geneva Convention and thus under international law was obliged to provide humane treatment for the POWs in its care.", "Rapes were allowed in practice by the German military (officially forbidden, however) in eastern and southeastern Europe, while northern and western countries were relatively spared.\nIn Occupied Denmark, which initially agreed to collaborate with Nazi Germany, rapes were not widespread, and German officials promised to punish them.\nBy contrast thousands of Soviet female nurses, doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured, and were often murdered afterwards.", "Examples of mass rapes in Soviet Union committed by German soldiers include: Smolensk: German command opened a brothel for officers in which hundreds of women and girls were driven by force, often by arms and hair.", "In his 2004 essay \"Celluloid Soldiers\" about post-war German films, the Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that German films of the 1950s showed the average German soldier as a heroic victim: noble, tough, brave, honourable and patriotic, while fighting hard in a senseless war for a regime that he did not care for.\nThe 08/15 film trilogy of 1954\u201355 concerns a sensitive young German soldier named Asch (Joachim Fuchsberger).\nNo mention is ever made of the genocidal aspects of Germany's war in the East with instead the German soldiers being shown as the victims of a war that they can not fathom the reasons for.", "General Franz Halder, contrary to what he claimed after the war, did not oppose the Commissar Order, and instead welcomed it writing that 'Troops must participate in the ideological battle in the Eastern campaign to the end'.\nThe enforcement of the Commissar Order led to thousands of executions.", "In August 1941, following the protests by two Lutheran chaplains about the massacre of a group of Jewish women and children at Byelaya Tserkov, General von Reichenau wrote: The conclusion of the report in question contains the following sentence, 'In the case in question, measures against women and children were undertaken which in no way differ from atrocities carried out by the enemy about which the troops are continually being informed'.\nI have to describe this assessment as incorrect, inappropriate and impertinent in the extreme.\nMoreover this comment was written in an open communication which passes through many hands.\nIt would have been far better if the report had not been written at all.", "In 1986, the German historian Hans Mommsen wrote about the role of the Wehrmacht under National Socialism: The leadership of the Wehrmacht rather willingly made themselves into accomplices in the policy of extermination.\nIt did this by generating the 'criminal orders' and implementing them.\nBy no means did they merely passively support the implementation of their concept, although there was a certain reluctance for reasons of military discipline and a few isolated protests.", "Starting in February 1939, pamphlets were issued that were made required reading in the Army.\nThe content can be gauged by the titles: 'The Officer and Politics', 'Hitler's World Historical Mission', 'The Army in the Third Reich', 'The Battle for German Living Space', 'Hands off Danzig!\n', and 'The Final Solution of the Jewish Question in the Third Reich'.", "Throughout the war Germany engaged in numerous experiments on human prisoners and POWs.\nThe Wehrmacht had full knowledge of those experiments, and performed some of its own.\nIt provided assistance regarding: Experiments on homosexuals: Wehrmacht doctors wanted to 'cure' homosexuality by hormone treatments and putting homosexuals into battle.\nExperiments on prisoners at Auschwitz-Birkenau by doctor Emil Kaschub.\nKaschub came from Upper Silesia and was an ensign in the Wehrmacht (he was not a member of the SS).", "In their memoirs, German Army generals claimed that the war had been a 'clean war' on their part with the Army fighting because of the noble Prussian-German traditions, patriotism and a deep sense of honour and duty and that National Socialism had virtually no influence on the Army.\nIn this version, almost all German war crimes were the work of the SS and any 'excesses' committed by the Army were only the product of a long and bitter war and were no different from Allied war crimes.", "On 6 August 1941, the OKW declared that Soviet POWs capable of work were to receive 2,200 calories/day and those not capable of work 2,040 calories/day.\nOn 21 October 1941, the OKW ordered a huge reduction in the food rations for Soviet POWs, with POWs incapable of work henceforth to receive only 1,490 calories/day.\nIn a meeting of senior generals called at Or\u0161a on 13 November 1941, the Army's First quarter-master General Eduard Wagner stated \"Non-working prisoners of war in the camps are to starve\".", "Bartov noted that the clear impression that these films give is that the average German soldier who fought on the Eastern Front was a hero worthy of the highest admiration.\nThis in turn led to a tendency to portray the war in the East in a manner that was devoid of its political context with the war being reduced to struggle between German soldiers whom the audiences were expected to like and admire vs. vast hordes of nameless, faceless, brutal Russian soldiers.\nIn such a narrative, war crimes by the Wehrmacht had no place.", "At the end of the war in 1945, several Wehrmacht generals made a statement that defended the actions against partisans, the executions of hostages and the use of slave labor as necessary to the war effort.\nThe generals contended that the Holocaust was committed by the SS and its partner organizations, and that the Wehrmacht command had been unaware of these actions in the death camps.\nThe statement said that the armed forces had fought honorably and left the impression that the Wehrmacht had not committed war crimes.", "In the summer of 1941, the SS Cavalry Brigade commanded by Hermann Fegelein during the course of 'anti-partisan' operations in the Pripyat Marshes killed 699 Red Army soldiers, 1,100 partisans and 14,178 Jews.\nBefore the operation, Fegelein had been ordered to shoot all adult Jews while driving the women and children into the marshes.\nAfter the operation, General Max von Schenckendorff, who commanded the Army Group Centre Rear Area ordered on 10 August 1941 that all Wehrmacht security divisions when on anti-partisan duty were to emulate Fegelein's example and organized between 24\u201326 September 1941 in Mogilev, a joint SS-Police-Wehrmacht seminar on how best to murder Jews.", "On 6 July 1941 Einsatzkommando 4b of Einsatzgruppe C \u2013 which was operating in Tarnopol at the time \u2013 sent a report which noted 'Armed forces surprisingly welcome hostility against the Jews'.\nOn 8 September 1941 Einsatzgruppe D reported that relations with the German Army were 'excellent'.\nFranz Walter Stahlecker of Einsatzgruppe A wrote in September 1941 that Army Group North had been exemplary in co-operating with his men in murdering Jews and that relations with the Fourth Panzer Army commanded by General Erich Hoepner were 'very close, almost cordial'.", "The background behind the Barbarossa Decree was laid out by Hitler during a high level meeting with military officials on 30 March 1941, where he declared that war against Soviet Russia would be a war of extermination, in which both the political and intellectual elites of Russia would be eradicated by German forces, in order to ensure a long-lasting German victory.", "One SS man who saw the killings at Byelaya Tserkov described them as follows: I went to the woods alone.\nThe Wehrmacht had already dug a grave.\nThe children were brought along in a tractor.\nI had nothing to do with this technical procedure.\nThe Ukrainians were standing around trembling.\nThe children were taken down from the tractor.\nThey were lined up along the top of the grave and shot so that they fell into it.\nThe Ukrainians did not aim at any particular part of the body.\nThey fell into the grave.\nThe wailing was indescribable.\nI shall never forget the scene throughout my life.\nI find it very hard to bear.\nI particularly remember a small fair-haired girl who took me by the hand.\nShe too was shot later..\nThe grave was near some woods.\nIt was not near the rifle-range.\nThe execution must had taken place in the afternoon at about 3.30 or 4.00.\nIt took place the day after the discussions at the Feldkommandanten...Many children were hit four or five times before they died.", "According to a RHSA report of 5 December 1941, the Wehrmacht had since 22 June handed over to the Einsatzgruppen 16,000 Soviet POWs to be \"liquidated\".\nA Typical of the Wehrmacht's treatment of Soviet POWs were the reports of the 11th Army commanded by Erich von Manstein on the \"wastage\" rates in the first half of 1942.\nBetween the launching of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941 and the following spring, 2.8 million of the 3.2 million prisoners taken died while in German hands.", "Bartov wrote that the portrayal of the Soviet guards as mostly Asian shows disturbing affinities to war-time Nazi propaganda, where the Red Army was often described as \"the Asiatic horde\".\nA recurring theme in Der Arzt von Stalingrad was that the German soldiers were being punished for crimes that they had not committed.\nIn the 1959 film Hunde, wolt ihr ewig leben?\n(Dogs, do you want to live forever?\n), which deals with the Battle of Stalingrad, the focus is on celebrating the heroism of the German soldiers in that battle, who are shown as valiantly holding out against overwhelming odds with no mention at all of what those soldiers were fighting for, namely National Socialist ideology or the Holocaust.", "The decree, issued by Field Marshal Keitel a few weeks before Operation Barbarossa, exempted punishable offenses committed by enemy civilians (in Russia) from the jurisdiction of military justice.\nSuspects were to be brought before an officer who would decide if they were to be shot.", "In a number of occupied countries, the Wehrmacht's response to partisan attacks by resistance movements was to take and shoot hostages.\nExamples are: Putten (Netherlands), Oradour-sur-Glane (France), Telav\u00c3\u00a5g (Norway) and Lidice (Czech Republic).\nAs many as 100 hostages were murdered for every German killed.", "German soldiers as well as police members took pictures of Jewish executions, deportations, humiliation and the abuse to which they were also subjected.\nAccording to researchers, pictures indicate the consent of the photographers to the abuses and murders committed.\nThis consent is the result of several factors, including the anti-Semitic ideology and prolonged, intensive indoctrination.\nArchival evidence as to the reaction to policies of racial extermination can also be traced in various letters that survived the war.", "This impression is further reinforced by the comic exchanges between the decent and upright Harras and various thuggish Nazis.\nOfficers such as Harras may have served a criminal regime, but Des Teufels General seems to suggest that they were never a part of that regime.", "Hitler underlined that executions would not be a matter for military courts, but for the organised action of the military.", "Bartov commented that given the intense indoctrination in the Wehrmacht about how the war against the Soviet Union was a war to destroy \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" that Asch would most definitely have known what they were fighting for.\nThe war on the Eastern Front was portrayed in a manner that suggested that all who fought in the war were equally victims, but since the focus in the 08/15 films is on the unit commanded by Asch inevitably the impression is given that it was German soldiers who were the primary victims of the war.\nThe term 8/15 refers to a type of German machine gun used in World War I that was manufactured in such quantities that 8/15 became German Army slang for anything was standard issue, which implied that Asch and the soldiers under his command were Everyman characters of the war on the Eastern Front.", "It is estimated that over a million children were born to Russian women, fathered by German soldiers.\nAuthor Ursula Schele, estimated in the Journal \"Zur Debatte um die Ausstellung Vernichtungskrieg.\nVerbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941-1944\" that one in ten women raped by German soldiers would have become pregnant, and therefore it is probable, while not provable, that up to ten million women in the Soviet Union could have been raped by the Wehrmacht.", "The German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster was to write in 1989 that it was simply not true as most German Army commanders claimed in their memoirs and some German historians like Ernst Nolte were still claiming that the Commissar Order was not enforced.", "In the following months reports continued to be filed regarding the executions of Soviet commissars.\nThe last known account of the liquidation of a political officer came from units of Army Group South in July 1943.", "The order cast the war against the Soviet Union as one of ideological and racial differences, and it provided for the immediate liquidation of political commissars in the Red Army.\nThe order was formulated on Hitler's behalf in 1941 by the Wehrmacht command and distributed to field commanders.", "German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster, a leading expert on the subject of Wehrmacht war crimes, argued the Wehrmacht played a key role in the Holocaust and it is wrong to ascribe the Shoah as solely the work of the SS while the Wehrmacht were a more or less passive and disapproving bystander.", "According to the historian Regina M\u00c3\u00bchlh\u00c3\u00a4user, the Wehrmacht also used sexual violence and undressing in numerous cases of interrogations.\nM\u00c3\u00bchlh\u00c3\u00a4user adds that the number of illegitimate children born in the occupied regions did not exceed the prewar time.\nShe comes to the conclusion that rapes on the Eastern front were not singular cases but has to admit that the state of source material is very poor.", "Bartov also wrote that German film-makers liked to show the heroic last stand of the 6th Army at Stalingrad, but none has so far showed the 6th Army's massive co-operation with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering Soviet Jews in 1941 during its march across the Ukraine.\nLikewise, Bartov commented that German films tended to dwell on the suffering of the 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad and its aftermath without reflecting on the fact that it was the Germans who invaded the Soviet Union and that the Russians were fighting to defend their country.", "Up to 13,000 soldiers and between 120,000 and 200,000 civilians were killed by German-led forces during the Warsaw Uprising.\nAt least 5,000 German regular soldiers assisted the SS in
