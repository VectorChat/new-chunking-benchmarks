["The burning in 1789 of Christian Murphy for coining received practically no attention from the newspapers ( perhaps owing to practical limitations on how much news they could publish across only four pages ) but it may have been enacted by Sir Benjamin Hammett a former sheriff of London\nHammett was also an MP and in 1790 he introduced to Parliament a Bill for Altering the Sentence of Burning Women\nHe denounced the punishment as \" the savage remains of Norman policy \" which \" disgraced our statutes \" as \" the practice did the common law \"\nHe also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution\nWilliam Wilberforce and Hammett were not the first men to attempt to end the burning of women\nAlmost 140 years earlier during the Interregnum a group of lawyers and laymen known as the Hale Commission ( after its chairman Matthew Hale ) was tasked by the House of Commons to take \" into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law \"\nAmong the proposed reforms was the replacement of burning at the stake with hanging but mainly through the objections of various interested parties none of the commission 's proposals made it into law during the Rump Parliament\nHammett was confident though\nHe believed that public opinion was on his side and that \" the House would go with him in the cause of humanity \"\nThe change in execution venues from Tyburn to Newgate also attracted criticism\nFollowing Phoebe Harris 's burning in 1786 as well as questioning the inequality of English law The Times", "= Burning of women in England = In England burning was a legal punishment inflicted on women found guilty of high treason petty treason and heresy\nOver a period of several centuries female convicts were publicly burnt at the stake sometimes alive for a range of activities including coining and mariticide\nWhile men guilty of heresy were also burned at the stake those who committed high treason were instead hanged drawn and quartered\nThe English jurist William Blackstone supposed that the difference in sentencing although \" full as terrible to the sensation as the other \" could be explained by the desire not to publicly expose a woman 's body\nPublic executions were well @-@ attended affairs and contemporary reports detail the cries of women on the pyre as they were burned alive\nIt later became commonplace for the executioner to strangle the convict and for the body to be burned post @-@ mortem\nIn the latter half of the eighteenth century changing attitudes to such public displays prompted Sir Benjamin Hammett MP to denounce the practice in Parliament\nHis bill by no means the first such attempt to end the public burning of women led to the Treason Act 1790 which abolished the sentence\n= = Crimes punishable by burning = =", "complained about the location of the punishment and its effect on locals :", "Another factor was the fate of Sophia Girton found guilty of coining\nHammett 's bill was introduced only four days before Girton 's fate was to be decided but a petition for her respite from burning supported by another sheriff of London ( either Thomas Baker or William Newman ) and brought to King George III 's notice by William Grenville proved successful\nDevereaux suggests that her impending fate lent weight to the eventual outcome of Hammett 's bill which was to abolish the burning of women for treason through the Treason Act 1790\nChristian Murphy who at her execution in 1789 was \" drest in a clean striped gown a white ribbon and a black ribbon round her cap \" was the last woman in England to be burned", "There is something so inhuman in burning a woman for what only subjects a man to hanging that human nature shudders at

been raised by the perceived iniquity of drawing and burning women for coining whereas until 1783 when the halting of executions at Tyburn removed ritualistic dragging from public view men were simply drawn and hanged\nA widening gulf between the numbers of men and women whipped in London ( during the 1790s 393 men versus 47 women ) which mirrors a similar decline in the sending of women to the
