["In 1974, planning for a new ferry on the Ytter\u00f8y service started, although the order was not placed until June 1979.\nThe new ferry, Ytter\u00f8y, cost NOK 10.5 million, had space for 30 cars and was bi-directional.\nIt was put into service in February 1981.\nInnherredsferja II was kept as a reserve.\nThe need for a larger ferry on the Skarnsund service was also pressing.\nCars often had to wait, and if the ferry sailed with full capacity, there was no room for passengers to leave their vehicles.\nWork to procure a new ferry to replace Skarnsund started in 1981.\nThis resulted in the acquisition of the second-hand ferry Mosvik from Bergen, with a capacity of 24 cars, which entered service starting 9 December 1982.", "In 1968, the state granted sufficient guarantees to allow a new ferry to be purchased.\nIn the same year, the road from Framverran via Venneshamn to Kjerringvik was opened.\nThe new ferry was similar to Innherredsferja II; it was built in Kristiansund for NOK 1,555,000 and originally named Skarnsund.\nInnherredsferja was sold to an operator in Agder for NOK 50,000.\nAt the same time, Fremverran and Venneshamn were transferred from the municipality of Verran to Mosvik, while Ytter\u00f8y, Skogn and Frol merged with Levanger.\nIn 1970, the ferries were equipped with televisions.\nThe following year, the company had a deficit of NOK 1.1 million.\nIt transported 195,000 passengers, of which 120,000 took the Vangshylla \u2013 Kjerringvik service.", "In 2000, Innherredsferja started to work on proposals to purchase a new ferry.\nThe following year, it chose to buy Torghatten for NOK 19.2 million from Torghatten Trafikkselskap, and renamed it Ytter\u00f8y II.\nIt was taken into service on 9 November 2002, and Innherredsferja II was sold.\nAt the same time, Innherredsferja and Fosen Trafikklag amended their agreement, whereby Ytter\u00f8y, stationed at Levanger, became the shared reserve ferry.\nThis meant that if a reserve vessel was needed for the Flakk \u2013 R\u00f8rvik Ferry, Ytter\u00f8y II would be sent there, and Ytter\u00f8y used for the Levanger \u2013 Hokstad service.", "Mosvik proved to be too small, with 3,000 cars being left at the quays at Vangshylla and Kjerringvik in 1986.\nAn additional 47 were not catered for on the Ytter\u00f8y service in the same year.\nThe order for Skarnsund II, costing NOK 27 million, was signed in December 1987, and put into service in 1988.\nSkarnsund was sold to Namsos Trafikkselskap for NOK 1, as was Mosvik for NOK 1 million.\nThe following year, Verran Municipality sold its shares in the company.\nIn 1990, the subsidy system was changed, and the company received a fixed subsidy instead of the state covering the deficit.\nThis allowed the company to make a profit, if it managed to rationalize operations.", "In 2004, Bondevik's Second Cabinet and Liberal Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm decided that all ferry services in Norway would become subject to public service obligation (PSO).\nInnherredsferja held a concession until the end of 2006, but would have to bid for the service from 1 January 2007.\nThe company would need expertise in both bidding and increased share capital to succeed in the bidding.\nBy then, Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25% of the company, and the county and the municipality sold their shares to Fosen.\nFollowing this, a meeting was held on Ytter\u00f8y, where Fosen succeeded in securing a sufficient number of shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company.", "In 1964, the company's operations were split into two services, each with a single crossing.\nFollowing the opening of the Skarnsund Bridge in 1991, the Vangshylla \u2013 Kjerringvik Ferry was terminated.\nIn 2005, the company was taken over by Fosen Trafikklag, after the state decided that the route would be subject to public service obligation.\nThe company lost the bid to Nor-Ferjer, and operation ceased at the end of 2006.", "Discussion about splitting the route into two started in the early 1960s.\nThe Public Roads Administration felt that it was unnecessary to have a cross-fjord service, as at the time there was a road from Vangshylla to Levanger which sufficed.\nThe administration was also in the process of building a road from Kjerringvik to Venneshamn, which would allow the ferry to drop that service.\nOn 1 June 1964, the service was split in two: Vangshylla \u2013 Kjerringvik and Hokstad \u2013 Levanger.\nAt the same time, the service was upgraded to a national road connection, and the full responsibility for funding was

metres (89 ft) long vessel cost NOK 1,062,000.\nIt had a capacity for sixteen cars or six trucks.\nPart of the rationale for purchasing the new ferry was the increased traffic across Skarnsund
