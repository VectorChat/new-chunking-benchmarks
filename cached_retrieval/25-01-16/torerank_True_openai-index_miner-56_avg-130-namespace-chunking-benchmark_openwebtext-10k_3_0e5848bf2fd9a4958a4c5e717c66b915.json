["The launch was set for January 27, 1962 and then scrubbed again due to a faulty tank bulkhead.\nThe next date was February 14, and they were forced to scrub one more time due to weather.\nJohn Glenn was actually the coolest of the lot by this point, losing his temper only once when somebody suggested that he could get kicked off his flight for supporting his wife when she didn\u2019t want to see the Vice President.\nFinally, they settled for February 20, 1962 for a launch date.\nKranz had watched enough Atlas rockets blow up to acknowledge that they were gambling with a man\u2019s life this morning.\nSomebody broke one of the hatch bolts while John Glenn was being inserted into the spacecraft.", "He felt that it could have been arranged in advance.\nKraft only replied, \u201cThe President is the boss.\u201d As it turned out, the audio technicians were better informed than he was and had been expecting the call.\nAlan Shepard told Glenn, \u201cSeven, this is the Cape.\nThe President will be talking to you.\u201d Glenn was as surprised as Kranz had been.\n\u201cAh, the President?\nThis is Friendship 7, standing by.\u201d They had trouble patching the President through.\nThe techs gestured to each other for assistance as they stammered out, \u201cHello, Mister President!\u201d In another part of the room, the man monitoring the spacecraft\u2019s systems got Kranz\u2019s attention.", "Over.\u201d Shepard finally told him that they weren\u2019t sure whether the landing bag had deployed.\nAll three retro rockets fired on time and, as Glenn reentered, the Friendship 7 was surrounded by an ion buildup that blocked radio signals.\nIt was a tense wait for the people in Mission Control and those watching the live coverage of the mission.\nFinally, the spacecraft was spotted by the recovery ship USS Noa.\nJohn Glenn was brought on board to the cheers of the Noa\u2018s crew and got a taste of the nation-wide celebration to come when his route back to Cape Canaveral ended with an impromptu parade through the nearby Cocoa Beach.\nThe telemetry readings of the Segment 51 would turn out to be false.", "The last orbit was the worst.\nThe controllers had no new data and they were trying to troubleshoot without letting Glenn know that he could be in serious trouble.\nGlenn figured out that something was up anyway and tried to get them to tell him what it was.\nWhen he returned to dry land, he would tell the controllers exactly what he thought of not having all the information available.\nAs it was, Glenn\u2019s response to the retropack plan was pretty tart: \u201cWhat is the reason for this?\nDo you have a reason?", "Some intermittent communications problem gave Kraft\u2019s team headaches and caused Grissom to growl, \u201cHow can we get to the moon if we can\u2019t even talk between two buildings?\u201d They could have called it a day, but decided to give it another hour.\nThen, shouts from the cockpit sent chills down everybody\u2019s spine.\n\u201cFire!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fire in the cockpit!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bad fire, get us out!\nWe\u2019re burning up.\u201d Then, somebody screamed and they heard nothing else.", "Glenn was troubleshooting some attitude control problems while Mission Control tried to make sense of the data they were getting from the remote sites.\nOnly about half those sites were seeing the Segment 51.\nSome of the design techs suggested making sure the landing bag switch was off and asking Glenn whether he had heard any banging noises when he maneuvered.\nWalt Williams and two of the designers joined Chris Kraft at his console and suggested leaving the retropack on during reentry in the hope it would keep the heat shield in place.\nKraft was convinced it was a false reading and didn\u2019t like that very much.", "Nobody really expected him to obey.\nDuring the third orbit, Gemini 4 was given the Go to depressurize the spacecraft.\nWhile the air in the spacecraft was gradually reduced, McDivitt and White performed final checks on their spacesuits.\nAn inflated pressure suit was like a balloon with a man inside and White had difficulties getting through the hatch.\nHe made it, though, and cavorted around the Gemini with only a thruster gun to manuever.\nHe was obviously having a good time as he made observations on the Earth and space.", "Twenty minutes sped by fast and both the ground team and McDivitt prompted him to begin thinking about getting back into the spacecraft.\nMcDivitt told him, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get back in here before it gets dark.\u201d White reacted like a kid told to come in for supper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the saddest moment of my life.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re going to find it sadder when we have to come down with this whole thing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d White came back through the hatch and they wrestled to get the hatch closed.\nIt had lost its flexibility in the cold of space.\nMission Control had planned to jettison the now unnecessary EVA gear but decided not to press their luck.", "Williams asked, \u201cIf we come in with the retropack attached, what\u2019s the worst that could happen to us?\u201d Kranz could imagine Glenn\u2019s response if he could have heard that question: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018us\u2019?\u201d After a little more discussion, it was decided that they would keep an eye on it, but not to tell John Glenn because they didn\u2019t want to worry him.\nLeaving the retropack on could work, but only if all three retro rockets fired on time.\nIf they didn\u2019t, there was a chance one of the rockets could go off during reentry and kill Glenn.", "Inspections revealed that an umbilical had released prematurely and a dust cover also hadn\u2019t been removed.\nSome people may have thought of \u201cThe Four-Inch Flight,\u201d in which a power cord had also caused a premature shutdown by disconnecting early.\nOnce again, they were lucky.", "During the nineteenth orbit, Cooper\u2019s05 G indicator came on.\nThis would have meant that he had started reentry, but Cooper believed it was a false reading and disabled the fuses leading to it.\nThis disabled an automatic system that would have been used for retrofire.\nCooper would have to fire the retro rockets manually.\nKranz made sure the new plans went out to the remote stations and set up backup communications with John Glenn, the capcom on the Coastal Sentry.\nIt may have occurred to the control team that part of the reason Scott Carpenter had landed so far out of the planned recovery area was that he had fired the retros a few seconds late, but that was the biggest concern.", "He reported a spectacular sunrise, and then the glittering \u201cfireflies\u201d surrounding his spacecraft.\nThose fireflies would turn out to be drops of frozen water from the spacecraft.\nKraft was less than impressed when Kranz relayed that to him.\n\u201cKeep me advised.\u201d The first orbit came to an end with no problems worse than a slight increase of temperature in the cabin.\nThen, Kraft dropped a bombshell on Kranz: \u201cShorty Powers has confirmed that the President will make a call at the end of the first orbit.\nGet with the communications people and make sure everything is set up.\u201d Kranz didn\u2019t like that very much.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of this, but I\u2019m showing an indication of Segment 51.\u201d This was more serious than the President\u2019s phone call.\nSegment 51 was the impact bag deploy.\nIf that had somehow come undone, the heat shield was loose and John Glenn would burn up when he reentered the atmosphere.\nAs they tried to track down the indication, the chief audio technician had the unfortunate duty of telling the president, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten pretty busy down here!\u201d The president answered, \u201cGive me a call when you get the chance.\u201d Some of the readouts suggested that the Segment 51 was a false alarm, but they couldn\u2019t be certain.", "Kranz described the moment when he heard Shepard had entered his spacecraft as \u201csurreal.\u201d This was the moment they had all waited for since signing up.\nThen, things started to go south.\nThey sat through five delays and the weather started to foul up.\nSome of them had to wonder if they were going to face another scrubbed launch.\nPencils tapped on desks and, during one delay, Kraft asked Kranz to get him a pint of milk from the lunch wagon to help calm his stomach.\nShepard was even less patient and barked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fix your little problem and light this candle?\u201d And then the most astonishing routine came over the communications loop.", "\u201c1201-Executive Overflow-No vacant areas.\u201d For some reason, the computer was receiving more data than it could handle and had gone through a restart cycle.\nMission rules told him nothing, so he checked with his computer expert.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a BAILOUT alarm.\nThe computer is busier than hell and has run out of time to get all the work done.\u201d Still clueless, he watched the computer go through some more restarts.\nHe had to make up his mind.\n\u201cFlight, Guidance.\nSomething is wrong with the computer.\nI\u2019ve got a bunch of computer alarms.", "Glynn Lunney oversaw the launch and handed things over to Gene Kranz.\nThings seemed to be proceeding smoothly so far.\nThen, Schirra reported that he had developed a cold and taken an Aspirin.\nLuckily, they had Kleenex on board though Schirra reported that he had to blow pretty hard to clear his nostrils.\nThe flight surgeon recommended a decongestant.\nHis crewmates caught his cold and it did nothing for the mood of any of them.\nBy the third day, Schirra\u2019s bad temper was obvious enough for newspapers to comment, \u201cCaptain Awakes Grumpy.\u201d He curtly vetoed the TV show, leaving an embarrassed PR staff to explain that one to the press.", "The signal from the spacecraft was relayed from Cape Canaveral to the station in Bermuda, and then on to the Canary Islands.\nAn ex-Marine named Llewellyn was in charge at Canary Islands and stammered a bit as he asked Glenn for the spacecraft status.\nAs Glenn rattled off readings, Kranz couldn\u2019t resist smiling.\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one who was nervous.\nBut there was an overtone of victory, as well, and he resisted the urge to yell, \u201cWe\u2019ve got an American in orbit!\u201d NASA had really come a long way since \u201cThe Four Inch Flight.\u201d Glenn\u2019s reports could have been mesmerizing if Kranz didn\u2019t have a job to focus on.", "Llewellyn resorted to high school geometry to determine that Carpenter was going to land at least 200 miles long.\nAs Carpenter began coming back into the atmosphere and they lost radio contact, all the people in the control room could do was pray.\nKranz had only felt this kind of helplessness when he held his wife\u2019s hand during childbirth.\nFinally, Grissom caught Carpenter\u2019s report that his chute had deployed and replied that they would get Air Rescue personnel to him within an hour.\nRescue personnel found an annoyed Carpenter munching on a candy bar.\nCarpenter was heard to comment, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d That made Llewellyn mad.", "The launch went off on May 24, 1962 at 7:45:16 EST.\nThe first orbit looked good, with Scott Carpenter reporting that the temperature in his pressure suit was a little high.\nEverything else was nominal, the ground controllers at each remote station were on the ball, and Carpenter made the planned external observations.\nThe fireflies, a mystery during John Glenn\u2019s flight, were reported by Carpenter as \u201ccapsule emanating,\u201d droplets of water being shed by the skin of his own capsule.\nThen, things began to go downhill.\nDuring the second orbit, Scott Carpenter reported a disagreement between the attitude readouts and what he was seeing out the window.", "DPS DELTA V indicated that the thrust hadn\u2019t built up fast enough.\nThey would have to reset the timer.\nThe other one was simply labeled, FORGET IT.\nThis meant that the command to throttle up the engine had not been executed.\nThey extended the mission by an orbit to see if they could still accomplish all their goals.\nSending commands went from being a hassle to being a major problem due to poor signal strength.\nThe controllers ended up punching in commands manually.\nKranz did not want to lose the test of the LM\u2019s abort system, so he decided to ditch all the other tests if he absolutely had to and focus on that one.", "Problems developed in the thrusters and seat tests and Kraft dived into the task of insuring that the control team was ready for any contingency.\nHe was still the senior flight director and gave Kranz the authority to do the same with his team.\nKranz assured him that he was already on the job.\nThen, Kranz got his first real test in his new role of flight director when Kraft became practically bedridden with influenza six days before the launch.\nThe job of handling the final simulation, pad tests and pre-launch briefings fell on Kranz\u2019s lap.", "The people on the ground concurred and recommended resetting the gyros.\nThis didn\u2019t help, and Carpenter ended up wasting a lot of fuel trying to correct until they suggested that he simply coast until he was ready to start the reentry sequence.\nAs Aurora 7 went into the final orbit, it became obvious that Carpenter would have to make a manual reentry.\nThe Capcom at the Hawaiian station talked him through the checklist for retrofire.\nIn the meantime, he was still having trouble with the temperature on his pressure suit and, by the end of his third orbit, was starting to show signs of overheating.\nAt one point, Chris Kraft snapped to Gus Grissom at CapCom, \u201cDammit, Gus, keep him on task.", "They wore lightweight suits designed only for use inside the spacecraft.\nTheoretically, they should have been able to get into those suits in less than twenty minutes, but in reality, it took about an hour.\nSpace food was still so unappetizing that no one who had actually tasted the stuff blamed John Young for smuggling a corned beef sandwich on Gemini 3.\nKranz compared it to a camper\u2019s worst nightmare and led efforts to keep the crew\u2019s morale up during the mission.\nThe launch of Gemini 7 went smoothly and the ground team wasted no time.\nThe Titan booster for Gemini 6 was on the pad within two hours.", "Do you know what it really takes to be an astronaut?\u201d \u201cNo, Jose, tell me.\u201d \u201cYou should have courage and the right blood pressure and four legs.\u201d \u201cWhy four legs, Jose?\u201d \u201cThey were going to send a dog.\nBut they decided that would be too cruel.\u201d Now who in the world would be playing a recording of comedian Bill Dana\u2019s cowardly astronaut routine at a time like this?\nKranz scrambled to find the cause.\nIf it was coming from anywhere in this room, he was history.\nBut, as it turned out, the launch pad crew were piping it into Shepard\u2019s spacecraft in an attempt to get him to lighten up.\nIt certainly added to the surreal feeling and got grins from a few people in Mission Control.", "He backed down after the fifth day and the crew tried to make up for it by continuing the tradition of Schirra\u2019s humorous signs.\nKraft and Slayton broached the subject of keeping their helmets on during reentry and Schirra blew up.\nAs he later put it in a Sudafed commercial, \u201cHave you ever tried sneezing in one of these?\u201d On the one hand, keeping the helmets on would protect them if the cabin depressurized suddenly.\nOn the other, they still had the colds and risked ear blockage and possible hearing loss if they kept the helmets on.", "The NAA fought them on issues like releasing technical details of the spacecraft and assigning representatives to the control center to help with preparations.\nThey even got into the ongoing debate about the route they would take to the moon.\nOne favorite route was called Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR), in which astronauts would rendezvous with a spacecraft already in orbit and land that spacecraft on the moon.\nAnother route was an underdog called Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR), in which a crew of three astronauts would go into lunar orbit, and then two of them would undock in a smaller spacecraft and land it on the moon.", "While going over the stowage and pre-retro checklists with the Zanzibar CapCom, Cooper reported, \u201cMy automatic control system inverter has failed.\nI\u2019ll have to make a manual reentry.\u201d Zanzibar asked, \u201cHave you tried the standby inverter?\u201d \u201cRoger.\nIt would not start.\u201d They continued with the checklist, and then Cooper made contact with Coastal Sentry: \u201cOh, my automatic inverter failed along with a few other odds and ends.\nI will shoot the retros on manual and then reenter manually also.", "The culprit was a switch that had been accidentally bumped.\nSwitch covers would be included in the future.\nA few hours later, the Spider finally came out of the compartment.\nFor such a fragile spacecraft, the Spider held up well to the repeated firings of the Gumdrop\u2018s main engine over the next few days.\nThey were just getting ready to power up the Spider for testing when McDivitt sprang an unpleasant surprise on them.\nSchweickart had been space sick for days and might not be able to perform a planned spacewalk that would have taken him from the lunar module to the command module.", "Thinking fast, the crew abandoned the planned rendezvous maneuver and powered down equipment.\nKraft could have aborted the mission right then, but decided to give it a few more orbits to troubleshoot and see if the oxygen levels began to level out.\nTo be on the safe side, Kraft had recovery teams redeployed to emergency landing areas.\nThe White Team began to move into place to back up Kraft\u2019s Red Team.\nThe fuel cell situation began to stabilize, but it was obvious that they weren\u2019t able to operate at full power and some of the experiments were canceled.\nKraft wanted to go for a full day and began preparing for the handover.", "There were a few unresolved items and glitches, informally referred to as \u201cfunnies\u201d, in Kraft\u2019s logbook.\nThey were minor items and easily resolved, and then Kranz turned his attention to preparing Gemini 4 for drifting flight so the crew could get some sleep.\nDirect contact with the spacecraft would be sporadic as its orbit took it into areas not covered by the tracking network.\nKranz\u2019s team spent most of this quiet time to do a more in-depth analysis of the spacecraft\u2019s systems and orbital trajectory.", "\u201cIt was gruesome,\u201d was all John Hodge could get out.\nChris Kraft was on the phone with Deke Slayton.\nSlayton described fire spewing out from inside the capsule and molten metal running down the sides.\nThere was nothing more they could do for the crew.\nThey had lost three pilots in the worst way imaginable, in a ground test that shouldn\u2019t have been much of a risk.\nMost thought it had taken only seconds.\nIt was a harsh reminder of the hazards of space flight.\nKranz organized a meeting of his branch and flight control team in a nearby auditorium.\nAt Hodge\u2019s request, he also included the civil servants, Philco controllers and spacecraft contractors.", "Envisioning explosions and an inferno that consumed the entire pad, he rushed to the Center and had trouble finding a parking space.\nEvery available controller was reporting in to see what they could do to help.\nThe controllers still in the control room were too stunned to say much.\nThose still capable of focusing were going over data at their stations.\nMost of the rest were milling around, trying to make sense of the tragedy.", "Efforts to get them out took several minutes and they found the crew in a heap next to the hatch.\nThey had obviously been trying to undo it but simply couldn\u2019t in time.\nThe Aftermath Gene Kranz had just gotten dressed for a night out with his wife when he got a knock on the door.\nHe thought it was just the baby-sitter, so he called, \u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming.\u201d He went downstairs and the man at the door was flight controller Jim Hannigan.\n\u201cThey had a fire on the launchpad.\nThey think the crew is dead!\u201d Kranz turned on the TV to see what the reporters had found out so far.\nIt wasn\u2019t much.\nChris Kraft had acted quickly to lock down Mission Control so they could investigate.", "A few minutes later, he reported that the booster was moving away from the Gemini in a lower orbit.\nIt was a quick lesson in orbital mechanics.\nBy accelerating toward the Titan, McDivitt had boosted the Gemini into a higher orbit and lost ground speed.\nTo catch the booster, he would have had to drop into a lower orbit and gain ground speed.\nThat was counterintuitive to a pilot used to the idea that he had to accelerate toward the object he wanted to rendezvous with.\nAfter another attempt to rendezvous with the booster, Kraft decided that they should give it up.", "We need to get going on our own work.\u201d Kranz just handed over the logbook, went down to his office to get a little work done, and then knocked off early to beat the rush hour traffic.\nThe crew received their \u201cgo\u201d to enter the capsule.\nGrissom plugged his suit into the oxygen supply and immediately reported a sour smell.\nHodge paused the countdown for air sampling and the countdown resumed at 1:25 p.m. Chris Kraft had planned to head up his Red Team for the launch and went down to the MCC for the planned handover.\nHodge decided to hang around in case the test dragged on as it had for some of the plugs-in work.", "Because the Agena spacecraft had given them so many problems, nobody was taking any chances that it might misinterpret a command and go wild.\nThe Agena had an error checking routine that helped controllers verify that the command being put in the onboard computer\u2019s memory was the one they had sent.\nAs a backup, the remote site computers performed an echo check by automatically recording each command as it was converted into radio waves and checking it with the intended command load.\nIf the telemetry from the Agena\u2019s error checking routine failed, controllers could perform a manual check that would take several hours or save time by basing their decisions on the echo check.", "Systems engineer John Aaron had helped design the fuel cells and suggested running a load test.\nKranz had the crew power up and then send an oxygen purge through the fuel cell.\nThis would hopefully get rid of excess moisture and impurities in the cell.\nHe timed it so that, if something went wrong, they could run on batteries until they could get to a convenient spot to start reentry.\nThe fuel cell held up to the load test and Kranz watched the oxygen flow to the fuel cell begin to increase gradually.\nBy the time Hodge\u2019s Blue Team took over, they had worked out a plan to power up systems incrementally for the next few days.", "Cooper made some celestial observations and took several pictures of Earth and celestial objects during a quiet period in his schedule, and then set a milestone of his own when he became the first American to sleep in orbit.\nHis heart rate dropped low enough to alarm the physicians, who had CapCom wake him briefly to make certain he was okay.\nThe team fell into a mode of relaxed alertness and kept an eye on things until Kraft\u2019s team came back on duty.", "Wally Schirra had brought along signs that read, \u201cDeke Slayton, are you a turtle?\u201d and \u201cBeat Army.\u201d Deke Slayton at the Capcom position recorded his answer and Gemini 7 shot back, \u201cOh, Wally has a sign.\nIt says \u2018Beat Navy.\n'\u201d Since it was the

excellent flight director.\nWhile establishing the mission rules, Bill Tindall livened things up with his Tindallgrams.\nA typical Tindallgram might read: \u201cThere is another thing about powered descent crew procedures that really bugged me.", "Luckily, they had spares on hand and they were able to replace it with only a minor delay.\nWalt Williams kept one eye on the weather while they waited.\nWhen the hold was over, Williams started the poll of the controllers, spacecraft and test conductors.", "His team\u2019s handling of the crisis convinced Kranz that he was now a full-fledged flight director and, at the press conference at the end of the shift, he featured Aaron as the real hero for saving the fuel cell.\nThe mission made it almost the full eight days.\nKranz was forced to cut it one orbit short during his final shift so the crew wouldn\u2019t fall into a hurricane during reentry.", "If he needed an assist to wind down, he could go to the doctors for a double shot of

medical scissors to the lanyard.", "In the meantime, Ed White was preparing for his EVA.\nThis would mean exposing the entire interior of the spacecraft to vacuum.\nThere would be nothing between the astronauts and instant death but their thin space suits and helmets.\nThe team decided to give him an extra orbit to get through his checklist.\nNo one knew what to expect.\nDeke Slayton had told

trouble.\nTheir disparaging comments would turn out to be accurate.", "Finally, the countdown resumed and reached zero at 9:34 am Eastern standard time.\nKranz was so excited that, when he left his station to go over to the Teletype machine, he forgot to remove his headset.\nThe cord snagged a chair and knocked it over.\nHe picked it up just as Shepard made his thirty-second report.\nThe Freedom 7 reached an apogee of 116 miles and Shepard tested roll, pitch and yaw manuevers as planned.\nThis assured the doctors whom Kranz considered too conservative that humans could function in space.", "The people in Mission Control wished he had reported it sooner.\nThough the astronauts and NASA medical staff had never gotten along, the flight surgeon could have helped.\nIt certainly didn\u2019t

well.\nThe next day, Schweickart was feeling well enough to try his EVA.\nRetrieving some science packets from outside the LM wore him out and they decided to call off the planned transfer to the command module.\nThey were ready for the real test.", "Kranz considered the plan too risky and had his suspicions about who was behind it.\nBuzz Aldrin was one of the more loudly opinionated astronauts and had picked up the nickname of \u201cDr.\nRendezvous\u201d for his attempts to assist with rendezvous planning.\nHe was in the middle of explaining how the EVA might be done.\nKranz explained to the top players in the room that there was a lot of energy stored up in the shroud\u2019s release mechanism and Cernan would have nothing to latch onto while he worked.\nNewtonian physics applied while in orbit and just using a screwdriver could send him spinning if he had nothing to hold onto.", "We failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked, they must be considered as one spacecraft, one integrated power system, and a single structure.\n\u201cThe next thing is that many of us did not trust the Agena.\nBrooks\u2019s team thought it was a great piece of hardware.\nIf we don\u2019t trust a spacecraft, we have to fix it.\nWe were lucky, too damned lucky, and we must never forget this mission\u2019s lessons.\u201d They were all lessons that would serve them well during the Apollo 13 crisis.\nFor the moment, they made the necessary changes and went forward into preparations for Gemini 9.", "NAA took the EOR side, which would give them full control of manufacturing the spacecraft.\nNorth American turned out a spacecraft that was so riddled with problems that Gus Grissom hung a lemon on it.\nPerhaps someone should have taken the hint.\nThe \u201cplugs-out\u201d test scheduled for January 27, 1967, was considered to be low-risk.\nThe crew were in their pressure suits, in a one hundred percent oxygen atmosphere, and locked in with a newly redesigned hatch that would not blow off by accident.\nThe crew were Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom, Gemini 4 Spacewalker Ed White and a rookie astronaut named Roger Chaffee.", "For all his inventive simulations, there was one \u201cgotcha\u201d that he wasn\u2019t responsible for.\nSomebody got the idea that the man in charge of Hawaii, named Ed Fendell, could fake a heart attack during training.\nThe goal was to see if the backup team were capable of jumping in if something happened to him.\nDuring the final dress rehearsal for network simulation, Fendell crumpled in a heap as planned.\nIt was such a convincing act that the rest of the Hawaii team were momentarily distracted.", "At 1:00 pm, they were sealed into the spacecraft.\nKranz volunteered to lead the MCC team participating in this test and was in his office before sunrise.\nThe Apollo program director had been complaining about the MCC\u2019s readiness and especially their computer systems, so Kraft sent a memo to Kranz telling him to get his systems people to quit their \u201cgold-plating\u201d and justify their requirements.\nKranz sent back a quick acknowledgement and went to get the MCC ready.\nControllers started to arrive for the test at about 11:00 a.m.\nThey were all sick of the amount of testing by this point and John Hodge griped to Kranz, \u201cI sure hope things go well today.", "Deke Slayton was in town, too, and received word that Conrad and Hunter had gotten into a heated argument over who was in charge.\nHunter had threatened to kick Conrad out of the station for butting into his turf and the hapless station crew sent a message asking for clarification about whose orders they should follow.\nHe went straight to the apartment where Kranz and Kraft were staying.\nThey had fallen asleep, but the banging on the door woke them right up.\nSlayton shouted, \u201cChris, we got a problem!\u201d Kranz threw on some clothes and, by the time he got out there, Kraft and Slayton were about ready to duke it out.\n\u201cDammit, Chris, get your guy under control!\u201d snarled Slayton.", "If that thing came off with Cernan nearby, they stood a chance of losing one astronaut.\nNASA didn\u2019t need that kind of poor publicity.\nHe was overridden and, even worse, Chris Kraft had done nothing to back him up.\nFurious, Kranz threatened to quit after the mission was over.\nKraft shrugged it off and ordered him to get the job done.\nHowever, Kranz still had one trump card.\nNo one could override a flight director when he was directing a mission in real time.\nIf it seemed like Cernan was having any kind of trouble, Kranz would wave him off.\nEven so, he spent a sleepless night going over possibilities.", "Cliff Charlesworth\u2019s Green Team got the crew on their way at 7:51 EST on December 21.\nLike many of the Gemini controllers had been, some of the members of his team were fresh out of college and Llewellyn couldn\u2019t resist playing a joke on one of them.\nOne of the youngsters asked about a controller who had visited the coffee station ahead of them.", "Harlan had exactly two worries at this point.\nNobody particularly liked the Gemini ejection system, so he did not want to call an abort when one wasn\u2019t necessary.\nNeither did he want to call an abort too late and risk losing a crew in a fireball.\nThe clock reached zero and the engines lit with the usual rumble intense enough to be felt inside the Gemini.\nThen, everything went quiet.\nFor an instant, Harlan wondered if they were having a repeat of \u201cKaputnik,\u201d an early American answer to Sputnik that had been lost in a launchpad explosion, with two crewmen inside.", "Kranz worked by feel and the mission came off reasonably well for the fact that they weren\u2019t really prepared for a power failure in the control center.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston adapted its electrical systems so that wouldn\u2019t happen in the future and camera crews were required to provide their own power when covering future space missions.\nTug Of War Even though everybody in NASA had the same goal of going to the Moon, there were frequent disagreements about how to get there and who was in charge of what.\nMission Control got into a tug-of-war with the astronaut office over who, exactly, was in charge of the remote stations.", "Training started eight weeks before the planned launch date.\nThey ran through the planned mission for the first couple of days to identify major Go/NoGo points and get a feel for what a \u201cnormal\u201d mission with no problems would be.\nA new SimSup named Dick Koos continued the tradition of imaginative simulation scripts that helped the control team refine procedures and mission rules.\nNot everything went perfectly.\nThe crew and controllers often trained together and that meant the computer network between the control room and crew simulators needed to stay up and running.\nWhen it didn\u2019t, SimSup had to contend with impatient astronauts and controllers while technicians tried to troubleshoot.", "\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been benched.\u201d Von Ehrenfried filled in as assistant flight director and did fine.\nJust before Cooper\u2019s flight, he got a local hospital to provide an electrocardiogram of somebody having a heart attack, fed it into the simulation, and stood back and laughed up his sleeve while the physicians tried to figure it out.\nThat taught the physicians that an astronaut might not have time for doctors to argue over the diagnosis.\nBrooks became notorious for his challenging simulations.\nKranz\u2019s family was still growing.\nMarta gave birth to their fourth child, a boy, and the residents of Flight Controller Alley ganged up on Kranz to send him to her side while she was in labor.", "When they regained contact, Armstrong and Scott were rolling at a rate of one complete rotation per second.\nAt that rate, they risked blacking out.\nThe roll had started when they were still docked to the Agena and they had undocked, thinking something had gone wrong with the automated spacecraft.\nAs it turned out, one of their own thrusters was stuck open.\nArmstrong drained the orbital fuel trying to get the Gemini back under control and had to fire the reentry thrusters to stop the roll.\nThey would have to come back home.", "Either way, the launch was successful that day.\nThe crew rendezvoused with the ATDA on the third orbit and confirmed Mission Control\u2019s suspicions about the shroud.\nIt was only partly open and held in place by a band.\n\u201cIt looks like an angry alligator,\u201d reported Stafford.\nMission Control sent several rapid maneuver commands in an attempt to jettison the shroud with no luck.\nIn the meantime, the Gemini left the Agena, orbited Earth one more time, and returned for a second rendezvous.", "Somebody had cancelled the post-shift press conference, leaving him free to return to his quarters at MCC.\nAs a result, he missed seeing how steady astronauts could be when things went wrong but heard all about it later.\nNo Lift-Off The computing team responsible for planning the rendezvous were real heroes for working with calculators and computers that were cutting-edge at the time but only one step up from slide rules.\nTheir numbers indicated that, if Gemini 6 launched at 8:54 a.m. CST on December 12, 1965, they could perform the maneuvers necessary for the rendezvous.", "NASA procedure also called for nearly all communications between the crew and the ground to be available to the press.\nTo allow for limited private communications, Mission Control worked out a workaround code called UHF-6.\nIf either the ground or the crew requested a UHF-6 test, a private loop would be set up with a surgeon in the back room and the surgeon would privately brief the flight director afterwards.\nThe press was typically nosy, however, and Kranz tried to give them a runaround with highly technical jargon about communications and antenna.\nThat failed and he was forced to admit defeat.\nWith the Gemini 6 launch coming up, all the controllers were pulling exhausting double shifts.", "It took some doing, but the flight directors did their best to keep their cool with the crew and keep their flight teams on track.\nEven so, it took its toll and Lunney vented his frustration to Kranz during the last handover, \u201cI have finally had enough of this crew.\u201d Schirra got his way on the helmet issue and his crew made it down on schedule.\nIt was Schirra\u2019s third and last space flight and Eisele and Cunningham never flew in space again.\nLunney received a well-deserved medal for his efforts.\nKranz never found out why Schirra had been so bad-tempered and, after leaving NASA, Schirra went back to his normal funny self.", "Gemini 8 was only half an orbit from rendezvousing with the Agena when the CapCom on Rose Knot reported that they had lost the automatic data comparison on the Agena.\nThe Agena systems engineer tried to rerun it, and then began printing out the memory data for the manual check.\nThe echo check looked okay, so Gemini 8 approached the Agena as planned, Rose Knot gave everything one last check, and the controllers gave the Go for docking.", "The problem was in the way the astronauts were being trained and the rocketmeisters in Huntsville, Alabama, solved it with a water tank where astronauts could practice EVA activity.\nGemini 9 came home safely and Gene Kranz moved over to Apollo.\nHe missed being a flight director for Gemini 10, 11 and 12 but had plenty of work to do.\nHe found a program full with problems.\nApollo 1 For all the problems that the Mercury and Gemini missions had thrown at them, NASA hadn\u2019t yet lost astronauts during a mission.\nNASA personnel were starting to get overconfident and NASA senior staff had decided to go with a new contractor called North American Aviation to build the Apollo spacecraft.", "Things went smoothly at first, with Cooper ticking off his experiments on schedule and the shift change occurring on schedule as Faith 7 was progressing along its sixth orbit.\nHodge had a different approach to mission control than Kraft did.\nKraft was a very hands-on mentor of the young mission controllers and comfortable with his status as team leader.\nHodge tried to obtain a consensus before making a decision, was good with people but didn\u2019t seem quite so comfortable with his leadership role.\nKranz remembered him as a nice guy.", "Many of these new people were brand-new graduates from colleges around Texas.\nA basic training course for flight controllers was set up.\nThe first class of six spent two weeksworth of twelve-hour days learning learning Morse code and speed printing.\nKranz handed out their flight controllerscertificates himself, and then the first class went out to the remote sites.\nA few of the controllers posted in unfriendly territories like Zanzibar had military experience that served them well when they ran across such obstacles as burning roadblocks and hostile natives.", "The Americans scored their second space first when Armstrong reported, \u201cWe\u2019re docked, no noticeable oscillations, very smooth.\u201d Everything seemed to be going well, though CapCom Jim Lovell decided that Armstrong and Scott should be informed of the failed load comparison.\nA military coup in Zanzibar had forced NASA to move the remote station over to Madagascar and Gemini 8 was making a pass over it when Lovell told them, \u201cIf the Agena attitude control system goes wild, just send the command to turn it off and take control of the spacecraft.\u201d Everything looked normal when Gemini 8 flew into a zone of no coverage.", "He hung his white vest on a hook, his thoughts racing ahead to the news conference he now had to face.\nThough NASA\u2019s public-relations officers were not universally popular and often hated by the astronauts, Gene Kranz thought they really earned their pay when dealing with the press conferences.\nThis press conference did cause one lingering misconception about Kranz.\nThe blurbs about the flight directors in the press release said he looked like a poster boy for the Marines.\nThe press ate that one up and, from then on, Kranz felt like he was forever explaining that he was Air Force, not Marines.\nHe found a place at MCC to sleep until the end of the mission.", "The walls of the LM were so thin that a good poke with a pencil would have punched a hole right through them.\nThey wouldn\u2019t have worked in an atmosphere and were so ungainly-looking that the astronauts called the training version \u201cflying bedsteads.\u201d It was a good chance to try out a few new controllers who had come on board since Gemini.\nKranz would need them.\nThree days before the launch, LM control engineer got into a traffic accident on his way to work.\nWhile he was still able to cover the actual launch, he was unable to move his upper body and could only communicate with the help of fellow controller Bob Carlton.\nThe launch went smoothly, and then they ran into two alarms at once.", "Gene Kranz summed it up at the debriefing.\n\u201cWe got our crew home safely and the control teams did a damn fine job under real-time pressure.\nI know this is going to sound like Monday morning quarterbacking, but the lessons from the mission are how we screwed up in planning and training.\n\u201cThe crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong.", "Gene Kranz could only think: \u201cWell, let them get on with their great plans.\nI\u2019m gonna put a man in orbit first.\u201d The second suborbital, Liberty Bell 7 manned by Gus Grissom, was nearly a carbon copy of Freedom 7, though the capsule sank and Grissom nearly drowned.\nThe helicopter crews seemed more worried about retrieving the capsule than rescuing Grissom.\nKranz growled to his console, \u201cForget the capsule, just get Gus.\u201d Grissom barely made it out of there by grabbing a line from one of the helicopters.", "Kranz expected a normal handover routine in which they would go over any outstanding issues.\nKraft was eager to get to the press conference and abruptly put his headset away.\nKranz didn\u2019t know if he had a plan.\n\u201cChris, what do you want to do?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the flight director; it\u2019s your shift.\nMake up your own mind.\u201d Kraft was handing him another test.\nGemini 5 was going to fly through a zone of poor coverage in the ground network and Kranz had an important Go/NoGo decision to make.", "For all that the other flight directors teased him about it, none of them could deny that they were tense today, as well.\nChris Kraft was sitting at the back of the room and kept asking Charlesworth about the status of the countdown.\nCharlesworth finally threatened to have him kicked out of the control room if he didn\u2019t cool it.\nThis was one of the few times when a flight director could talk back to his boss and Kraft desisted.\nAt first, the launch could have been just another simulation if it wasn\u2019t for the presence of luminaries like Bob Gilruth and the MCC\u2019s in-house PR representative, Jack Riley.", "Having to walk on site will maybe put a dent in his thick skull.\u201d Kranz doubted it and Llewellyn proved him right when he showed up with his own horse the very next day.\nWhenever Gemini 7 flew into gaps in ground coverage, Kranz drilled his team in the fine art of handling two flights at once.\nIt was a nightmare for the CapComs and the computer people, who had to learn how to switch between the programs for each mission in an instant.\nOne little glitch could bring the computer system down.\nEarly in the morning of December 12, 1965, Kranz\u2019s team was exhausted but ready when they handed things over to Hodge\u2019s Blue Team.", "They had nailed six tough simulations, boosting their confidence.\nThe 12 prime crew switched places with their backup crew.\nThis would be the final simulation before Launch Day and Kranz\u2019s mind was already on the bits of business he had to take care of before the launch.\nIt turned out to be a mistake.\nSimSup had \u201cCase Number 26\u201d loaded into the simulation computers and told his men, \u201cOK, gang, let\u2019s see how much they know about program alarms.\u201d The GUIDO, Steve Bales, spotted a 1201 alarm on his readouts.\nHe had to look it up in an index file.", "Kranz enjoyed the early-morning silence and the searchlights in the distance assured him that the countdown was still running.\nEverything was on schedule when he arrived.\nKranz checked out communications on his and Kraft\u2019s console.\nKraft greeted him with his usual, \u201cHow\u2019s it going, young man?\u201d and Kranz responded with a thumbs-up.\nThen, Kraft was distracted by some issues with the worldwide data network and Kranz moved on.", "The team\u2019s performance went downhill from there.\nIt got so bad that Chris Kraft gave Kranz a call.\n\u201cI listened to your runs today.\nSounds like you had a tough time.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kranz assured his boss that his team was only having a bad day and would get through it with more training and revisions of the mission rules.\nThings did improve for a while.", "Simulated missions were one thing the mission controllers had in common with the astronauts.\nBrooks would throw every imaginable scenario at them to see how they handled it.\nOne time, the simulation supervisor (SimSup) decided Kraft was depending too much on Kranz and pulled him off.\n\u201cKranz had an accident on the way to MCC and is in the hospital,\u201d SimSup told Kraft.\nKranz protested, \u201cWhat are you doing?\nWe have a mission to prepare for!\u201d Kraft was amused.", "The comrades in Mission Control celebrated with a big bash that night.\nMission Control\u2019s transfer to Houston was getting into high gear and Kranz sent out one of Control\u2019s new recruits, Manfred \u201cDutch\u201d Von Ehrenfried, as a real estate scout.\nKranz\u2019s only conditions were that the housing be affordable and that the down payment not be more than $250.\nThe part of Houston that Von Ehrenfried found for them came to be known as Flight Controller Alley.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) was also growing in size, from 750 to 1800 employees in three months.", "There was a chance that Kranz would have to step into Kraft\u2019s place for the launch and he was so nervous that he clipped out a Sports Illustrated picture of a woman in a swimsuit for emotional support.\nKraft recovered enough to cover the actual launch and Kranz stepped back to his original role of insuring that the control teams and data network were ready.\nIt was one of the few unmanned shots covered by reporters in the control room and Kranz thought it was a bit much for an unmanned suborbital shot that had become nearly routine in the Mercury days.\nThere were so many cameras in the room that a fuse blew, plunging them into darkness.\nThis was where blindfold drills came in handy.", "We are the cause!\nWe were not ready!\nWe did not do our job!\nWe were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when we knew in our hearts it would take a miracle.\nWe were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did.", "So they pulled out a new backup rendezvous vehicle called the augmented target docking adopter (ATDA), the mission was renamed Gemini 9A for the sake of bureaucracy and they scheduled the next launch attempt for June 1.\nThe ATDA launch went well but the controller for this new automated spacecraft reported that it was guzzling fuel and the adapter shroud might not have opened fully.\nA command shut down the ATDA\u2019s attitude control jets.\nIf the shroud hadn\u2019t opened fully, they might not be able to dock but that was a secondary objective.\nA failure in the ground support equipment forced them to scrub the Gemini launch for two days.", "Riley kept up a running commentary for the benefit of reporters outside the control room and, when Kranz overheard him saying something about \u201clunar landing mission,\u201d it sank in.\nThey were finally going the rest of the way and only Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins had better seats than the people in the control room.\nCharlesworth stayed on duty until after the trans-lunar injection, and then Kranz took over.\nThe crew went into their first sleep cycle during Kranz\u2019s shift and his team only had to keep track of any funnies.\nHe made notes and everything went smoothly for the next few shift rota", "If things got too bad, Slayton and Kraft could get involved and things tended to snowball when training for subsequent missions got pushed back.\nSixteen-hour days were not uncommon.\nWhen the computer system did work, they nailed sim after sim until Koos decided that Kranz\u2019s team was beginning to get too overconfident and ratcheted up the pressure.\nKranz\u2019s team would remember June 10th as a killer.\nThey nailed the first few scenarios, but they turned out to be just warm-up rounds.\nOn the fourth run, the Trench allowed the LM\u2019s speed to build up too fast, resulting in a crash.\nOn the fifth, a combination of an electrical problem and a primary computer failure killed the crew.", "Launch day started even earlier for Gene Kranz than for Alan Shepard.\nHe left the hotel shortly after midnight, carpooling with MCC RETRO Carl Huss.\nHussappearance and habits reminded many of his colleagues of a bear and, like a bear coming out hibernation, he was slow to wake up.", "Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White and Chaffee.\nThese words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.\u201d The official investigation would reveal that the fire had started somewhere near Gus Grissom\u2019s seat.\nThere was some speculation that Grissom could have done something to cause the fire, which the controllers and engineers who were most involved in the project thought was pure nonsense.\nThe fire had started in an area that Grissom couldn\u2019t reach from his seat, even by accident.", "When he found out the truth, he chalked it up to the fact that if you asked enough experts, you would eventually find one nay-sayer.\nSlayton took charge of the astronaut corps, an important job that must have felt like a consolation prize.\nCarpenter swung right into preparations and named his spacecraft the Aurora 7.\nThe flight date was changed to give him more time for training.\nThe Friendship 7 had proven the value of having a man in control of the spacecraft and they hoped to expand on it with Aurora 7.\nThe plan also included observations of the spectacular sunsets and sunrises that John Glenn has reported, as well as Earth and space.", "I\u2019m looking to get a lot of experience on this flight.\u201d Glenn\u2019s response was a little sarcastic: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get it.\u201d Glenn gave the countdown for the retrofire.\nCooper made a nearly flawless reentry and, when complimented on a job well done, drawled in his Oklahoman accent, \u201cAw, shucks, we aim to please.\u201d The Gemini Project had the goals of developing many of the techniques and technologies needed to get to the Moon.\nGemini demonstrated extra-vehicular activity (EVA), rendezvous and docking techniques and man\u2019s ability to function in space for mission durations of up to two weeks.", "To cover it, Mercury Control operated in two shifts for the first time.\nJohn Hodge became flight director for the second shift and Kranz was assigned to his team as assistant flight director.\nKranz had forgiven Cooper for the wild car ride on his first day of work and liked him for his fun-loving spirit.\nHowever, Cooper was not universally popular.\nA few people were hesitant about his Oklahoman accent, which made him sound like a back-waters country boy, and he nearly got yanked from the mission when he rattled nerves by buzzing the control center in a T-38.\nThe launch went off as planned at 8:04 AM EST.", "They would hold blindfold drills in which they reached for each switch until they could almost have flown the thing themselves.\nThe art of flight control was continuing to be refined and the control team spent many hours studying schematics and writing flight procedures and mission rules.\nKraft made one change in the job description of the flight director.\nThe description now said: \u201cThe flight director may, after analysis of a flight, take any action necessary for mission success.\u201d This cleared up some vague terms in the previous job description and gave the flight director more leeway in directing the missions.", "A new influx of college graduates were brought in to maintain the new technology and bring the control team up to speed.\nKranz had only limited experience with computers and had to scramble to catch up.\nThe residents of Flight Controller Alley spent almost two years preparing for the first Gemini launch and became a close-knit bunch in the process.\nOne of Kranz\u2019s contribution was a mock-up of a Gemini cockpit.\nHe wanted his team to become nearly as familiar with the spacecraft\u2019s controls as the astronauts would be."]
