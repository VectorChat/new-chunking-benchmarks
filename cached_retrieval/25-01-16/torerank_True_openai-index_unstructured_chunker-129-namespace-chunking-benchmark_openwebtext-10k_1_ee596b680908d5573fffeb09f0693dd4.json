we summarize Bob's optimal strategy below.\nAnd then we'll illustrate each strategy step thoroughly when we apply the theory to Alice's EP and CO openraises.We summarize everything we have learned about Bob's optimal strategy for 3-betting and 5-betting:For example, if Alice raises 15% from the UTG, her optimal value range is {QQ+, AK} as shown previously.\nBob chooses value hands that are at least 50% against this range, and his pure value range becomes {KK+}.\nThen he adds Axs hands as 5-bet bluffs until Alice's weakest value hands (QQ and AK) are break even against his total 5-bet range.Alice then calls her remaining 73 BB to win a 189.5 bb pot (1.5 from the blinds, 100 from Bob, 27 from Alice's 4-bet), so her pot odds are 128.5 : 73.\nShe needs minimum 73(/128.5 + 73) =36% equity to profit from calling, so Bob makes sure her weakest value hands have against his 5-bet-range.\nLater in the article we'll show that Bob ends up with a total 5-bet range of {KK+, A5s, A4s} when Alice's value range is {QQ+, AK}This gives Bob {KK+, A5s, A4s} =20 value combos that he 3-bets, planning to 5-bet all-in.\nThen he picks hands to 3-bet bluff until he has a 40/60 ratio between value combos and bluff combos.\nBob needs 60/40 =1.5 bluff combos for every value combo, so he will choose 1.5 x 20 =30 bluff combos against Alice's {QQ+, AK} value range.You should memorize both Alice's strategy and Bob's strategy until you know them cold.\nIt's not really complicated at all.\nJust remember that Bob uses a", "bet 30% of her opening range", "A2s+ A9o+ K9s+ KTo+ Q9s+ QTo+",

plan to raise and reraise until we are all-in.\nBluff hands are hands we plan to fold if our opponent reraises us back.We now begin the job of constructing optimal strategy pairs for Alice and Bob.\nFirst when Alice raises a 15% range from EP, and then when she raises a 25% range from CO. We'll do this thoroughly and methodically, so that you can learn the procedures inside out.\nI hope you'll see that these strategies aren't really complicated to construct and then apply at the table.We'll now find the optimal strategy pair for Alice and Bob when Alice open-raises from early position (EP =UTG or MP), and it's folded to Bob in position.It's of course possible to vary EP opening ranges a lot, according to opponent tendencies and general game conditions.\nBut the core strategy for a typical TAG is to open somewhere around 15% of his hands (plus/minus a couple of percentage points in both directions) from both EP positions, and slightly tighter from UTG than from MP.We'll construct all strategies/ranges with great detail for this scenario, so that there won't be any doubt about how to apply the theory.\nThen we'll move on to the scenario with Alice in CO, and do this quickly, with brief comments along the way.We assume Alice is opening with a ~15% EP range.\nNote that any 15'ish% EP-range will do, since our work is based on the numbers of hands in the range, and not the specific hands it contains.\nObvious value hands like high", "The raiser opens some range", "Bob's 3", "K9o,Q9s Q6s,QJo Q9o}", "30% of her opening range, and she will 4-bet a mix of value hands (planning to call a 5-bet) and bluffs (planing to fold to a 5-bet).\nWe'll compute Alice's optimal value/bluff ratio in a moment, but first we have to find Bob's optimal ranges for 3-betting and 5-betting.\nThese ranges follow from Alice's opening range:When Alice 4-bets to 27bb, she is risking 23.5bb (27bb minus he 3.5bb raise) more to win a 17bb pot (1.5bb from the blinds + Alice's 3.5bb raise + Bob's 12bb 3-bet).\nThe effective pot odds for Alice's 4-bet bluffs are 17 : 23.5, and she can make a profit by 4-bet bluffing any two (of the hands she open-raised) if Bob folds his 3-betting hands more than 23.5/(23.5 + 17) =58%.Bob can't allow Alice to 4-bet bluff any two cards profitably, so he defends optimally by folding exactly 58% of the time, and 5-betting all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs as we shall soon see) 42% of the time.\nTherefore, 42% of Bob's 3-bets need to be value hands that he plans to 5-bet all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs).\nWe now define aas a 3-bet where we plan to 5-bet all-in after a 4-bet.\nIf this is not our plan, we are making athat we will fold to a 4-bet.To make these percentages easy to remember, we round Bob's optimal 3-bet value/bluff ratio to 40/60.\nSo now we know that 60% of Bob's 3-bets should be bluffs, and 40% should be for value (including some 5-bet bluffs).\nBut we still don't know how many hands Bob should 3-bet overall.\nTo find this number, we first have to find which hands Bob can 5-bet for value.Bob first chooses the type of hands to 5-bet bluff with.\nHe wants hands that", "Both players operate with wide ranges, and all ranges have a significant percentage of bluffs in them, especially at the early stage (raising and 3-betting) Both players are willing to fold most of their bluffs (but not all of them), when their opponent reraises them back", "raises some opening range", "1.1 Presenting the problem", "bet them", "bet/call 5 bet", "Against an opponent who makes the dual mistake of not 4-betting bluffing enough, and also paying off our value 5-bets too much, Bob can gain a lot from not having to think about 5-bet bluffing.\nBob simply 3-bets {KK+} for value, plus a wide range of 3-bet bluffs, and after a 4-bet he 5-bets {KK+} for value and folds everything else.\nThis way Bob exploits Villains lack of 4-bet bluffing, since his 3-bet bluffs forces Villain to fold most of his non-value hands (since Villain is unwilling to 4-bet bluff with these hands).\nAnd Bob also doesn't need to attack Villain's 4-bet bluffs with 5-bet bluffs of his own, since Villain isn't 4-bet bluffing.\nFinally, Bob exploits Villain's static 5-bet-calling range by only 5-betting for value (and getting called as a big favorite), and not having to include 5-bet bluffs for deception.\nEasy game.\nAt any rate, Bob's final value 3-bet range (including his 5-bet bluffs) against Alice's optimally played ~15% EP range is {KK+, A5s, A4s}.\nBob's last job is to construct the 3-bet bluff range.\nThese are the hands we 3-bet, and always fold to a 4-bet.", "A classic opponent mistake at the low

small deviations don't change things dramatically.\nFor example, when you know the strategy pair corresponding to a 15% opening range, you can apply the same strategies against a 12% raiser and an 18%

bluffs that he folds to a 4-bet.\nWe'll now find Bob's 5-bet bluffing hands, then his 3-bet bluffing range, and then we are done.", "This results in a total 3-bet range of 3.2 + 4.6 =7.8% against Alice's ~25% CO range.\nThe value/bluff ratio, using our numerical rounding, is 42/61, which is very close to the optimal 40/60.\nWhen Alice moves from EP to CO and her opening range changes from ~15% to ~25%, Bob responds by loosening up his 3-betting range dramatically.\nThis is an interesting observation.\nThose of you who use a more or less static 3-betting range (for example, the generic {JJ+, AQ} without any 3-bet bluffing that is recommended on many low limit forums) now have game theoretical \"proof\" that we can get away with a lot of 3-bet bluffing on the button against a CO raiser.\nEven against a TAG CO raiser with a solid ~25% opening range, you can 3-bet almost 8% on the button and there isn't anything he can do to exploit your loose 3-bets.\nAnd if he defends poorly, for example by not 4-bet-bluffing enough, or not being willing to use JJ/AQ as value hands, you can deviate from optimal play and attack him even harder.\nThe first adjustment against a weak/passive CO raiser who folds a lot to 3-bets is to increase your fixed 3-bet bluff percentage for the candidate list.\nYou might increase the bluff candidate 3-betting frequency from 40% to 60%.\nIf Villain (and the blinds) doesn't adjust to your exploitative, loose 3-betting, you'll be printing money.", "So we 4-bet bluff all non-value hands 15% of the time and fold them the remaining 85% of the

you will of course also be able to design optimal strategy pairs to use against specific opponents (not on the fly, but by doing a bit of analysis work between sessions).We use the following scenario:Note that Alice doesn't defend against 3-bets by calling out of position.\nWeconceivably design a defense strategy where we fold weak hands, 4-bet strong hands, and call with medium hands, but this is not a good strategy out of position with 100bb stacks.You have poor implied odds (due to low stack/pot ratio and being out of position) when you call for postflop value with implied odds hands.\nAnd it's difficult to steal and outplay Villain when you are out of position.\nAnd what you absolutely cannot do, is to call and then play fit-or-fold postflop.\nIt will be much more fold than fit, and you are simply burning money by letting Villain c-bet his way to riches and early retirement on your expense.With regard to Alice's choice of 4-bet size, it's standard to use 25-30bb (where full pot would be 37.5bb) with 100bb stacks.\nThe logic behind this is that with 100bb stacks, we are putting Villain in a shove-or-fold scenario, also when we 4-bet a bit less than pot.\nHis 3-bet bluffs will still fold, and his strong hands will still shove.\nSo we win the same when he folds, but lose less on our bluffs when he doesn't fold.\nIn other words: We risk less for the same reward when we're bluffing, and we don't lose anything when we're 4-betting", "As mentioned previously, there are two techniques Bob can use:", "Example 1.1.1: We get 3-bet out of position", "in our

an opponentif he had played optimally, we can conclude that he has a weakness in his game if he chooses to do something different.\nAnd we might be able to exploit these weaknesses and turn them into leaks for him.Before we get started, I want to give credit to Cardrunners instructor Matthew Janda.\nDuring the spring of 2010 he published a 3-part video seriesat Stoxpoker, which contains most of the theory we use in this article.\nThis video series was inspiring and eye-opening, but sadly it became unavailable after Stoxpoker shut down in May 2010.Matt Janda is now a Cardrunners instructor, and he continues to produce game theory related videos.\nHis old videos from Stoxpoker might get moved over to Cardrunners, and if that happens, I recommend you check them out.Without further ado, let's get started:I have chosen an approach where we first go through the necessary math and theory quickly, and then we apply it by constructing optimal strategy pairs for two scenarios:- The raiser in early position (UTG or MP) with a 15% opening range- The raiser in CO with a 25% opening rangeLumping UTG and MP together under the label \"EP\" makes sense, since most players use very similar ranges for these two positions.\nThe percentages we have chosen for EP and CO are typical TAG ranges that can be used under all game conditions.The exact ranges we use to illustrate the procedures aren't", "Hero ($200) raises to $7 with This is getting frustrating.\nHero has a decent hand, but it's not strong enough to defend against a 3-bet from out of position, so Hero folds.\nBut he is

paying off Bob's value 5-bets with {KK+}.\nIf she tries to be \"smart\" and fold QQ/AK, Bob will just collect his profit with his 5-bet bluffs instead.\nSo Bob's 5-bet bluffs with some Axs hands attack Alice's 4-bet bluffs, and they also make it impossible for her to profitably tighten up her value range, even if she knows Bob's value range is the squeaky tight {KK+}.\nKeep in mind that Alice knows Bob's strategy, since this follows from her own strategy, which follows from her opening range, which both players know.\nSo she knows Bob only 3-bets/5-bets {KK+} for pure value, and if Bob's doesn't 5-bet bluff a bit, Alice can improve her 5-bet-calling strategy by folding the big underdog's QQ/AK from her value range {QQ+, AK}.\nAnd when one of the players can improve his/her EV by a strategy change, the original strategy pair can't be optimal (per definition).\nSo Bob has to 5-bet bluff.\nThe next step for Bob is to add enough Axs to make Alice's weakest value hands break even when they call a 5-bet.\nAlice then calls off her last 73bb to win the blinds + Alice's 4-bet + Bob's stack =1.5 + 27 + 100 =128.5 bb.\nThe pot odds are 128.5 : 73 =1.76 : 1, so Alice needs minimum

and AK are barely above the threshold, while all weaker hands will be big underdogs.\nThus, Bob's pure value range is {QQ+, AK}, and he happily 3-bets these hands, and then 5-bets them all-in, purely for value.\nWe add 5-bet bluffs to Bob's value range", "Flop: Hero ($176) checks, button ($176) bets $30, Hero folds.", "Her 4", "Alice is sitting with a 100bb stack in EP or CO, and she raises pot to

"Example 1.1.2: We get 3-bet out of position (again)", "value/bluff ratio.\nWe'll summarize Alice's total optimal strategy below, but first we'll find out how often Bob should 3-bet.We know which type of hands Bob should 5-bet bluff (Axs), and we know he should use a 40/60 value/bluff ratio (which, coincidentally is the opposite of the ratio for Alice's 4-bet range).\nThe last piece of information we need is Bob's3-bet percentage in an optimal 3-betting strategy.\nWe find the answer by observing that Bob should 5-bet bluff enough to make Alice's weakest value hands break even.\nHe he bluffs more, Alice can gain by calling with more hands, and then Bob's strategy can't be optimal.\nAnd if he bluffs less, Alice can gain by folding more hands, and Bob's strategy can't be optimal in this case either.How many Axs hands we need to make Alice's weakest 5-bet calling hands break even varies with Alice's value range (60% of 30% of her opening range), which follows from her opening range.\nSo we have to compute this result on a per-case basis, for every one of Alice's opening ranges.\nWe'll give a quick example in the summary below, and the procedure will be thoroughly discussed later in the article.We summarize everything we have learned about Alice's optimal strategy for raising, 4-betting and calling 5-bets:- She needs to 4-bet 30% of her opening range- Her 4-betting range should have a 60/40 value/bluff ratioSo Alice's optimal strategy is:So Alice's value hands are the top 18% of her opening range.\nFor example, if she opens 15% from UTG, this corresponds to a value range of 0.18 x 0.15 =2.7% of all hands.\nThis makes up 0.027 x 1326 =36", "Moving QQ/AK from the flatting range up to the value range against a ~15% opening range is a bit like moving a defender forward and using him as a striker.\nSure, he might score a goal or two, but he isn't quite good enough for the job.\nBut he is too good to sit on the bench, so he should play.\nTherefore, since there is another job for which he is well qualified (defending), we let him play there.\nThe right man for the right job.\nBob will therefore flat QQ, AK and various other medium strong hands/implied odds hands after a ~15% open-raise from Alice.\nThe optimal flatting range depends on how Bob thinks Alice plays postflop, what he thinks the players in the blinds will do, how they play postflop, their stack sizes, etc.\nSo we leave the construction of an optimal flatting range to Bob.\nNote that 3-betting QQ and AK for value against a ~15% EP raiser is equivalent to assuming the raiser isn't playing optimally.\nIf you feel these two hands can always be 3-bet and 5-bet all-in for value against this EP range, you can assume it's because the players you meet don't defend well against 3-bets out of position."]
