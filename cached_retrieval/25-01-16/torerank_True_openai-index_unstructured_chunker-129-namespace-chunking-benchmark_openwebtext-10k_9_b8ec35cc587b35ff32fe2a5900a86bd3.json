J.\n2008.\nThe paradox of metaphor: Why we need a three-dimensional model for metaphor.\nMetaphor and Symbol, 23(4): 213\u2013241. )\nterms, may be described as a case of deliberate metaphor.\nIn addition, the local metaphorical pattern provides enough detail to", "Overall, Frances's multimodal metaphorical description of her pain has the potential to facilitate a rich and intense simulation including multiple sensory, proprioceptive and introspective simulators.\nThe extract contains a variety of lexical choices that can activate sensory simulators for the colour, size, shape and feel of specific physical objects (\u201cred hot swords,\u201d \u201cone rod\u201d), as well as proprioceptive simulators for the intense physical sensations that would result from repeated penetration and burning via a large number of incandescent sharp objects.\nThe associated introspective simulators for negative emotions are potentially much more powerful and overwhelming than in the case of the more conventional and less detailed descriptions I have discussed.", "(see Lascaratou, 2007 Lascaratou, C. 2007.\nThe language of pain: Expression or description Amsterdam: John Benjamins.\n, pp.\n164-5).\nThe uses of the adjective sharp in the following extracts from the British National Corpus (hereafter BNC) can help to clarify the interaction between metaphor and metonymy in the description of pain experiences in terms of potential causes of physical damage of (see also Semino, forthcoming Semino, E. forthcoming.\n\u201cMetaphor, creativity, and the experience of pain across genres\u201d.\nIn Creativity, language, literature: The state of the art Edited by: Swann, J., Pope, R. and Carter, R.

a response from another speaker (Oh, don't worry about it!\n), but no other references to pain occur within the part of the interaction that is included in the relevant file in the BNC.\nAs I mentioned earlier, there is ample evidence of the conventionality of the metaphorical use of sharp to describe non-nociceptive pain sensations.\nSharp is one of the descriptors for pain that are included in the MPQ.\nIn the BNC, sharp is the 25th most frequent collocate of pain: it occurs 26 times immediately before the word pain.\n21 of these occurrences are metaphorical as in example (6) above, amounting to approximately 4.5 occurrences out of 1,000 citations of sharp.\nThis far exceeds the threshold suggested by Deignan (2005 Deignan, A.\n2005.\nMetaphor and corpus linguistics,

that is found less than once in every thousand citations can be considered either innovative or rare(Deignan, 2005 Deignan, A.\n2005.\nMetaphor and corpus linguistics, Amsterdam: John Benjamins.\n, p. 40).\nIn addition, the entry for sharp in the Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners (which is based on a different corpus of contemporary English) includes, amongst others, a meaning of the adjective that is explained as follows: \u201ca sharp pain is sudden and severe\u201d.\nThe adjective also has a range of other similarly frequent metaphorical uses, some of which can be broadly related to the use I am", "On the basis of the metaphor identification procedure proposed in Pragglejaz Group (2007 Group, Pragglejaz.\n2007.\nMIP: A method for identifying metaphorically used words in discourse.\nMetaphor and Symbol 22(1): 1\u201339.\n), extract (1) can be described as involving the most basic meaning of the adjective sharp : a physical property of solid objects that have a very thin edge or a pointed end.\nIn extract (2), the adjective is used to describe the kind of nociceptive pain sensation that arises in response to being cut with an object that has a very thin point (a drawing pin, in this case).\nThis use is best described as metonymic, since it involves a cause-effect association between the basic meaning of sharp and what the Pragglejaz Group call the \u201ccontextual\u201d meaning of the adjective (i.e., the particular kind of pain sensation evoked in the extract).\nIn contrast, the pain experiences described as sharp in extracts (3) and (4) do not arise as responses to injuries inflicted by means of sharp objects.\nThe pain described in (3) is suspected to be caused by damage to the lining of the stomach, while (4) describes a headache that is not associated with any physical damage at all.\nIt can therefore be argued that, in both cases, the contextual meanings (i.e., those particular kinds of pain sensations) are understood via comparison with the basic meaning: pain that does not result from damage inflicted by external entities is described in terms of a property of objects that can cause injuries associated with a widely familiar kind of nociceptive pain.\nAs a consequence, the use of the", "At least three of the words ( ghan-ghan kiri-kiri and chiku-chiku ) are similar to the English expressions discussed in the

(i.e., internal body states such as warmth), and introspective experiences (i.e., cognitive and emotional experiences such as fear).\nRitchie's approach to metaphor relies on a (fuzzy) distinction between \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d simulators associated with words.\nPrimary simulators correspond to the defining characteristics of the relevant concept, while secondary simulators correspond to further, looser associations.\nFor example, the word shark may activate links to other words and phrases (e.g., predator ) and to primary simulators for size, shape, colour, and so on.\nIn addition, the word may activate links to a wider set of", "Most people are also likely to be familiar with the sensation of having a tooth drilled, which, even under local anaesthetic, can produce a powerful and unpleasant physical sensation.\nHence, other things being equal, there is greater potential that the processing of \u201cdrilling pain\u201d in example (7) may involve the basic meaning of the adjective, and the activation of some elements of a scenario in which a tool capable of drilling is applied to someone's body.\nIn Ritchie's terms, this would result in a simulation that could involve (primary) sensory simulators for the shape and feel of a drill, proprioceptive simulators for the sensation of being penetrated by a drill, and introspective simulators for the anxiety and distress that would accompany such a situation.\nWhile such a rich simulation is, in my view, more plausible than in the case of sharp, it needs to be taken into account that the use of drilling in relation to pain is not entirely novel, and that no other linguistic expression in the co-text contributes to the evocation of a scenario involving physical damage.\nIt is therefore possible that the processing of drilling in the extract above may activate a more limited simulation, involving only secondary proprioceptive simulators for unpleasant physical pressure and/or introspective simulators for emotional distress.\nIn both extracts (6) and (7) any simulation triggered by \u201csharp pain\u201d or \u201cdrilling pain\u201d is also likely to be relatively fleeting, as neither description of pain is elaborated in the relevant local (spoken or written) co-text.", "Pain is a basic and essential human experience.\nIn its prototypical form, it occurs as a response to tissue damage, and constitutes a crucial warning mechanism whose function is to prevent harm to our bodies: the pain experienced when coming into contact with a flame, for example, is due to the damage that the flame causes to our skin, and triggers a reaction (instinctively moving away from the flame) that prevents further damage.\nThis kind of pain (known as \u201cnociceptive\u201d pain) contrasts with less prototypical kinds of pain that are not, or not simply, explainable as a response to tissue damage.\n\u201cPhantom limb\u201d pain, for example, is felt in parts of the body that have been amputated, and is an example of \u201cnon-nociceptive\u201d or \u201cneuropathic\u201d pain.\nThis kind of pain is due to problems within the nervous system that are often difficult to diagnose and treat.\nMore common pain experiences such as migraine and backache tend to have both nociceptive and neuropathic components.\nThis frequently applies to pain that becomes chronic: typically, the pain starts as a result of an episode involving tissue damage, such as an accident, but then persists long after the injuries have healed, for weeks, months, or years.", "involving

PHYSICAL DAMAGE \u201d source domain can be seen as potential triggers of embodied simulations of similar experiences.\nThis raises the question of how different metaphorical descriptions of pain differ in terms of the nature of the simulation they may facilitate, or, indeed, in their potential for triggering a simulation at all.\nThis issue is particularly important if we consider that, by and large, we are not exposed to the causes of other people's pain, but only to their verbal descriptions of their pain experiences.\nThe findings of Osaka et al.\n(2004 Osaka, N., Osaka, M.,
