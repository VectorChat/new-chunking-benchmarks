["The difference between substances, events and properties can now be expressed as follows.\nSubstances and events are distinguished from properties by the fact that properties are the kinds of things the instances of which depend for their existence on the particular substance or event by which they are instantiated, whereas substances and events are such as not to depend for their existence on particular instances of properties.", "And substances are distinguished from events in the following way: events are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are temporally composed of further things of the same category (i.e., events): substances are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are not temporally composed of things of the same category (i.e., of substances) but endure singly through the period.", "The most obvious is that it does not, as stated, distinguish between substances and events.\nSome property-instances belong to events rather than substances.\nThe performance of a symphony, for example, is an event, and it may possess the property, in one of its movements, of being allegro.\nIt seems plausible that this particular case of something\u2019s being allegro could not have been exemplified by another performance, but the performance might go on to be andante in another movement, so the event can continue to exist without that original property.\nThe assimilation of events with substances in this way seems strained, however.", "Substance, they say, is the only category of thing which might have only one instance through at least a minimally extended period of time.\nThus, for example, there is no possible world which has, in a given period of time, only one event, for any non-instantaneous event will be made of events which are its parts.\nSimilarly for properties or tropes, there can never be only one because any one entails the existence of others, as, for example, the existence of a red property (instance) entails the existence of (an instance of) the property colour.", "According to this usage, it is a live issue whether the fundamental entities are substances or something else, such as events, or properties located at space-times.\nThis conception of substance derives from the intuitive notion of individual thing or object, which contrast mainly with properties and events.\nThe issue is how we are to understand the notion of an object, and whether, in the light of the correct understanding, it remains a basic notion, or one that must be characterized in more fundamental terms.\nWhether, for example, an object can be thought of as nothing more than a bundle of properties, or a series of events.", "Perception, knowledge, causation, and mind would be examples of this.\nBut the concept of substance is essentially a philosophical term of art.\nIts uses in ordinary language tend to derive, often in a rather distorted way, from the philosophical senses.\n(Such expressions as \u2018a person of substanceor \u2018a substantial reasonwould be cases of this.\n\u2018Illegal substancesis nearer to one of the philosophical uses, but not the main one.)\nThere is an ordinary concept in play when philosophers discuss \u2018substance\u2019, and this, as we shall see, is the concept of object, or thing when this is contrasted with properties or events.", "In particular, we shall look at the issue of whether objects must be individuated under the kind of sortal expressions that correspond to Aristotelian substance concepts, or whether a more generic notion, such as physical body, will suffice.\nThis latter concern will lead on to a consideration of the connection between substance and teleology.\nOne natural response to the question of what distinguishes substances from properties is that properties depend for their existence on substances, for they are properties of objects (that is, of individual substances), but that substances do not similarly depend on properties for their existence.", "This brings out a major difference between substances and events, namely that the temporal parts of events are themselves events in their own right, but the temporal parts of objects\u2014meaning by that expression the temporal phases of an object\u2019s existence\u2014are not themselves objects.\nIndeed, it is not natural to talk of the temporal parts of objects, though some philosophers (led by David Lewis (1986), but see also Sider (2001), Hawley (2001) and the entry on temporal parts) think that there are compelling philosophical reasons for doing so.\nThe rationale implicit in our ordinary concept is that an object is wholly present at all the temporal points of its existence.", "It implies only that something from the category of substance might so exist and that this could not be true of any other category.\nOne might wonder what enabled substances that could not exist alone to count as substances at all.\nIf either of the above accounts are successful, substances, properties and events are distinguished.", "The question remains, however, how far these are nominal and how far real distinctions.\nThat there is a difference between substance concepts and property concepts has definitely been shown, but does it follow that there are, in reality two different kinds of thing, namely properties and substances?\nThe answer might seem to be obvious.\nGiven that there are substance concepts, if those concepts are instantiated, then there are substances in reality.\nCat, table, human being, are substance concepts by the above accounts, and there are cats, tables and humans, so there are substances in reality as well as properties.\nThe matter is not so simple, however.", "They are not individual objects nor kinds of individual object.\nExamples of this usage are water, hydrogen, copper, granite or ectoplasm.\nThere is a connotation of the word \u2018substance\u2019, reflected in the sense of substantial, which signifies durability or even permanence.\nEvents, or Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are never substantial in this sense, because they are fleeting.\nAtoms, fundamental kinds of stuff, gods, or abstract entities, such as Platonic Forms or numbers, might be considered to be substantial to the point of being indestructible or eternal: they last at least as long as the world exists\u2014and, in the case of gods or God, or abstract entities, perhaps longer.", "(1b25\u20132a4) The individual substances are the subjects of properties in the various other categories, and they can gain and lose such properties whilst themselves enduring.\nThere is an important distinction pointed out by Aristotle between individual objects and kinds of individual objects.\nThus, for some purposes, discussion of substance is a discussion about individuals, and for other purposes it is a discussion about universal concepts that designate specific kinds of such individuals.\nIn the Categories, this distinction is marked by the terms \u2018primary substanceand \u2018secondary substance\u2019.", "Aristotle was mainly, if not exclusively, concerned with questions of the first kind, but, as we shall see in sections 2.5.2 and 3, the latter question assumed a prominence later.\nThis association of substance with kinds carries over into a use of the term which is perhaps more scientific, especially chemical, than philosophical.\nThis is the conception according to which substances are kinds of stuff.", "Individual substances are more durable than instances of the properties in the other categories, for it is substances that can take on and lose those other properties.\nIndividuals are not, however, very long-lived and on this criterion Aristotle makes what could be regarded as a concession to Plato, for it is form as universal, which Aristotle does not consider properly substance, which is most durable.\nThere are at least two senses in which substantial forms are eternal.\nFirst, Aristotle believes the world to be eternal and all the same species to exist eternally.\nSo that, even though particular objects are subject to degeneration and decay, the species as such are eternal.", "The distinction has led some commentators to talk of Aristotle\u2019s \u2018two systems\u2019, containing two radically different conceptions of substance.\n(Graham 1987) In the earlier, Categories, substances are simply individuals; in the later work they are complexes of form and matter.\nWhether this represents a change of view, or whether the purposes of the Categories simply did not require reference to the metaphysical analysis of substance is a moot point.", "First published Sun Oct 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Nov 16, 2018 The second use of the concept is more specific.\nAccording to this, substances are a particular kind of basic entity, and some philosophical theories acknowledge them and others do not.\nOn this use, Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are not substances, even though they are the building blocks of\u2014what constitutes \u2018beingfor\u2014his world.", "This question can be given a deflationary or a substantive answer.\nThe deflationary answer is that a substance is a thing which has properties, and that is all one needs to say.\n(See, for example, Crane and Farkas 2004, 143f, and Chisholm 1969.)\nAn object is not composed of properties and some further ingredient\u2014the \u2018thingybit\u2014an object is something which simply has properties.\nAny feature of it can, of course, be regarded as a property, but that does not render an object nothing but a collection of properties.\nThere seems to be a clash of intuitions at this point about what makes sense.", "The properties [ideas] in terms of which sortals are defined do correspond to real qualities and powers in the world.\nThere is no sense in which these building blocks of reality are creatures of our conceptual scheme.\nThe properties invoked by nominal essences are \u201csupposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance\u201d(xxiii 3).", "The division between being said of and being in\u2014that is, between substance concepts and other properties\u2014seems intuitively clear enough until one remembers that substance concepts are complex and are definable in terms of other properties.\nThus, \u2018manis defined as \u2018featherless bipedor \u2018rational animal\u2019, and it would seem that \u2018featherless\u2019, \u2018two-footedor \u2018rationalare properties and hence the kinds of things that are in objects.\nAristotle denies that this is so when they enter into the definition of a substance.\nThe features that specifically make an object the kind of substance that it is, are called differentiae, and Aristotle says the differentia also is not in a subject.", "It is possible, and not uncommon, for concepts of a certain kind to be exemplified, but for it to be the case that, nevertheless, entities answering directly to those concepts are not included in the most economical statement of one\u2019s ontology.\nThis is reductionism, and it can operate in either of two ways, namely either analytical reductionism or what one might call de facto or \u2018nothing butreductionism.\nIn the present case, it would conform to the analytical option if the concept of substance could be analysed in terms of properties or events (e.g., \u2018to be a substance =df to be a collection of properties bound together in way W\u2019).", "(v) and (vi) Kinds of individuals and stuffs.\nAlthough in everything, it is itself no kind of thing and therefore no kind of individual or stuff.\nSubstratum\u2019s claim to substancehood does not rest, however, on meeting the tests itself, but on being what enables particular kinds of substances to be substances.\nAccording to the believer in substratum, it is in virtue of their inhering in a substratum that a collection of properties can constitute an enduring, change-sustaining thing of a certain kind.\nWithout that support, individual instances of properties could, if they could exist at all, be no more than ephemeral events.", "But one might still hold that, though the concept of substance is not precisely analysable and is indispensible, substances in fact are nothing but collections of properties.\nThis latter is the de facto option.\nSo the existence of substances does not show that the concept is important from a philosophical perspective, or, if it has some significance, whether this is just as a necessary part of our conceptual scheme, or as an ineliminable feature of reality itself.\n3.2.1 Bundle theories and their problems We have just noted that there could be analytically reductionist or de facto reductionist accounts of substance in terms of properties.", "In David Hume\u2019s system, impressions and ideas are the substances, for the same reason.\nIn a slightly different way, Forms are Plato\u2019s substances, for everything derives its existence from Forms.\nIn this sense of \u2018substanceany realist philosophical system acknowledges the existence of substances.\nProbably the only theories which do not would be those forms of logical positivism or pragmatism which treat ontology as a matter of convention.\nAccording to such theories, there are no real facts about what is ontologically basic, and so nothing is objectively substance.\nMany of the concepts analysed by philosophers have their origin in ordinary\u2014or at least extra-philosophical\u2014language.", "It is also the case that the properties might be conceived of as universals, or as individuals\u2014that is, property-instances, which are sometimes called \u2018tropes\u2019.\nThere are, therefore, four options for the bundle theorist.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of some relation between properties conceived as universals.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of properties conceived of as individuals, e.g., as property-instances or tropes.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as universals.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as individuals.", "This distinction, however, is one that has to be handled carefully, especially within a realist Kantian framework, such as Strawson provides.\nThis should become clear below when we discuss Wiggins\u2019s theory, which is both Aristotelian and Strawsonian.\nNevertheless, it gives ground for adding the seventh of the marks of substance mentioned in the Introduction, namely that substances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our spatio-temporal framework and individuation and re-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework.", "The situation is different for mental substance.\nThe cogito shows that Descartes definitely believes that each person is a different individual mental substance.\nDescartes, like the atomists, believed that matter operates in an entirely mechanical way.\nThere is, therefore, no causal role for substantial form to play and, hence, no need for such forms.\nHis two substances are each defined in terms of one property (extension for matter and thought for mind), hence there is no problem about the relation between substance and the properties in terms of which it is defined.\nAs he does not have substances as individuals made of kinds of stuff, there is no conflict between individuals and stuffs.", "We saw in the previous section that the differentia in terms of which a substance is defined is not treated as being \u2018inobjects, as other properties are.\nThis seems to suggest that calling an object a substance of a certain sort is not just a way of attributing to it the properties in terms of which it is defined.", "There could be said to be two rather different ways of characterizing the philosophical concept of substance.\nThe first is the more generic.\nThe philosophical term \u2018substancecorresponds to the Greek ousia, which means \u2018being\u2019, transmitted via the Latin substantia, which means \u2018something that stands under or grounds things\u2019.\nAccording to the generic sense, therefore, the substances in a given philosophical system are those things which, according to that system, are the foundational or fundamental entities of reality.\nThus, for an atomist, atoms are the substances, for they are the basic things from which everything is constructed.", "(1978: 220) Hume\u2019s target is any account that postulates a unifying \u2018somethingthat underlies change, whether this be a characterless substratum, a substantial form or (though this is not explicitly mentioned) something like the \u2018continuing lifethat Locke sees as passed on in living things.\nThe crucial point is that a succession of very similar things does not constitute the real continuation of anything, only the illusion of real continuation.\nThus Hume\u2019s treatment of substance is like his treatment of causation, in that he sees both as the projection onto the world of a tendency of our minds either to pass from one thing to another or to associate them in some way.", "(II xxiii 2) The traditional rationale of Locke\u2019s doctrine of \u2018substance in generalis as follows.\nProperties\u2014or, in Locke\u2019s terms qualities\u2014must belong to something\u2014\u2018cannot subsist\u2026without something to support them\u2019.\nOf course, they belong to objects, but what are objects over and above their properties?\nThe special category of substantial form, as found in Aristotle, is rejected.\nAll that seems to be left is a bare \u2018something\u2019, which on pain of regress, has no properties in its own right, except the property of being the owner or support of other properties.\nThis interpretation of Locke\u2019s notion of \u2018substance in generalis, however, a matter of controversy.", "Two major areas of controversy require attention.\nFirst, there are the issues concerning how to characterize substance in contradistinction to properties and the other categories.\nThere are at least two major questions here.\nOne concerns defining the notion of substance.\nIn particular, there has been much debate about whether substance can be accounted for in terms of its special kind of independence.\nThe other is whether substancehood require some extra component beyond properties, (and, if so, what?)\nor whether a \u2018bundle of propertiestheory of substance is adequate.\nSecond there is the relation between substances and our practices of individuation and reidentification.", "It does not seem natural to say that the same event was first allegro, then andante, because it is more natural to attribute the different properties to different parts of the event, which are themselves events (in this case, movements).", "This can be expressed as: The substances in a given system are those entities crucial from the teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucialmeans that other things exist either to constitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.\nDifferent philosophers emphasize different criteria from amongst this list, for reasons connected with their system as a whole.", "The world must possess such enduring objects for it to be intelligible for us\u2014indeed, for us to be part of it, for we are essentially stable bodies amongst other stable bodies.\nThe important point for both Strawson and Kant is that there must be substances for there to be a coherent empirical, spatio-temporal world.\nSubstance has become a formal concept of central importance\u2014that is a concept with a special central role in the structure of our conceptual scheme\u2014rather than being the name for certain kinds of important things in the world.", "They are also the subjects of predication, so they meet criterion (iii).\nLeibniz\u2019s substances, however, are the bearers of change (criterion (iv)) in a very different way from Aristotle\u2019s individual substances.\nAn Aristotelian individual possesses some properties essentially and some accidentally.\nThe accidental properties of an object are ones that can be gained and lost over time, and which it might never have possessed at all: its essential properties are the only ones it had to possess and which it possesses throughout its existence.\nThe situation is different for Leibniz\u2019s monads\u2014which is the name he gives to individual substances, created or uncreated (so God is a monad).", "If the objective were to explain the difference between substance and property in an entirely non-circular way by appealing to the fact that properties are in substances but substances are not in things, this would involve taking the notion of being in as primitive.\nIf we have to distinguish the sense in which properties are in substances from the way in which substances can be in things\u2014such as places\u2014before we can make the original point, then there has not been a non-circular account.\nIf, on the other hand, the objective is simply to differentiate between concepts already in play, then Categories achieves its objective.", "(iii) rests on the intuition that no collection of properties could, in themselves, amount to a substance: the very idea is a category mistake, and only the presence of a special \u2018substantializingelement could do that.\nIt might be argued that this intuition begs the question against the bundle theory.\nAt the current state of the debate, it looks as if there is no compelling reason for accepting substratum.\nThe Aristotelian tradition anchors the concept of substance, at least in nature, primarily to instances of species of natural object.\nThe Kantian tradition ties it to those enduring bodies the individuation of which gives sense and structure to our spatio-temporal framework.", "Whichever of these is the correct interpretation of Aristotle, it was the second which was the core of \u2018Aristotelian scienceas found in scholastic philosophy, and it was this aspect of the Aristotelian doctrine of substance that aroused most opposition amongst seventeenth century philosophers and scientists.\nThey insisted that bodies behave as they do because of the mechanical consequences of the nature of the matter from which they are made: the matter is not \u2018pushed aroundor organized by a substantial form.\nPhilosophers and scientists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries believed that in rejecting such influences they were rejecting the Aristotelian doctrine of substance.", "The point cannot be made quite so simply, however.\nProperties could not exist without objects to be properties of, but neither could substances exist without properties, so the dependence appears to be mutual.\nThis problem can be overcome by more careful expression of the point, making it clear that we are not talking about properties in general and substances in general, but about particular instances or cases of a property and the particular objects to which they belong.\nA particular property instance cannot exist and could not have existed without the substance of which it is a property, but the particular substance can exist and could have existed without that property instance.", "If properties are conceived of as individuals\u2014otherwise known as tropes, property-instances or individualized forms\u2014then there cannot be a problem about the distinctness of exactly similar bundles, for the difference is built into the identity of the elements of the bundle, as it is not if the bundle is made of universals.\nThe problem for this version of the bundle theory seems to be that it is difficult to individuate or distinguish tropes in a way that makes them suitable to be individuals\u2014in one sense, the substances\u2014from which objects are made.", "Buridan, who represents a further development in this direction, says In this sense, I am not the same as I was yesterday, because something was part of my integrity yesterday, which has already been used up, and something was not part of my integrity, which has meanwhile been added by nourishment.\n(Buridan, Physics I,q.10, f. xiii: cited Lagerlund, 476) It is clear that this way of thinking paves the way for atomism and its associated problems as they emerged in early modern philosophy.\nThe concept of substance figures centrally in a positive way for the rationalist philosophers, in a way that it does not for the empiricists.", "It seems, in summary, that there are at least six overlapping ideas that contribute to the philosophical concept of substance.\nSubstances are typified as: being ontologically basic\u2014substances are the things from which everything else is made or by which it is metaphysically sustained; being, at least compared to other things, relatively independent and durable, and, perhaps, absolutely so; being the paradigm subjects of predication and bearers of properties; being, at least for the more ordinary kinds of substance, the subjects of change; being typified by those things we normally classify as objects, or kinds of objects; being typified by kinds of stuff.", "But such \u2018individual substancesare never termed \u2018substancesoutside philosophy.\nReflection on the concept of an object has its first theoretical articulation in Aristotle\u2019s Categories, where he distinguishes between individual objects and the various kinds of properties they can possess.\nHe illustrates the various categories: each [individual term] signifies either substance or quantity or qualification or a relative or where or when or being in a position or having or doing or being affected.", "Would they, without such a substratum be just a stack of qualities, a house of cards with nothing holding them together?\nThere does not seem to be anywhere in the text where Locke discusses this problem\u2014that is, the coherence of atoms as opposed to composite objects\u2014explicitly.\nOne possible resort is to treat solidity as the core or master quality and all the others as features of it.", "Being able to receive contraries.\n(4 a10) A substance can go from being hot to being cold, or from being red to being blue, but the instance of blue in an object cannot similarly take on and lose a wide range of attributes.\nIf substance did not exist it would be impossible for things in any of the other categories to exist.\nThere could be no instances of properties if there were no substances to possess them.\nBut these criteria do not show why \u2018dogis a secondary substance term and \u2018brown thingis not.\nSo we need marks for being a secondary substance, or substance concept.", "Lowe, in his (1998), which contains a very thorough discussion of all the topics discussed in this section, defends an \u2018independenceaccount of substance, which he states in terms of identity, as follows: x is a substance if and only if x is a particular and there is no particular y such that y is not identical to x and the identity of x depends on the identity of y.\nHe considers two objections to his own account which would seem to apply to all independence accounts.\nOne is that it cannot cope with essential properties, for it seems to imply that, for any given property-instance, a substance can exist without it, which is not true of essential properties.", "Let us agree, for purposes of argument, that human being is a kind of substance and that rationality and animality are the properties in terms of which that substance is defined.\nIt is uncontroversial that these properties are meant to be objective features of the external world.\nBut what is the relation between the substantial form and those properties?\nIs the presence of the substantial form human being nothing more than the presence of those properties, or is the form something further which is, in some sense responsible for the presence of those properties?", "David Wiggins (1967, 1980, 2001) has made a sustained attempt to prove that these two objectives necessarily go together and to make the Aristotelian notion of substance, even including its bias towards the biological, central to our practice of individuating objects.\nWiggins assumes that individuating a temporally enduring object involves being able to re-identify it at different times and under different descriptions.", "It is contested whether Locke actually believed in substance as a characterless substratum.\nAlthough the first quotation above seems to affirm it, Locke also in the same section speaks disparagingly about the idea, comparing it to the notion that the world rests on an elephant, which rests on a tortoise, and so on: in other words, as not constituting a real explanation at all.", "This internal constitution \u201cmakes the whole subsist by itself\u201d (xxiii 6).\nThus Locke is entirely realist about individual bodies and their properties.\nHe is more conventionalist, however, about their classification under particular sortals.\nThere are four ways in which he is a conceptualist about particular substances, as we classify them.\nThere is nothing over and above the properties of an object corresponding to our substance concepts\u2014nothing, that is, like a substantial form\u2014present in the world.\nSortals are entirely formed by our minds, in the light of the properties perceived to be in the world.", "Sortals, unlike Aristotelian species, place no constraints on how individual objects must or ought to be.\nLocke\u2019s contribution is, therefore, three-fold.\nHe brings to centre stage the question of whether properties require some substratum or bare particular to inhere in or belong to.", "We shall see later that the Kantian tradition adds a seventh mark of substance: substances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our spatio-temporal framework, and the individuation and re-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework.\n(It should be remarked in passing that at least one major expositor of Aristotle (Irwin: 1988, especially chs 1, 9, 10) attributes a very similar intention to Aristotle himself.)\nIn section 3.5 we shall introduce a notion grounded in Aristotle\u2019s account, but which has not naturally found a place in the earlier discussion, namely the connection between substance and teleology.", "For Spinoza, there is only one substance, the existence of which is demonstrated by a version of the ontological argument, which is thought of as being both God and Nature.\nIt is an unending controversy whether Spinoza was a pantheist, or an atheist who called nature \u2018Godbecause it was the one true substance and existed necessarily.\nEverything else is a mode of this one substance.\nThe view is analogous to a claim that the universe is space-time as a whole, with matter as distortions in it.\nIf this were true, material objects would be modes of space-time.\nThe analogy would be more exact if one also thought of the laws of nature as equivalent to the divine intellect immanent in nature.", "It is clear, however, that this is a serious oversimplification.\nFor a more nuanced and sophisticated view, see Lagerlund (2012), on which this section draws extensively.\nOur discussion of Aristotle ended by returning to the issue if the unity of substantial form \u2013 what is the difference between a collection of \u2018essentialproperties and the form as a unitary entity.\nVarious aspects of this issue of the unity of substantial form preoccupied medieval philosophers.\nAccording to Aquinas, a substance possessed only one form, and its matter was the essentially characterless prime matter.", "Italics added.)\nThis solution, as Bennett recognizes, makes substancehood a function of how we operate on the properties we perceive.\nIt is, in that sense, more Kantian than realist.\nAs what it recognizes as out there in the world is just a bundle of properties, it does not dissolve the problem in the way that a deflationist would require.\nSubstantive theories take the thought of a further component seriously, and, though they do not seem to be generally distinguished, there are two main conceptions of this extra element, which I will call the \u2018thin particularand the \u2018substratumconceptions.", "This applies to the active intellect, which is an essential feature of all human intellects, and to the immaterial movers of the cosmos described in Metaphysics, Book Lambda.\n(Further consideration of these topics would take us into Aristotle\u2019s philosophy of mind and his theology.)\nAs we have seen, substances are the paradigm subjects of predication and change, so (iii) and (iv) are met.\nAs Aristotle\u2019s substances are individual things and kinds of things (v) is met.\nA nod is made in the direction of stuffs and kinds of stuff, but Aristotle does not develop this thought, so (vi) is barely met.", "Thus Fido the dog is a primary substance\u2014an individual\u2014but dog or doghood is the secondary substance or substantial kind.\nEach arm of this distinction raises different issues.\nIf one is concerned with kinds of substance, one obvious question that will arise is \u2018what makes something a thing of that kind (for example, what is involved in being a dog)?This is the question of the essence of substantial kinds.\nBut if one is concerned with individuals, the parallel question is \u2018what makes something that particular individual of a given kind (for example, what is involved in a dog\u2019s being and remaining Fido)?This is the question of individual essences and of identity over time.", "Michael Ayers (1975, 1991b: 39\u201350) believes that the only substratum that Locke acknowledges is the unknown\u2014and, Locke thinks, unknowable by us\u2014structure of the minute parts.\nThis is what he elsewhere characterizes as the real essence.\nIt is clear from the text that Locke is at least uneasy with the idea of \u2018pure substance in general\u2019, but it is less clear whether he feels obliged to accept an idea he dislikes, or whether he rejects it.\n(For the view that he accepts it, and why, see Bennett, 1971 and 1987.)\nThere are indications that Locke is confused about what he means by \u2018substratum\u2019.", "Different properties might have been hung on this hook.\nIt is not so clear, by contrast, that a substratum of the kind Locke considers, or like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter, is a particular in this sense.\nIt is more like a kind of stuff\u2014the substantiveness on to which properties are stuck.\nOn this conception, the suggestion that the \u2018pieceof substratum or \u2018prime matterthat is here in object a, might always instead have been there in object b, seems to lack content.\nIt is useful at this point to take note of the three different functions the thin particular or substratum might fulfil.", "On the one hand, Ockham was committed to hylomorphism, in that a substance is composed of form and matter.\nBut he reverses the priorities of Aquinas and Scotus by saying that the parts are actual in their own right and do not derive their actuality from the whole: rather, the whole is nothing but the sum of its parts.\nThis line of thought opened the way to atomism and to treating the unity of wholes as a matter of convention or degree.", "Aristotle acknowledges that things under (vi)\u2014\u2018natural bodies such as fire and water and everything of that sort(1028 b10\u201311)\u2014are, or are thought to be, substances.\nBut, without seeming to give much argument, he strongly favours (v) over (vi).\nThe elimination of matter as a good candidate for being substance, leaves either form alone or the composite of form and matter.", "It is only by understanding the world as possessing enduring spatio-temporal objects, which enter into causal relations with each other (that is, it is only by applying the categories of substance and causation) that we can have intelligible experience.\nSubstances\u2014that is, a framework of stable, enduring objects\u2014are essential, but the source of this necessity lies not how the world is in itself, but in the framework which we are obliged to impose.\nIn the Kantian philosophy of P. F. Strawson (1959, 1966), this framework of necessity is taken in a more common-sense and realist spirit.", "Many of the pre-socratic philosophers in fact had a concept of substance rather like that above attributed to chemistry: that is, their emphasis was on criterion (vi) above.\nThey thought, that is, that the being of the universe (hence they were pursuing substance in sense (i)) consisted in some kind or kinds of stuff.\nThales, for example, thought that everything was essentially water, and Anaximenes that everything was a form of air.\nFor Anaximander, the \u2018stuffin question was indeterminate, so that it could transmute into the various determinate stuffs such as water, air earth and fire.", "I must admit to having difficulties seeing why the view that objects are constituted solely out of property-instances should commit one to a mereological view, any more than the theory that they are constituted solely from material particles would, so I do not see this as a special problem for the bundle theory.\n3.2.2.\nThe concept of substratum or \u2018thin particularIf one is not satisfied with a bundle theory of substance, so that one thinks that an individual substance is more than a collection of properties, how is one to understand this \u2018more\u2019?", "We have seen that Locke\u2019s particular substances are kinds of things, and because they are kinds they correspond to Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.\nBut we have also seen that the boundaries between these kinds are largely a matter of convention, which is not true of Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.\nIn so far as their individuation is dependent on human convention, they are not ultimately real in their own right.\nBut though they are not real as kinds, the individual parcels of matter that we classify in these ways are perfectly real.\nLocke does not, as far as I can see, refer to these individuals as \u2018substances\u2019.", "By contrast, atomists such as Democritus took those determinate particular objects they called \u2018atomsto be the substance of the universe.\nAtoms are objects in our ordinary sense, though they are not our ordinary objects: they are not dogs and cats or tables and chairs.\nThey are the subjects of predication, but they do not change their intrinsic properties.\nClassical atoms are, therefore, strong instances of (i) and (ii), but somewhat deviant cases of (iii) and (v).\nPlato rejected these materialist attempts to explain everything on the basis of that of which it was made.\nAccording to Plato, the governing principles were the intelligible Forms which material objects attempted to copy.", "In order to begin to see how Aristotle tackled this problem we need the apparatus of form and matter, which does not appear in the Categories.\n(We will see when discussing contemporary theories in section 3.1, however, that it is not clear that even now can we provide a wholly non-circular account of substance.)\n2.2.2 Metaphysics The Categories sets out important logical distinctions between different kinds of attribute, but it does not enter into a metaphysical analysis of substance itself.\nThis takes place mainly in Metaphysics, Book Z.\nIn the latter, the analysis of substances in terms of form and matter is developed, whereas these notions have no place in Categories.", "He asserts that the substantial nature of the physical world is the unknown structure of atomic parts, not a substantial form which reflects our usual concepts.\nThird, he develops a theory of substance which is realist about particular objects and their properties, but conceptualist or conventionalist about our classifications, within the constraints that the facts about particulars and properties impose.\nThere is one important context, however, where Locke does not appear to talk in a conventionalist way about sortal identity, but in a way that seems to be reminiscent of substantial forms.", "It is plausible to maintain the general thesis that there are many issues on which Hume was a sceptic or nihilist, but where his legacy is more reductionist than sceptical or nihilist.\nThis general thesis can be explained and illustrated by considering his treatment of substance, for it is a case in question.\nAccording to Hume, in the Treatise, our belief in substance is the result of a mistake or illusion.", "All these issues are very controversial, and different philosophers have different intuitions.\n(See, for example, Rea 1997.)\nBut, if one were to conclude that the statue and the lump are neither identical nor stand in the constitution relation, what else could one say?", "Spinoza\u2019s view represents the extreme end of stressing the status of substance as the fundamental existent conceived of as wholly necessary and self-subsistent: that is, criteria (i) and (ii) in the original list come to take on maximum weight.\nNothing but the universe as a whole meets this criterion fully.\nLeibniz was not satisfied by this conception of divine substance, at least in part because it confines God to what actually exists.\nFor Leibniz, God contains within himself all possibilities, not just the actual world: this latter is just that maximal set of possibilities that he has best reason to actualize.", "Substances, considered as kinds, or instances of kinds, can sustain change\u2014living things, for example, change in size throughout their lives.\nMost individual parcels of matter, however, become different individuals if they change any of their parts; although we have seen that this does not apply to living things, where there seems to be a metaphysical component called sameness of life.", "One of these variants is in the empiricist tradition.\nThat tradition modified Hume\u2019s approach by developing it into a form of reductionism.\nThe experiences which gave rise, through habit, to the mistaken belief (in, for example, substance or causation) are presented as what the belief really affirms.\nThat is, the empirical basis for what Hume deems to be an illusion, is reinterpreted as the reductive account of the concept.\nCausation then becomes constant conjunction, or substance a name for a bundle of properties organized in a certain way or the continuing of the possibility of certain sensations.\nKant developed the other variant.", "Thus, Fido is a primary substance, and dog\u2014the secondary substance\u2014can be predicated of him.\nFat, brown, and taller than Rover are also predicable of him, but in a rather different way from that in which dog is.\nAristotle distinguishes between two kinds of predicables, namely those which are \u2018said ofobjects and those which are \u2018inobjects.\nThe interpretation of these expressions is, as usually with Aristotelian cruxes, very controversial, but a useful way of looking at it is as follows.\nDog is said of Fido because it characterizes him as a whole.", "(One subject that has not been discussed is the connection between the doctrine of substance and teleology.\nAristotle regards this relation as important, but in this entry it will have a section of its own, 3.5 below.)\nThe standard account of the medieval treatment of the topic is that S. Thomas Aquinas is the only important figure and what he says differs little from Aristotle, except for making things more rigid and formal.", "Aristotle acknowledges that matter can be a subject of predication and of change, thereby meeting one of the main criteria set up in Categories (1028 b35ff).\nThis suggests an inadequacy or incompleteness in the account in Categories, for there he had seemed to assume that being the subject of predication belonged peculiarly to substance, and also that a subject is an individual of an appropriate kind\u2014what he calls a \u2018this such\u2019: and matter is not an individual, but that from which an individual is made.\nTwo of the criteria of substancehood presented in the Introduction above are: (v) being individuals and kinds of individual; (vi) being stuffs and kinds of stuff.", "It is not possible to investigate here Leibniz\u2019s reasons for these apparently very strange views.\nOur present concern is with whether, and in what sense, Leibniz\u2019s substances are subjects of change.\nOne can say that, in so far as, at all times, they reflect the whole of reality, then they do not change.\nBut in so far as they reflect some parts of that reality more vividly than others, depending on their position in space and time, they can be said to change.\nAccording to Locke, we have two conceptions of substance.\nOne is a \u2018notion of pure substance in general(Essay II xxiii 2), the other \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substance(II xxiii 3).", "If a monad is at place p at time t, it will contain all the features of the universe at all times, but with those relating to its own time and place most vividly, and others fading out roughly in accordance with temporal and spatial distance.\nBecause there is a continuum of perspectives on reality, there is an infinite number of these substances.\nNevertheless, there is internal change in the monads, because the respect in which its content is vivid varies with time and with action.\nIndeed, the passage of time just is the change in which of the monad\u2019s contents are most vivid.", "Whereas, for Aristotle, the properties that an object has to possess and those that it possesses throughout its existence coincide, they do not do so for Leibniz.\nThat is, for Leibniz, even the properties that an object possesses only for a part of its existence are essential to it.\nEvery monad bears each of its properties as part of its nature, so if it were to have been different in any respect, it would have been a different entity.", "When we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the smooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the succession\u2026When we compare its situation after a considerable change the progress of the thought is broken; and consequently we are presented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which contradictions, the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and invisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these variations; and this unintelligible something it calls a substance, or original and first matter.", "Both these conceptions of substance provide difficulties of interpretation.\nThey also both relate to issues in contemporary philosophy of substance, in which Locke\u2019s influence is almost as important as Aristotle\u2019s.\n2.5.1 Locke on \u2018pure substance in generalLocke expresses this idea as follows: The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of those qualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist, sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia, which, according to the true import of the word, is in plain English, standing under or upholding.", "Others disagreed.", "The rationalistssubstances are not, however, the individual objects of everyday life.\nDescartes believed in only two kinds of substance: material body, which is defined by extension, and mental substance, which is defined by thought, which, in this context, is more or less equivalent to consciousness.\nDescartes (like Aristotle and unlike most of his contemporaries and immediate successors) was not an atomist.\nHe did not believe in a void between bodies, so there is a sense in which there is just one material substance, numerically as well as specifically.\nFor Descartes, therefore, material substance falls more naturally into the stuff category, rather than into the thing category.", "Perhaps it is better, therefore, to see Aristotle in Categories not as defining \u2018substance\u2019, so that someone wholly lacking the concept might come to understand it, but as exhibiting the marks and characteristics of a primitive concept on which we have an intuitive grasp.\nIf we understand his project in this way, we can see Aristotle as presenting various marks of substance in Categories.\nThe marks of primary substance are: Being objects of predication but not being themselves predicable of anything else (at least, not in the way entities in the other categories are: see the problem about attribution to location above).", "(Armstrong 1989, 115ff) For example, if an object has a size, a mass, and a motion, are the size and the mass different tropes and is it not strange to think of the size alone as a genuine particular suited to be treated as an \u2018atomiccomponent of the whole?", "One would never ask what binds together a patch of colour and its shape, because the shape is the shape of the colour patch, and, though the shape of something can change, its shape cannot come away from it, like a separable component.\nPerhaps the shape, size and density of an atom are similarly features of the solidity.\nThe quality solidity would then become equivalent to the notion of material stuff or material substance and Locke shows no sign of wanting to elide the ideas of quality and substance in this way, though it should be noted that this is what Descartes does with extension.", "Third, is that idea of substance as a bare substratum, which is \u201ca supposed, I know not what, to support those ideas we call accidents.\u201d (xxiii 15).\nPerhaps it is more profitable to ask whether, in his own terms, Locke ought to have accepted bare substratum.\nIf we accept that the question of what binds together the qualities of a macroscopic object can be answered by appeal to the minute parts, the issue would then be what binds the primary qualities of atoms.\nDo the size, shape, mass, solidity of a particular atom require a bare substratum to inhere in for them to constitute a coherent object?", "Thus we come to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water, etc\u2026 (II xxiii 3) Thus, for Locke, the real essence is an unknown atomic constitution.\nThe types that we categorize them in depend on the properties we happen to be able to perceive and kinds or sorts are defined in terms of these observable properties.\nDefinition in these terms he calls \u2018nominal essence\u2019.\nOur concepts of natural substances presuppose that the nominal essence hides a real essence\u2014that is, that all water, gold, horses etc are in some way similar at a microscopic level.", "Leibniz acknowledges created substances, though they are very intimately dependent on God.\nIn the Discourse on Metaphysics, (Section 14), he says: it is clear that created substances depend on God, who conserves them and indeed who produces them continuously by a kind of emanation, just as we produce our thoughts.\n(1998: 66) The analogy with thought hardly emphasizes the independence of substance!\nNevertheless, created substances do constitute the created world, and do, in that sense, meet criterion (i) for being substance.", "There were two major problems that the Aristotelian tradition has faced in the modern period.\nThey are: (1) explaining and justifying the sense in which substantial forms have causal or explanatory power, especially in the light of a developed mechanistic chemistry or physics; (2) the difficulty in understanding the relation of substantial form to properties, especially those in terms of which a given substance is defined.\nThese are connected.\nIt is because the substantial form has genuine causal force that it is conceived of by Aristotle as a unified entity in its own right, and not just as a name for the collocation of properties in terms of which it is defined.", "Aristotle is undoubtedly a realist about substantial forms, in the sense of thinking them to be something more than a mere collection of properties, but how are we to understand this \u2018more\u2019?\nIt would be universally agreed by scholars that substantial forms are real in the sense that they play an irreducible and ineliminable explanatory role in the behaviour of the things in which they are the form.\nThere are two interpretations of what Aristotle meant by this, one of which seems compatible with modern science and the other not.", "In general, Locke\u2019s particular substances are not ontologically basic, because their essences are nominal, though this is not so clearly true for sortals naming biological kinds.\nLocke\u2019s conceptualism about such substances makes most of the tests irrelevant, which are cast within a realist framework.\nLocke\u2019s \u2018particular substancesare kinds which are individuated conventionally, and so are not real substantial kinds, by Aristotelian standards.\nBut Locke is not without substance other than substratum, for his real essence\u2014that is, the atoms and their structures\u2014are his real substances, and what we say above about the substantiality of atoms also goes for Locke.", "First, there is organization of the minute parts of particular kinds of objects, which is responsible for the manifest properties of those objects, and which he thinks will always fall beyond our knowledge.\nSecond is the mystery of what holds the minute parts together: the problem of explaining attraction in a system that only understands influence by impact.\n(xxiii 23).", "For footed and two-footed are said of man as subject, but are not in a subject; neither footed not two-footed is in man.\n(3 a23\u20135) It would seem that these properties belong to objects in different ways when they are part of a definition from when they are not.\nThe issue is what constitutes the unity of the species or secondary substance: why is it not just a collection of properties and, if it is just such a collection, why is it so different from any other collection of properties?", "Fat and the others are described as being in because they pick out a constituent feature that could be said to be, in a logical though not a physical sense, part of, or in him.\nFido the individual is not attributable to any further thing at all.\nThis account is intuitive, but perhaps it cannot be treated as a formally adequate definition of the notion of primary substance or individual.\nFido the individual could be said to be in a certain location and so attributed to something, namely a place.", "One could plausibly say that an account is intuitively more appealing, the more of the criteria it can find a place for.\nProbably, the Aristotelian tradition comes nearest to doing this.\nAlmost all major philosophers have discussed the concept of substance and an attempt to cover all of this history would be unwieldy.\nThe selection made will concentrate on those philosophers in whom the broadly analytic tradition has shown most interest.\nFirst we shall look at the development of the concept in the ancient world, culminating in the work of Aristotle.", "To give a rough idea, ideas of substance are man, horse; of quantity: four foot, five foot; of qualification; white, grammatical; of a relative: double, half, larger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when: yesterday, last year; of being in a position: is-lying, is-sitting; of having: has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of being-affected: being-cut, being-burnt.", "The matter is still an essential component in the substance, but not, so to speak, as an equal partner with the form, but as the catalyst by means of which the form becomes an individual substance.\nIt is clear, however, that if one holds that Aristotle thinks that forms are universals, then forms are not substance, for, in his attacks on Plato, Aristotle makes it plain that universals are not substance.\nSubstances for Aristotle are individuals, but it is much debated whether they are individualized forms or composites of form and matter.\nThere are at least three serious questions about Aristotle\u2019s substantial forms.", "If this is correct, then our ordinary \u2018natural kindconcepts, like water and gold, have built into them intimations of a deeper unity than that supplied by superficial features, even if it be allied to a complete agnosticism about what that unity might consist in or whether we might ever uncover it.\nHow does Locke, then, rate against the six criteria for substancehood that were set up in the introduction?\nAccepting, for these purposes, that Locke believed in substratum, we can apply these tests both to substratum, and to his \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2019.\nFirst, consider substratum.\n(i) Ontological basicness.", "It reflects his emphasis on criterion (i), together with his particular view about the way in which forms are basic.\nThere are two main sources for Aristotle\u2019s approach to substance, the Categories and Metaphysics Z.\nThese will be discussed in turn.\n2.2.1 Categories Aristotle\u2019s account in Categories can, with some oversimplification, be expressed as follows.\nThe primary substances are individual objects, and they can be contrasted with everything else\u2014secondary substances and all other predicables\u2014because they are not predicable of or attributable to anything else."]
