healthy seabed communities\nNatural predators of the California spiny lobster include bony fish such as the California sheepshead giant sea bass and cabezone sharks including the horn shark and leopard shark octopuses and sea otters\nIn response to an approaching predator spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick @-@ slip phenomenon akin

the most citations about 10 % are based on Hubble data", "On January 13 1994 NASA declared the mission a complete success and showed the first sharper images\nAt the time the mission was one of the most complex involving five long extra @-@ vehicular activity periods\nIts success was a boon for NASA as well as for the astronomers with a more capable space telescope", "to reveal hitherto

by Discovery took place in December 1999 and was a split @-@ off from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed\nThe fourth failed a few weeks before the mission rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations\nThe mission replaced all six gyroscopes replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer installed a Voltage / temperature Improvement Kit ( VIK ) to prevent battery overcharging and replaced thermal insulation blankets\nThe new computer is 20 times faster with six times more memory than the DF @-@ 224 it replaced\nIt increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages\n= = = Servicing Mission 3B = = = Servicing Mission 3B flown by Columbia in March 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument with the FOC ( which except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry was the last of the original instruments ) being replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS )\nThis meant that COSTAR was no longer required since all new instruments had built @-@ in correction for the main mirror aberration\nThe mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed @-@ cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time providing 30 percent more power", "Eventually following the resumption of shuttle flights in 1988 the launch of the telescope was scheduled for 1990\nOn April 24 1990 shuttle mission STS @-@ 31 saw Discovery launch the telescope successfully into its planned orbit", "In November 1972 Martello lectured at the first Friends of the Craft conference held at New York 's First Unitarian Church\nIn April 1973 he moved to England for six months where he was initiated and trained in the three degrees of Gardnerian Wicca by the Sheffield coven run by Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther\nHe continued to encourage acceptance of homosexuality within the Pagan and Witchcraft community authoring an article titled \" The Gay Pagan \" for Green Egg magazine\nHe expressed the view that homophobic Wiccans were \" sexually insecure \" and that they viewed the religion simply as \" a ritual means of fornication \"\nHe was also among the prominent male Pagans to endorse feminist and female @-@ only variants of Wicca such as the Dianic Wicca promoted by Zsuzsanna Budapest", "= = = Color images = = = All images from Hubble are monochromatic grayscale in which its cameras incorporate a variety of filters each sensitive to specific wavelengths of light\nColor images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters\nThis process can also create false @-@ color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue", "In January 2004 O 'Keefe said he would review his decision to cancel the final servicing mission to HST due to public outcry and requests from Congress for NASA to look for a way to save it\nThe National Academy of Sciences convened an official panel which recommended in July 2004 that the HST should be preserved despite the apparent risks\nTheir report urged \" NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope \"\nIn August 2004 O 'Keefe asked Goddard Space Flight Center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission\nThese plans were later canceled the robotic mission being described as \" not feasible \"\nIn late 2004 several Congressional members led by Senator Barbara Mikulski held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support ( including thousands of letters from school children across the country ) to get the Bush Administration and NASA to reconsider the decision to drop plans for a Hubble rescue mission", "The commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin @-@ Elmer\nRelations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns\nNASA found that Perkin @-@ Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately did not assign its best optical scientists to the project ( as it had for the prototype ) and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror\nWhile the commission heavily criticized Perkin @-@ Elmer for these managerial failings NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument"]
