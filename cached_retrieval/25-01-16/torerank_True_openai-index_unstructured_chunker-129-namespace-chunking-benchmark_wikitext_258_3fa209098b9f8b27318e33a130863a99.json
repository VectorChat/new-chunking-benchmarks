US astronomers using Hubble discovered a tiny fifth moon moving around icy Pluto", "One rather complex task that falls to STScI is scheduling observations for the telescope\nHubble is in a low @-@ Earth orbit to enable servicing missions but this means that most astronomical targets are occulted by the Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit\nObservations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly due to elevated radiation levels and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun ( precluding observations of Mercury ) Moon and Earth\nThe solar avoidance angle is about 50 \u00b0 to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA\nEarth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments\nIf the FGSs are turned off however the Moon and Earth can be observed\nEarth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat @-@ fields for the WFPC1 instrument\nThere is a so @-@ called continuous viewing zone ( CVZ ) at roughly 90 \u00b0 to the plane of Hubble 's orbit in which targets are not occulted for long periods\nDue to the precession of the orbit the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks\nBecause the limb of the Earth is always within about 30 \u00b0 of regions within the CVZ the brightness of scattered earthshine may be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations", "= = = Servicing Mission 3A = = = Servicing Mission 3A flown by Discovery took place in December 1999 and was a split @-@ off from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed\nThe fourth failed a few weeks before the mission rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations\nThe mission replaced all six gyroscopes replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer installed a Voltage / temperature Improvement Kit ( VIK ) to prevent battery overcharging and replaced thermal insulation blankets\nThe new computer is 20 times faster with six times more memory than the DF @-@ 224 it replaced\nIt increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages\n= = = Servicing Mission 3B = = = Servicing Mission 3B flown by Columbia in March 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument with the FOC ( which except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry was the last of the original instruments ) being replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS )\nThis meant that COSTAR was no longer required since all new instruments had built @-@ in correction for the main mirror aberration\nThe mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed @-@ cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time providing 30 percent more power", "During the 1990s Martello retired from his public work\nDoyle White noted that while Martello faded from prominence as the head of the Strega Wicca movement the tradition gained a \" new public advocate \" in Raven Grimassi\nMartello died of cancer on 29 June 2000\nBruno was the executrix of his estate", "= = = Impact on astronomy = = = Many objective measures show the positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy\nOver 9 @,@ 000 papers based on Hubble data have been published in peer @-@ reviewed journals and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings\nLooking at papers several years after their publication about one @-@ third of all astronomy papers have no citations while only 2 % of papers based on Hubble data have no citations\nOn average a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non @-@ Hubble data\nOf the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations about 10 % are based on Hubble data", "In the early 1980s NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss Key Projects\nThese were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time which would be explicitly dedicated to each project\nThis guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early in case the telescope failed sooner than expected\nThe panels identified three such projects : 1 ) a study of the nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies ; 2 ) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3 ) a project to determine the Hubble Constant within ten percent by reducing the errors both external and internal in the calibration of the distance scale", "The music of Hybrid Theory draws from diverse inspirations\nBennington 's singing style is influenced by acts such as Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots while the riffs and playing techniques of guitarist Brad Delson are modeled after Deftones Guns N ' Roses U2 and The Smiths\nMike Shinoda 's rapping present in seven tracks is very close to The Roots ' style\nThe lyrical content of the songs primarily touches upon the problems that Bennington encountered during his childhood including child abuse constant and excessive drug and alcohol abuse the divorce of his parents isolation disappointments and the aftermath feelings of failed relationships\nStylistically the album has been described as nu metal rap metal and alternative metal"]
