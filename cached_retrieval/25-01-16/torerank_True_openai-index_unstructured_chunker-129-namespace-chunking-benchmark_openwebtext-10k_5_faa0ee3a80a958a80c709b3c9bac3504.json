["British historian Ian Kershaw wrote that the genocide and extreme brutality used by the Nazis was their way of ensuring the Lebensraum (\"living space\") for the people who met the strict requirements of being part of Hitler's Aryan Herrenvolk (\"Aryan master race\") and the elimination of the Slavic people: The Nazi revolution was broader than just the Holocaust.\nIts second goal was to eliminate Slavs from central and eastern Europe and to create a Lebensraum for Aryans.\n... As Bartov (The Eastern Front; Hitler's Army) shows, it barbarised the German armies on the eastern front.\nMost of their three million men, from generals to ordinary soldiers, helped exterminate captured Slav soldiers and civilians.\nThis was sometimes cold and deliberate murder of individuals (as with Jews), sometimes generalised brutality and neglect.\n... German soldiers' letters and memoirs reveal their terrible reasoning: Slavs were 'the Asiatic-Bolshevik' horde, an inferior but threatening race.\nOnly a minority of officers and men were Nazi members.\n[180]", "In October 1941, the commander of the 12th Infantry Division sent out a directive saying \"the carrying of information is mostly done by youngsters in the ages of 11\u201314\" and that \"as the Russian is more afraid of the truncheon than of weapons, flogging is the most advisable measure for interrogation\".\n[32] The Nazis at the beginning of the war banned sexual relations between Germans and foreign slave workers.\n[33] In accordance to these new racial laws issued by the Nazis; in November 1941, the commander of the 18th Panzer Division warned his soldiers not to have sex with \"sub-human\" Russian women, and ordered that any Russian women found having sex with a German soldier was to be handed over to the SS to be executed at once.\n[34] A decree ordered on 20 February 1942 declared that sexual intercourse between a German woman and a Russian worker or prisoner of war would result in the latter being punished by the death penalty.\n[35] During the war, hundreds of Polish and Russian men were found guilty of \"race defilement\" for their relations with German women and were executed.\n[36][37]", "As a result of these views, the majority of the German Army worked enthusiastically with the SS in murdering Jews in the Soviet Union.\nBritish historian Richard J. Evans wrote that junior officers tended to be especially zealous National Socialists with a third of them being Nazi Party members in 1941.\n[27] The Wehrmacht did not just obey Hitler's criminal orders for Barbarossa because of obedience, but rather because they shared Hitler's belief that the Soviet Union was run by Jews, and that it was necessary for Germany to completely destroy \"Judeo-Bolshevism\".\n[14] J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster[who?]\nwrote that the majority of Wehrmacht officers sincerely believed that most Red Army commissars were Jews, and that the best way to defeat the Soviet Union was to kill all of the commissars so as to deprive the Russian soldiers of their Jewish leaders.\n[30]", "As a result of this sort of propaganda, the majority of the Wehrmacht Heer officers and soldiers tended to regard the war in Nazi terms, seeing their Soviet opponents as so much sub-human trash deserving to be trampled upon.\n[26] One German soldier wrote home to his father on 4 August 1941 that: The pitiful hordes on the other side are nothing but felons who are driven by alcohol and the [commissars'] threat of pistols at their heads..\nThey are nothing but a bunch of assholes!\n... Having encountered these Bolshevik hordes and having seen how they live has made a lasting impression on me.\nEveryone, even the last doubter, knows today that the battle against these sub-humans, who've been whipped into a frenzy by the Jews, was not only necessary but came in the nick of time.\nOur F\u00fchrer has saved Europe from certain chaos.\n[26]", "The German people is deeply indebted to the Fuehrer, because if these animals, our enemies here, had reached Germany, murders of a nature not yet witnessed in the world would have occurred.. No newspaper can describe what we have seen.\nIt verges on the unbelievable, and even the Middle Ages do not compare with what has transpired here.\nReading Der Stuermer and observing its photos give only a limited impression of what we have seen here and of the crimes committed here by the Jews.\nJudith Levin and Daniel Uziel state that this type of writing and opinion was very common in correspondence left by German soldiers, especially on the Eastern Front.\n[205] Other samples of German soldiers' letters were sent home and copied during the war by a special Polish Home Army cell that infiltrated the German postal system.\n[206] These letters have been analyzed by historians and the picture they paint is similar to views expressed by Levin and Uziel.\nMany soldiers wrote openly about the extermination of Jews and were proud of it.\nSupport for \"untermensch\" and \"master race\" concepts were also part of the attitude expressed by German soldiers.\n[206] Presented examples reflecting this trend include samples such as:", "The \"Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia\" issued by the OKW on 19 May 1941 declared \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" to be the most deadly enemy of the German nation, and that \"It is against this destructive ideology and its adherents that Germany is waging war\".\n[21] The guidelines went on to demand \"ruthless and vigorous measures against Bolshevik inciters, guerrillas, saboteurs, Jews, and the complete elimination of all active and passive resistance.\n\"[21] Influenced by the guidelines, in a directive sent out to the troops under his command, General Erich Hoepner of the Panzer Group 4 stated: The war against Russia is an important chapter in the German nation's struggle for existence.\nIt is the old battle of the Germanic against the Slavic people, of the defence of European culture against Muscovite-Asiatic inundation and of the repulse of Jewish Bolshevism.\nThe objective of this battle must be the demolition of present-day Russia and must therefore be conducted with unprecedented severity.\nEvery military action must be guided in planning and execution by an iron resolution to exterminate the enemy remorselessly and totally.\nIn particular, no adherents of the contemporary Russian Bolshevik system are to be spared.\n[22]", "In 1989, the British historian Richard J. Evans wrote that right from the beginning of the war against the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht fought a genocidal war of \"extreme brutality and barbarism\".\n[181] Evans noted that the Wehrmacht officers regarded the Russians as \"sub-human\", were from the time of the invasion of Poland in 1939 telling their troops that war was caused by \"Jewish vermin\", and explained to the troops that the war against the Soviet Union was a war to wipe out what were variously called \"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans\", the \"Mongol hordes\", the \"Asiatic flood\" and the \"red beast\".\n[182]", "In particular, both Moltke and Admiral Canaris noted that the German claim that Soviet POWs had no rights because the Soviet Union had not ratified the Geneva Convention was invalid as Germany had ratified the Geneva Convention and thus under international law was obliged to provide humane treatment for the POWs in its care.\nIn response, Field-Marshal Wilhelm Keitel wrote: \"These scruples accord with the soldierly concepts of a chivalrous war!\nHere we are concerned with the extermination of an ideology.\nThat is why I approve and defend this measure\".\n[17]", "Much more evidence of such trends and thoughts among Wehrmacht soldiers exists and is subject to research by historians.\n[205]", "In the same spirit, General M\u00fcller, who was the Wehrmacht's senior liaison officer for legal matters, in a lecture to military judges on June 11, 1941 advised the judges present that \"...in the operation to come, feelings of justice must in certain situations give way to military exigencies and then revert to old habits of warfare.. One of the two adversaries must be finished off.\nAdherents of the hostile attitude are not to be conserved, but liquidated\".\n[23] General M\u00fcller declared that, in the war against the Soviet Union, any Soviet civilian who was felt to be hindering the German war effort was to be regarded as a \"guerrilla\" and shot on the spot.\nThe Army's Chief of Staff, General Franz Halder, declared in a directive that in the event of guerrilla attacks, German troops were to impose \"collective measures of force\" by massacring villages.\n[23] In November 1935, the psychological war laboratory of the Reich War Ministry submitted a study about how best to undermine Red Army morale should a German-Soviet war break out.\n[24] Working closely with the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian Fascist Party based in Harbin, the German psychological warfare unit created a series of pamphlets written in Russian for distribution in the Soviet Union.\nMuch of it was designed to play on Russian anti-Semitism, with one pamphlet calling the \"Gentlemen commissars and party functionaries\" a group of \"mostly filthy Jews\".\nThe pamphlet ended with the call for \"brother soldiers\" of the Red Army to rise up and kill all of the \"Jewish commissars\".\n[25]", "Based on what they had learned during the Mogilev Conference, one Wehrmacht officer told his men \"Where the partisan is, there is the Jew and where the Jew is, there is the partisan\".\n[70] The 707th Infantry Division of the Wehrmacht put this principle into practice during an \"anti-partisan\" sweep that saw the division shoot 10,431 people out of the 19,940 it had detained during the sweep while suffering only two dead and five wounded in the process.\n[71]", "Invasion of Poland [ edit ] Wehrmacht attitudes towards Poles were a combination of contempt, fear, and a belief that violence was the best way to deal with them.\n[38] Mass murder of Polish civilians [ edit ] Wehrmacht units killed thousands of Polish civilians during the September 1939 campaign through executions and the terror bombing of cities.\nAny act of defiance was met with the most ruthless violence, although the Army leadership did seek to discourage so-called \"wild\" shootings where Wehrmacht troops would indiscriminately shoot all Poles on their own initiative.\n[38] Court martial proceedings were begun against some of the junior officers who had led these shootings, but this was nullified on 4 October 1939, when Hitler pardoned all military personnel who had been involved in war crimes in Poland.\n[38] After the end of hostilities, during the Wehrmacht's administration of Poland, which went on until 25 October 1939, 531 towns and villages were burned; the Wehrmacht carried out 714 mass executions, alongside many incidents of plunder, banditry and murder.\nAltogether, it is estimated that 16,376 Poles fell victim to these atrocities.\nApproximately 60% of these crimes were committed by the Wehrmacht.\n[39] Wehrmacht soldiers frequently engaged in the massacre of Jews on their own, rather than just assisting in rounding them up for the SS.\n[40][41]", "Michael St\u00fcrmer's geographical interpretation of German history meant that Germany's \"mission\" in Central Europe was to serve as a bulwark against the Slavic menace from the East in both World Wars.\n[184]", "German forces and Usta\u0161e collaborators lead a column of Serbs to the \u0160abac internment camp during anti-partisan \"cleansing\" operations.\nAt \u0160abac in Dulag 183, a German transit camp for POWs in World War II Serbia, which opened in September 1941 (and closed in September 1944), Partisan POWs and members of their families were held.\nIt is estimated that more than 5,000 persons were executed, not counting Jews and Roma people.\n\"Central European Jewish refugees, mostly Austrians, were shot by troops of predominantly Austrian origin in retaliation for casualties inflicted by Serbian partisans on the German Army\".\nThe orders issued by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel in September 1941 called for the German Army to shoot 100 Serbs for every German soldier killed by the Serb guerrillas and did not call for Jews to be singled out.\nDue to rampant anti-Semitism in the German officer corps, Serbian Jews were scapegoated and targeted for mass retaliatory shootings.\nGerman historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster, a leading expert on the subject of Wehrmacht war crimes, argued the Wehrmacht played a key role in the Holocaust and it is wrong to ascribe the Shoah as solely the work of the SS while the Wehrmacht were a more or less passive and disapproving bystander.\n[74]", "Such views helped to explain why 3,300,000 of the 5,700,000 Soviet POWs taken by the Germans died in captivity.\n[183] In 1992, Omer Bartov noted that the three leaders of the \"new revisionism\" in German history that sparked the Historikerstreit of the late 1980s were all in some ways seeking to promote the image of the Wehrmacht as a force for the good, and seeking to portray the Wehrmacht as a victim of the Allies rather the victimizer of the peoples of Europe, writing of \"...the bizarre inversion of the Wehrmacht's roles proposed by all three exponents of the new revisionism, whereby overtly or by implication the Army is transformed from culprit to saviour, from an object of hatred and fear to one of empathy and pity, from victimizer to victim\".\n[184] Specifically, Bartov noted that:", "Although this material was not used at the time, later in 1941 the material the psychological war laboratory had developed in 1935 was dusted off, and served as the basis not only for propaganda in the Soviet Union but also for propaganda within the German Army.\n[26] Before Barbarossa, German troops were exposed to violent anti-Semitic and anti-Slavic indoctrination via movies, radio, lectures, books and leaflets.\n[27] The lectures were delivered by \"National Socialist Leadership Officers\", who were created for that purpose, and by their junior officers.\n[27] German Army propaganda portrayed the Soviet enemy in the most dehumanized terms, depicting the Red Army as a force of Slavic Untermenschen (sub-humans) and \"Asiatic\" savages engaging in \"barbaric Asiatic fighting methods\" commanded by evil Jewish commissars to whom German troops were to grant no mercy.\n[28] Typical of the German Army propaganda was the following passage from a pamphlet issued in June 1941:", "\"The partisans are to be ruthlessly eliminated in battle or during attempts to escape\", and all attacks by the civilian population against Wehrmacht soldiers are to be \"suppressed by the army on the spot by using extreme measures, till [the] annihilation of the attackers; soldiers are to be \"suppressed by the army on the spot by using extreme measures, till [the] annihilation of the attackers; \"Every officer in the German occupation in the East of the future will be entitled to perform execution(s) without trial, without any formalities, on any person suspected of having a hostile attitude towards the Germans\", (the same applied to prisoners of war); \"If you have not managed to identify and punish the perpetrators of anti-German acts, you are allowed to apply the principle of collective responsibility.\n'Collective measures' against residents of the area where the attack occurred can then be applied after approval by the battalion commander or higher level of command\"; German soldiers who commit crimes against humanity, the USSR and prisoners of war are to be exempted from criminal responsibility, even if they commit acts punishable according to German law.\n[18][19]", "German soldiers as well as police members took pictures of Jewish executions, deportations, humiliation and the abuse to which they were also subjected.\nAccording to researchers, pictures indicate the consent of the photographers to the abuses and murders committed.\n[205] \"This consent is the result of several factors, including the anti-Semitic ideology and prolonged, intensive indoctrination\".\nArchival evidence as to the reaction to policies of racial extermination can also be traced in various letters that survived the war.\n[205] Many letters from Wehrmacht soldiers were published in 1941 and entitled \"German Soldiers See the Soviet Union\"; this publication includes authentic letters from soldiers on the Eastern front.\nTo give an example of the intensive indoctrination \"that transcends the mere results of military service\", researchers Judith Levin and Daniel Uziel quote a German soldier writing:", "In Der Arzt von Stalingrad (The Doctor from Stalingrad) of 1958, dealing with German POWs in the Soviet Union, the Germans are portrayed as more civilized, humane and intelligent than the Soviets, who are shown for the most part as Mongol savages who brutalized the German prisoners.\n[190] One of the German POWs, the dashing Doctor Sellnow (Walter Reyer), successfully seduces the beautiful and tough Red Army Captain Alexandra Kasalniskaya (Eva Bartok), who prefers him to the sadistic and hideously deformed camp commandant Piotr Markov (Hannes Messemer), which as Bartov comments is also meant to show that even in defeat, German men were more sexually virile and potent than their Russian counterparts.\n[190] This was especially important to German audiences because of the \"crisis in masculinity\" in Germany after the war, namely doubts about how manly German men were after losing the war.\n[189] Hence the exaggerated picture German films liked to show of the typical Wehrmacht soldier as an ultra-macho type who was just as much a victorious conquering hero in the bedroom as on the battlefield.\n[191]", "Only one case of rape was prosecuted by a German court during the military campaign in Poland, the case of gang rape committed by three soldiers against women of the Jewish Kaufmann family in Busko-Zdr\u00f3j; however, the German judge sentenced the guilty for Rassenschande \u2013 shame against the [German] race as defined by the racial policy of Nazi Germany \u2013 and not rape.\n[53]", "Some German officers had considered Communism in the Soviet Union to be a Jewish plot even before the Third Reich.\nIn 1918, Karl von Bothmer, the German Army's plenipotentiary in Moscow called the Bolsheviks \"a gang of Jews\" and expressed the desire \"to see a few hundred of these louts hanging on the Kremlin wall\".\n[61] Evaluations of the Red Army by the visiting Reichswehr officers during the period of German-Soviet co-operation in the 1920s often show anti-Semitism with comments about the \"Jewish slyness\" of General Lev Snitman or the \"Jewish blood\" of General Leonid Vajner being very typical.\n[61] In 1932, Ewald Banse, a leading German professor and a member of the National Association for the Military Sciences (a group secretly financed by the Reichswehr) wrote in a pamphlet calling for \"intellectual world domination\" by Germany wrote that the Soviet leadership was mostly Jewish who dominated an apathetic and mindless Russian masses.\n[62] In 1935, Colonel Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel in a report about the military capacity of the Red Army wrote that the commissars were \"mostly of the Jewish race\".\n[63]", "German soldiers photographing the hanging of Soviet citizens accused of being partisans", "Attitudes like the ones expressed above colored all the instructions that came to Wehrmacht troops in the summer of 1939 as a way of preparing for the attack on Poland.\n[13] Wehrmacht Rulings [ edit ]", "In August 1941, following the protests by two Lutheran chaplains about the massacre of a group of Jewish women and children at Byelaya Tserkov, General von Reichenau wrote:", "German Army propaganda often gave extracts in newsletters concerning the missions for German troops in the East:", "In Soviet Russia rapes were only a concern if they undermined military discipline.\n[89] Since 1941, rape was theoretically punishable with the death sentence, although rapes were rarely prosecuted in practice and rapes by Germans of non-German women were not taken seriously, nor was it punishable by death, especially in the eastern European territories.\n[86]:288 In October 1940 the laws on rape were changed, making it a \"petitioned crime\" \u2013 that is a crime for which punishment had to be requested.\nHistorian Christa Paul writes that this resulted in \"a nearly complete absence of prosecution and punishment for rape\".\n[86]:288 There were rape cases in the east where the perpetrators were sentenced if the rape was highly visible, damaging to the image of the German Army and the courts were willing to pass a condemning verdict against the accused.\n[86]:289 According to the historian Regina M\u00fchlh\u00e4user, the Wehrmacht also used sexual violence and undressing in numerous cases of interrogations.\n[95] M\u00fchlh\u00e4user adds that the number of illegitimate children born in the occupied regions did not exceed the prewar time.\nShe comes to the conclusion that rapes on the Eastern front were not singular cases but has to admit that the state of source material is very poor.\n[96]", "I'm one of those who are decreasing [the] number of partisans.\nI put them against the wall and everyone gets a bullet in his head, [a] very merry and interesting job.\n...My point of view: this nation deserves only the knaut, only by it can they be educated; a part of them already experienced that; others still try to resist.\nYesterday I had [the] possibility to see 40 partisans, something like that I had never encountered before.\nI became convinced that we are the masters, others are untermenschen.\n[206]", "In Order No.\n24 dated 24 November 1941, the commander of the 707th Division declared:", "[F]ree itself from all elements among the prisoners of war considered Bolshevik driving forces.\nThe special situation of the Eastern Campaign therefore demands special measures [an euphemism for killing] which are to be carried out free from bureaucratic and administrative influence and with a willingness to accept responsibility.\nWhile so far the regulations and orders concerning prisoners of war were based solely on military considerations, now the political objective must be attained, which is to protect the German nation from Bolshevik inciters and forthwith take the occupied territory strictly in hand.\n[16] As such, all Soviet POWs considered to be commissars together with all Jewish POWs were to be handed over to the Einsatzgruppen to be shot.\n[16] The OKW attached great importance to the killings of POWs believed to be commissars as it was believed that if the captured commissars reached POW camps in Germany that they would stage another German Stab-in-the-back myth (Dolchsto\u00df) like that believed to have caused Germany's defeat in World War I.\nBetween July\u2013October 1941, between 580,000\u2013600,000 POWs in Wehrmacht custody were turned over to the SS to be killed.\n[16] In September 1941, both Helmuth James von Moltke and Admiral Wilhelm Canaris wrote memos pointing out to the OKW that the order of July 17, 1941 was illegal under international law.\n[17]", "Commissar Order [ edit ] The order cast the war against the Soviet Union as one of ideological and racial differences, and it provided for the immediate liquidation of political commissars in the Red Army.\n[14] The order was formulated on Hitler's behalf in 1941 by the Wehrmacht command and distributed to field commanders.\n[15] General Franz Halder, contrary to what he claimed after the war, did not oppose the Commissar Order,[citation needed] and instead welcomed it writing that \"Troops must participate in the ideological battle in the Eastern campaign to the end\".\n[15] The enforcement of the Commissar Order led to thousands of executions.\nThe German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster was to write in 1989 that it was simply not true as most German Army commanders claimed in their memoirs and some German historians like Ernst Nolte were still claiming that the Commissar Order was not enforced.\n[15]", "On 3 May 1941, the Foreign Ministry of the Polish Government in Exile in London issued a document describing the mass raids carried out in Polish cities with the aim of capturing young women, who were later forced to work in brothels attended by German officers and soldiers.\n[53] In the Soviet Union women were kidnapped by German forces for prostitution; one report by the International Military Tribunal stated that \"in the city of Smolensk the German Command opened a brothel for officers in one of the hotels into which hundreds of women and girls were driven; they were mercilessly dragged down the street by their arms and hair.\n\"[110]", "Rapes [ edit ] Rapes were allowed in practice by the German military (officially forbidden, however) in eastern and southeastern Europe, while northern and western countries were relatively spared.\n[78][79] In Occupied Denmark, which initially agreed to collaborate with Nazi Germany, rapes were not widespread, and German officials promised to punish them.\n[78] By contrast thousands of Soviet female nurses, doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured, and were often murdered afterwards.\n[18] German soldiers used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women \u2013 and other women as well \u2013 with the words \"Whore for Hitler's troops\" and rape them.\n[80] Following their capture some German soldiers vividly bragged about committing rape and rape-homicide.\n[81] Susan Brownmiller argues that rape played a pivotal role in Nazi aim to conquer and destroy people they considered inferior, such as Jews, Russians, and Poles.\n[82] An extensive list of rapes committed by German soldiers was compiled in the so called \"Molotov Note\" in 1942.\nBrownmiller points out that Nazis used rape as a weapon of terror.\n[83] Examples of mass rapes in Soviet Union committed by German soldiers include:", "... rumors immediately began circulating of appalling crimes committed in the occupied territories \u2013 wholesale deportations and systematic massacres.. A story solemnly made the rounds of the world's newspapers that storks migrating from Holland to South Africa had been found with messages taped to their legs that read, \"Help us!\nThe Nazis are killing us all!\"\nSandlin, Lee (March 1997).\n\"Losing the War\".\nChicago Reader.\n[204] The attitude of German soldiers towards atrocities committed on Jews and Poles in World War II was also studied using photographs and correspondence left after the war.\nPhotographs serve as a valuable source of knowledge; taking them and making albums about the persecution of Jews was a popular custom among German soldiers.\nThese pictures are not the official propaganda of the German state but represent personal experience.\nTheir overall attitude is antisemitic.\n[205]", "In the summer of 1940, Reinhard Heydrich, the chief of the Reich Main Security Office (including the Gestapo), noted that: \"...compared to the crimes, robberies and excesses committed by the army [part of the Wehrmacht], the SS and the police don't look all that bad\".\n[42] Even when the German Army was not involved in war crimes, all of the top military leaders were aware of what was happening in Poland.\nNone objected on moral principles; the few who did object did so due to concerns about discipline.\n[38] Moreover, the general who objected the loudest to war crimes in Poland, General Johannes von Blaskowitz, was opposed to the Army committing war crimes with the SS, not the idea of atrocities against Poland.\n[43] The Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that Blaskowitiz was actually \"legitimizing murder\" by expressing approval of SS massacres while demanding that the Army be kept out of the massacres as damaging to discipline.\nBartov wrote that once officers and troops saw that murder was \"legitimate\" in Poland, the effect was that the Army tended to copy the SS.\n[44]", "Beyond that, Operation Barbarossa had been portrayed in Germany as a \"preventive war\" forced on Germany by Soviet attack alleged to be planned for July 1941.\n[172] This claim was widely believed in the Reich during the war, and indeed was so popular that as late as the 1950s some West German historians were still arguing Operation Barbarossa was a \"preventive war\".\n[172] As a result of this view of Operation Barbarossa, for many Germans, violence inflicted by the Wehrmacht on Soviet civilians and POWs was seen as something that the Soviets had brought down on themselves, hence the absence of any guilt on the part of many Germans.\n[173] Cold War priorities and taboos about revisiting the most unpleasant aspects of World War II meant that the Wehrmacht's role in war crimes was not seriously re-examined until the early 1980s.\n[174][175]", "The Wehrmacht also worked very closely with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering members of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union.\nOn October 10, 1941 General Walther von Reichenau drafted an order to be read to the troops under his command stating that: \"the soldier must achieve full understanding of the necessity for a harsh but just vengeance against Jewish subhumanity.\n\"[75] Upon hearing of Reichenau's Severity Order, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group South announced his \"complete agreement\" with it, and sent out a circular to all of the Army generals under his command urging them to send out their own versions of the Severity Order, which would impress upon the troops the need to exterminate Jews.\n[76] Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942", "At the end of the war in 1945, several Wehrmacht generals made a statement that defended the actions against partisans, the executions of hostages and the use of slave labor as necessary to the war effort.\nThe generals contended that the Holocaust was committed by the SS and its partner organizations, and that the Wehrmacht command had been unaware of these actions in the death camps.\nThe statement said that the armed forces had fought honorably and left the impression that the Wehrmacht had not committed war crimes.\n[citation needed] However, individual high-ranking Wehrmacht officers stood trial for war crimes.\nThe Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) commander-in-chief, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, and chief of operations staff Alfred Jodl were both indicted and tried for war crimes by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946.\nThey were convicted of all charges, sentenced to death and executed by hanging, although Jodl was acquitted post-mortem seven years later.\nWhile the tribunal declared that the Gestapo, SD and SS (including the Waffen-SS) were inherently criminal organizations, the court did not reach the same conclusion with respect to the Wehrmacht General Staff and High Command.\nThe accused were members of the Nazi Party itself and were executing the party's beliefs through their rank.\nThe German Wehrmacht along with Allied armies committed what are classified as war crimes.\nThe SS and political \"Armed\" groups committed what are classified as crimes against humanity.", "Ernst Nolte's argument about a \"casual nexus\" with the National Socialist genocide as a logical, if extreme response to the horrors of Communism led to Wehrmacht crimes in the Soviet Union being portrayed as essentially justified.\n[184] This was even more the case as Nolte insisted that Operation Barbarossa was as Hitler claimed a \"preventive war\", which meant that for Nolte, Wehrmacht war crimes were portrayed as a defensive response to the threat posed to Germany by the \"Asiatic hordes\".\n[184] This was even more the case as Nolte insisted that Operation Barbarossa was as Hitler claimed a \"preventive war\", which meant that for Nolte, Wehrmacht war crimes were portrayed as a defensive response to the threat posed to Germany by the \"Asiatic hordes\".\nAndreas Hillgruber's call for historians to \"identity\" and \"empathize\" with German troops fighting on the Eastern Front in 1944\u201345 implicitly devalued the lives of those suffering and dying in the Holocaust, which was allowed to continue in part because the German troops held out for so long.\n[184]", "Smolensk: German command opened a brothel for officers in which hundreds of women and girls were driven by force, often by arms and hair.\n[84] Lviv: 32 women working in a

memoirs, German Army generals claimed that the war had been a \"clean war\" on their part with the Army fighting because of the noble Prussian-German traditions, patriotism and a deep sense of honour and duty and that National Socialism had virtually no influence on the Army.\n[176] In this version, almost all German war crimes were the work of the SS and any \"excesses\" committed by the Army were only the product of a long and bitter war and were no different from Allied war crimes.\n[176] Very typical were the claims of one Infantry commander, who stated in his memoirs that all of the battles fought by his men were \"always fairly conducted, though tough and bitter.\n\"[177] Such claims were widely believed not only in Germany but abroad, with the British military historian Captain Basil Liddell Hart writing that \"the German Army in the field on the whole observed the rules of war better than in 1914\u201318\".\n[178] On 11 December 1979, the West German television show Report aired a documentary entitled \"Crimes of the Wehrmacht in World War Two\".\n[172] The public's reaction was almost overwhelmingly negative, with World War II veterans leading a campaign to have the producer of Report fired for the \"defamation\" of German soldiers.\nThis despite the fact \u2013 as the German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster was to write in 1989 \u2013 that the producers of the documentary had gone out of their way to be fair and unbiased.\n[172]", "General Erich von Manstein, in an order to his troops on 20 November 1941 stated:", "Bartov argues the need to show German soldiers as manly war heroes meant they could never be shown as war criminals.\n[191] Bartov wrote that the portrayal of the Soviet guards as mostly Asian shows disturbing affinities to war-time Nazi propaganda, where the Red Army was often described as \"the Asiatic horde\".\n[190] A recurring theme in Der Arzt von Stalingrad was that the German soldiers were being punished for crimes that they had not committed.\n[190] In the 1959 film Hunde, wolt ihr ewig leben?\n(Dogs, do you want to live forever?\n), which deals with the Battle of Stalingrad, the focus is on celebrating the heroism of the German soldiers in that battle, who are shown as valiantly holding out against overwhelming odds with no mention at all of what those soldiers were fighting for, namely National Socialist ideology or the Holocaust.\nBartov noted that the clear impression that these films give is that the average German soldier who fought on the Eastern Front was a hero worthy of the highest admiration.\n[192] This in turn led to a tendency to portray the war in the East in a manner that was devoid of its political context with the war being reduced to struggle between German soldiers whom the audiences were expected to like and admire vs. vast hordes of nameless, faceless, brutal Russian soldiers.\nIn such a narrative, war crimes by the Wehrmacht had no place.\n[193]", "The order was in line with the interests of the Wehrmacht command, which was eager to secure logistical facilities and routes behind the front line for the divisions on the Eastern Front.\n[19] On 24 May 1941, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, the head of the German Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres \u2013 OKH), slightly modified the assumptions of the \"Barbarossa Jurisdiction\".\nHis orders were to use the jurisdiction only in cases where the discipline of the army would not suffer.\n[citation needed] Contrary to what was claimed after the war, the Wehrmacht generals such as Heinz Guderian, did not intend to mitigate the records of the jurisdiction of an order, or in any way violate Hitler's intentions.\n[19] His command was intended solely to prevent individual excesses which could damage discipline within army ranks, without changing the extermination intentions of the order.\n[18] As part of the policy of harshness towards Slavic \"sub-humans\" and to prevent any tendency towards seeing the enemy as human, German troops were ordered to go out of their way to mistreat women and children in Russia.\n[31]", "Barbarossa Decree [ edit ] The background behind the Barbarossa Decree was laid out by Hitler during a high level meeting with military officials on 30 March 1941,[18] where he declared that war against Soviet Russia would be a war of extermination, in which both the political and intellectual elites of Russia would be eradicated by German forces, in order to ensure a long-lasting German victory.\nHitler underlined that executions would not be a matter for military courts, but for the organised action of the military.\n[18] The decree, issued by Field Marshal Keitel a few weeks before Operation Barbarossa, exempted punishable offenses committed by enemy civilians (in Russia) from the jurisdiction of military justice.\nSuspects were to be brought before an officer who would decide if they were to be shot.\nProsecution of offenses against civilians by members of the Wehrmacht was decreed to be \"not required\" unless necessary for the maintenance of discipline.\n[citation needed]", "In issuing orders for hostage-taking, Keitel stated that \"it is important that these should include well-known personalities or members of their families.\"\nA Wehrmacht commander in France stated that \"the better known the hostages to be shot, the greater will be the deterrent effect on the perpetrators\".\nThe Wehrmacht's hostage policy was also pursued in Greece, Yugoslavia, Scandinavia, and Poland.", "In his 2004 essay \"Celluloid Soldiers\" about post-war German films, the Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that German films of the 1950s showed the average German soldier as a heroic victim: noble, tough, brave, honourable and patriotic, while fighting hard in a senseless war for a regime that he did not care for.\n[187] The 08/15 film trilogy of 1954\u201355 concerns a sensitive young German soldier named Asch (Joachim Fuchsberger).\nNo mention is ever made of the genocidal aspects of Germany's war in the East with instead the German soldiers being shown as the victims of a war that they can not fathom the reasons for.\n[188] Bartov commented that given the intense indoctrination in the Wehrmacht about how the war against the Soviet Union was a war to destroy \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" that Asch would most definitely have known what they were fighting for.\n[188] The war on the Eastern Front was portrayed in a manner that suggested that all who fought in the war were equally victims, but since the focus in the 08/15 films is on the unit commanded by Asch inevitably the impression is given that it was German soldiers who were the primary victims of the war.\n[188] The term 8/15 refers to a type of German machine gun used in World War I that was manufactured in such quantities that 8/15 became German Army slang for anything was standard issue, which implied that Asch and the soldiers under his command were Everyman characters of the war on the Eastern Front.\n[189]", "'Citations Bibliography", "Informational notes", "Evolving analysis [ edit ]", "The leadership of the Wehrmacht rather willingly made themselves into accomplices in the policy of extermination.\nIt did this by generating the \"criminal orders\" and implementing them.\nBy no means did they merely passively support the implementation of their concept, although there was a certain reluctance for reasons of military discipline and a few isolated protests.\nTo construct a \"casual nexus\" over all this amounts in fact to steering away from the decisive responsibility of the military leadership and the bureaucratic elites.\n[179]", "In 1986, the German historian Hans Mommsen wrote about the role of the Wehrmacht under National Socialism:", "One SS man who saw the killings at Byelaya Tserkov described them as follows: I went to the woods alone.\nThe Wehrmacht had already dug a grave.\nThe children were brought along in a tractor.\nI had nothing to do with this technical procedure.\nThe Ukrainians were standing around trembling.\nThe children were taken down from the tractor.\nThey were lined up along the top of the grave and shot so that they fell into it.\nThe Ukrainians did not aim at any particular part of the body.\nThey fell into the grave.\nThe wailing was indescribable.\nI shall never forget the scene throughout my life.\nI find it very hard to bear.\nI particularly remember a small fair-haired girl who took me by the hand.\nShe too was shot later..\nThe grave was near some woods.\nIt was not near the rifle-range.\nThe execution must had taken place in the afternoon at about 3.30 or 4.00.\nIt took place the day after the discussions at the Feldkommandanten...Many children were hit four or five times before they died.\n[69]", "On 6 July 1941 Einsatzkommando 4b of Einsatzgruppe C \u2013 which was operating in Tarnopol at the time \u2013 sent a report which noted \"Armed forces surprisingly welcome hostility against the Jews\".\n[77] On 8 September 1941 Einsatzgruppe D reported that relations with the German Army were \"excellent\".\nFranz Walter Stahlecker of Einsatzgruppe A wrote in September 1941 that Army Group North had been exemplary in co-operating with his men in murdering Jews and that relations with the Fourth Panzer Army commanded by General Erich Hoepner were \"very close, almost cordial\".\n[77]", "Human experimentation [ edit ]", "Between the launching of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941 and the following spring, 2.8 million of the 3.2 million prisoners taken died while in German hands.\n[101] The German failure to attain their anticipated victory in the East led to significant shortages of labor for German war production and, beginning in 1942, prisoners of war in the eastern POW camps \u2013 primarily Soviets \u2013 were seen as a source of slave labor to keep Germany's wartime economy running.\n[101] On 6 August 1941, the OKW declared that Soviet POWs capable of work were to receive 2,200 calories/day and those not capable of work 2,040 calories/day.\n[102] On 21 October 1941, the OKW ordered a huge reduction in the food rations for Soviet POWs, with POWs incapable of work henceforth to receive only 1,490 calories/day.\nIn a meeting of senior generals called at Or\u0161a on 13 November 1941, the Army's First quarter-master General Eduard Wagner stated \"Non-working prisoners of war in the camps are to starve\".\n[103]", "Widespread plunder and theft [ edit ] Throughout the campaign Wehrmacht engaged in widespread theft and plunder of Polish citizens' property.\n[54] Until 3 November 1939 the Wehrmacht sent to the Nazi Germany 10,000 train wagons with stolen property including agricultural machinery, furniture and food.\n[55][56]", "The Muslim POWs were shot because they were circumcised, and therefore might be Jewish; it was felt to be safer to simply shoot all circumcised POWs rather run the risk that a Jewish POW might escape execution by claiming to be a Muslim.\n[99] Reflecting the close co-operation between the Wehrmacht and the SS was an Einsatzgruppen report, which read: In Borispol, following a demand by the Commandant of the local P/W camp, a platoon of Sonderkommando 4 shot 752 Jewish prisoners of war on 14 October and 356 on 16 October 1941 including several commissars and 78 wounded Jews handed over by the camp medical officer.\n[99] According to a RHSA report of 5 December 1941, the Wehrmacht had since 22 June handed over to the Einsatzgruppen 16, 000 Soviet POWs to be \"liquidated\".\n[100] A Typical of the Wehrmacht's treatment of Soviet POWs were the reports of the 11th Army commanded by Erich von Manstein on the \"wastage\" rates in the first half of 1942.\nAccording to the reports:[100]", "It is necessary to eliminate the red sub-humans, along with their Kremlin dictators.\nGerman people will have a great task to perform the most in its history, and the world will hear more about that this task will be completed till the end.\n[29]", "See also [ edit ] References [ edit ]", "When the National Socialists (Nazis) came to power, it was welcomed by almost the entire officer corps of the Reichswehr as a way of creating the Wiederwehrhaftmachung (remilitarization) of Germany, namely the total militarization of German society in order to ensure that Germany did not lose the next war.\n[11] As such, what both the Nazis and the German Army wanted to see was a totally militarized Volksgemeinschaft that would be purged of those perceived internal enemies like the Jews who it was believed had \"stabbed Germany in the back\" in 1918.\n[12] Many officers therefore willingly embraced National Socialist ideology in the 1930s.\nActing on his own initiative, the Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg had purged the Army of all its Jewish personnel in February 1934.\n[12] On December 8, 1938, the Army leadership had instructed all officers to be thoroughly well versed in National Socialism and to apply its values in all situations.\nStarting in February 1939, pamphlets were issued that were made required reading

soldiers started during the September 1939 Poland campaign.\nIn many cases large groups of Polish soldiers were murdered after capture.\nHitler's Commando Order, issued in 1942, provided \"justification\" for the shooting of enemy commandos, whether uniformed or not.\n[citation needed] The massacres include that of at least 1500 black French POWs of West African origin and was preceded by propaganda depicting the Africans as savages.\n[105] From October 1942 onwards, the Wehrmacht carried out the 'Commando Order' calling for the summary execution of all captured commandos, even if in uniform.\nAfter the Italian armistice in 1943, many POWs were executed on several occasions when Italian troops resisted their forcible disarmament by the Germans.\nThe massacre of the Acqui Division at Kefalonia is the most infamous.\nOn 26 March 1944, 15 uniformed US Army officers and men were shot without trial at La Spezia, in Italy, after orders of the commander of the German 75th Army Corps, General Anton Dostler, despite the opposition of his subordinates of the 135th Fortress Brigade.\nDostler was sentenced to death by an American military tribunal and executed by

political officers.\nOn 10 June, the Gestapo chief Heinrich M\u00fcller issued an order on the segregation of prisoners and ordered that commissars be isolated from the rest of the prisoners and sent to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.\nHowever, this did not change the plight of commissars much, as Mauthausen was one of the worst Nazi concentration camps where they usually waited for a slow death.\nOn 20 October 1942, M\u00fcller again ordered commissars captured in battle to be shot on the spot.\nOnly those commissars who were identified as deserters were sent to Mauthausen.\nIn the following months reports continued to be filed regarding the executions of Soviet commissars.\n[18] The last known account of the liquidation of a political officer came from units of Army Group South in July 1943.\n[18]", "Author Ursula Schele, estimated in the Journal \"Zur Debatte um die Ausstellung Vernichtungskrieg.\nVerbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941-1944\" that one in ten women raped by German soldiers would have become pregnant, and therefore it is probable, while not provable, that up to ten million women in the Soviet Union could have been raped by the Wehrmacht.\n[88]:9 Birgit Beck, in her work Rape: The Military Trials of Sexual Crimes Committed by Soldiers in the Wehrmacht, 1939\u20131944, describes the leniency in punishing sex crimes by German authorities in the East, at the same time pointing out heavy punishments applied in the West.\n[89] If a soldier who committed a rape was subsequently convicted by a court-martial, he would usually be sentenced to four years in prison[90] The German penal code was also valid for soldiers in war.\n[91] However, until 1944 only 5,349 soldiers of the Wehrmacht on all fronts were sentenced because of indecency offence \"Sittlichkeitsvergehen\" or rape \"Notzucht\".\n[92] Historian M\u00fchlh\u00e4user believed that sexual assault was not an exception but common, and that the actual number of rapes committed by German soldiers are without question much greater.\n[93] Other sources estimate that rapes of Soviet women by the Wehrmacht range up to 10,000,000 incidents, with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children being born as a result.\n[86][87][88][94]", "The order specified:", "Bartov also wrote that German film-makers liked to show the heroic last stand of the 6th Army at Stalingrad, but none has so far showed the 6th Army's massive co-operation with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering Soviet Jews in 1941 during its march across the Ukraine.\n[197] Likewise, Bartov commented that German films tended to dwell on the suffering of the 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad and its aftermath without reflecting on the fact that it was the Germans who invaded the Soviet Union and that the Russians were fighting to defend their country.\n[197] Bartov went on to state that as late as the 1991 film Mein Krieg (My War), featuring interview footage of six German veterans juxtaposed with their amateur films the veterans shot during the war, contains strong hints that the interviewees saw and/or were involved in war crimes with at one point a mass grave of civilians in Russia being glimpsed in the background of one of the amateur films; but the point is not pressed by the film-makers.\n[198]", "Only with Jenseits des Krieges (released in the US as East of War) in 1996, a documentary directed by Ruth Beckermann dealing with the public's reaction to the exhibition \"War of Extermination\" in Vienna in 1995, did a German film admit to Wehrmacht war crimes being commonplace instead of an exception to the rule.\n[199] Some veterans in Jenseits des Krieges denied that the German Army committed any war crimes at all while others express relief at long last that the truth has been told.\n[200] One critic wrote of the veterans in Jenseits des Krieges that \"Some are sorry for their brutality, while others rationalize such acts as shooting POWs, raping women and butchering Jewish people as part of what soldiers were expected to do\".\n[201]", "Bartov wrote that all three historians had in varying ways sought to justify and excuse Wehrmacht war crimes by depicting the Wehrmacht as engaging in a heroic battle for Western civilization, often using the same language as the Nazis such as referring to the Red Army as the \"Asiatic hordes\".\n[184] Bartov ended that these sorts of arguments reflected a broader unwillingness of the part of some Germans to admit to what their Army did during the war.\n[184] In 1998, J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster, a German historian, wrote that for too long most people have accepted at face value the self-serving claims made by generals like Erich von Manstein and Siegfried Westphal who promoted the idea of the Wehrmacht in their memoirs as a highly professional, apolitical force who were victims of Adolf Hitler rather than his followers.\n[185] F\u00f6rster argues the Wehrmacht played a key role in the Holocaust in Eastern Europe and other war crimes.\n[186] In 1999, New Zealand historian Christian Leitz wrote that the claims promoted after the war that the Wehrmacht had been an \"untarnished shield\" with the Army somehow standing apart from the regime it served so loyally was a \"myth\" that no serious historian had taken seriously since the 1980s.\n[174][175]", "Films [ edit ]", "In the summer of 1941, the SS Cavalry Brigade commanded by Hermann Fegelein during the course of \"anti-partisan\" operations in the Pripyat Marshes killed 699 Red Army soldiers, 1,100 partisans and 14,178 Jews.\n[64] Before the operation, Fegelein had been ordered to shoot all adult Jews while driving the women and children into the marshes.\nAfter the operation, General Max von Schenckendorff, who commanded the Army Group Centre Rear Area ordered on 10 August 1941 that all Wehrmacht security divisions when on anti-partisan duty were to emulate Fegelein's example and organized between 24\u201326 September 1941 in Mogilev, a joint SS-Police-Wehrmacht seminar on how best to murder Jews.\n[64] The seminar, which became known as the Mogilev Conference, ended with the 7th Company of Police Battalion 322 of the Order Police shooting 32 Jews at a village called Knjashizy before the assembled officers as an example of how to \"screen\" the population for partisans.\n[70] As the war diary of the Battalion 322 read: The action, first scheduled as a training exercise was carried out under real-life conditions (ernstfallm\u00e4ssig) in the village itself.\nStrangers, especially partisans could not be found.\nThe screening of the population, however resulted in 13 Jews, 27 Jewish women and 11 Jewish children, of which 13 Jews and 19 Jewish women were shot in co-operation with the Security Service.\n[70]", "In September 1944 the garrison of Brest executed civilians and looted and destroyed civilian property during the Battle for Brest.\nThe commander of the garrison,

condition of the patients would be photographed by Kaschub every few days and liquid from their wounds collected.\nThe probable motive for those experiments was to find out how soldiers made

Wehrmacht in the Soviet Union massacred Jews.\nCo-operation with the SS in anti-partisan and anti-Jewish operations was close and intensive.\n[64] In the spring of 1941, Heydrich and General Eduard Wagner successfully completed negotiations for co-operation between the Einsatzgruppen and the German Army to allow the implementation of \"special tasks\".\n[65] Following the Heydrich-Wagner agreement on 28 April 1941, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch ordered when Operation Barbarossa began that all German Army commanders were to identify and register all Jews in the occupied areas in the Soviet Union at once and to co-operate fully with the Einsatzgruppen.\nEach Einsatzgruppe, in its area of operations, was under the control of the Higher SS and Police Leaders.\n[66] In a further agreement between the Army and the SS concluded in May 1941 by General Wagner and Walter Schellenberg, it was agreed that the Einsatzgruppen in front-line areas were to operate under Army command while the Army would provide the Einsatzgruppen with all necessary logistical support.\n[67]", "The conclusion of the report in question contains the following sentence, \"In the case in question, measures against women and children were undertaken which in no way differ from atrocities carried out by the enemy about which the troops are continually being informed\".\nI have to

both German states needed to establish armed forces and could not do so without trained officers and soldiers that had served in the Wehrmacht.\nGerman historiography in the 1950s viewed war crimes by German soldiers as exceptional rather than ordinary; soldiers were seen as victims of the Nazi regime.\nTraces of this attitude can still be seen in some German works today, which minimize the number of soldiers who took part in Nazi crimes.\n[171] This was especially the case as the German public in the immediate post-war period were more interested in seeing themselves rather than others as victims.\n[172] Thus the subject of Red Army atrocities against German civilians in 1944\u201345 received vastly more popular and historical interest in the 1950s than did the subject of Wehrmacht atrocities against Soviet civilians in 1941\u201344.\n[172]", "Anyone who has ever looked into the face of a Red commissar knows what the Bolsheviks are.\nThere is no need here for theoretical reflections.\nIt would be an insult to animals if one were to call the features of these, largely Jewish, tormentors of people beasts.\nThey are the embodiment of the infernal, of the personified insane hatred of everything that is noble in humanity.\nIn the shape of these commissars we witness the revolt of the subhuman against noble blood.\nThe masses whom they are driving to their deaths with every means of icy terror and lunatic incitement would have brought about an end of all meaningful life, had the incursion not been prevented at the last moment;\" [the last statement is a reference to the \"preventive war\" that Barbarossa was alleged to be].\n[26]", "The same month, 9th Infantry Division massacred Black soldiers of the 4th North African Infantry Division they had captured near Erquivillers.\nA German officer is cited in French reports as explaining \"an inferior race does not deserve to do battle with a civilized race such as the Germans.\n\"[59]", "Date Died/shot Escaped Handed over", "Deliberate bombing of civilians [ edit ] In one of the Germany military's first acts of World War II the German air force, the Luftwaffe, bombed the Polish town of Wielu\u0144 and later went on to bomb cities across the country, including Warsaw, Frampol and various other cities.\nCollectively the bombings killed tens of thousands of Polish civilians.\nHowever, no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed prior to and during World War II[45] which means that at the time, strategic bombings were not officially war crimes.\nFor this reason, no German officers were prosecuted at the post-World War II Allied war crime trials for aerial raids.\n[46]", "(he was not a member of the SS).\nHe performed experiments on the limbs of middle-aged and young prisoners;
