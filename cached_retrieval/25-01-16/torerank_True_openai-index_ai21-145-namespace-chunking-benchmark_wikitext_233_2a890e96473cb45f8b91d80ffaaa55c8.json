["After the 1903 destruction of the original wooden bridge at Belvidere, plans to construct another bridge started immediately.\nAfter the storm, the substructure of the crossing had survived the strong storm.\nThe bridge corporation set a completion date, August 17, 1904, which was the day that the Farmer's Picnic was held in Belvidere.\nHowever, the contractor of which they hired to reconstruct the bridge, the New Jersey Bridge Company of Manasquan, New Jersey, believed that the new bridge would need new abutments and piers to be completed by that time, instead of using the old wooden bridge's piers.\nThe three piers from the wooden bridge were used, and would require them to be heightened to be above any high flood waters.", "The bridge was constructed fast, and when completed in the spring of 1836, it was a wooden covered bridge at a length of 654 feet (199 m).\nWithin days of opening the bridge, on April 9, 1836, a storm blew through the valley, destroying two of the bridges three piers and rendered the new bridge unusable.\nAfter restarting construction later, the bridge was redone using the same piers and in 1839, was completed and opened once again.\nHowever, in January 1841, another storm, dubbed the Bridges Freshet of January 1841, blew through the valley, destroying most of the bridges in the area, and causing major damage to the structure from Riverton to Belvidere.", "That year, the Belvidere Delaware Bridge Company was established by both the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\nHowever, in constructing the bridge, the company was only allowed $20,000 (1832 USD) to construct the bridge.\nThe bridge company had the designs for the bridge run by Solon Chapin, a contractor from Easton, Pennsylvania.\nChapin was also the construction contractor on the nearby Riegelsville Bridge as well.\nAlthough things seemed to start off smoothly, when construction began on the bridge in 1834, things went downhill.", "The bridge survived two large storms in 1836 and 1841, although sustained major damage both times.\nIn 1903, the floods that destroyed bridges along the Delaware River Valley, including taking out the entire covered structure at Riverton and Belvidere.\nThey rebuilt the structure in 1904, using steel instead of wood, and the new span has remained since, with rehabilitations at certain points.", "With the bridge now under the control of the toll bridge commission, extensive repairs began on the 25-year-old structure.\nThis construction included new beams for the bridge, new flooring, and an extensive repair to one bridge pier.\nAlthough the construction had only taken four months to complete, it still caused havoc in commuting across the structure.\nIn 1940, the Pennsylvania approach to the bridge was designated as Pennsylvania Route 709, a designation that would last six years, being decommissioned in 1946.\nThe structure would face its most recent strength test in 1955, after the massive flooding from Hurricane Diane wreaked havoc in the area.", "The bridge corporation and a local group called The Red Men scheduled festivities and the official turnover of the bridge back to the corporation.\nOn September 5, 1904, the day of the transfer, the chief executive of the contracting company, W.H.\nKeepers arrived, he found the bridge to be unacceptable.\nBolts were missing in places of the bridge and paint was not completed, both of which were in violation of the contract.\nThe festivities for the bridge were canceled, and visitors were disappointed.\nThe Red Men held events, but the turnout was light.\nA high point of the events that day was done by a man named Murphy Jones, who as a stunt, jumped a 65-foot (20 m) plunge into the Delaware River from the bridge.", "The storm struck both communities, and the bridge in between, causing the loss of many lives, and on October 17, the toll collector on the bridge closed off the gate and did not allow any person to cross.\nAt 6:40 that evening, a crash was heard, and seconds later, the bridge was no more, after tumbling into the Delaware River below.\nRemnants of the bridge were swept downstream, and smashed on the side of the new Northampton Street Bridge, constructed just a few years before.", "However, this time, the bridge survived the storm.\nA local historian stated that because of the constant repairwork on the bridge itself, the bridge company had never paid one dividend of money to its stockholders.\nAlthough, after society on both sides of the bridge began to live life with it, money started flowing into the accounts of the stockholders.\nIn 1903, the demise of wooden covered bridge would be seen, as a storm, dubbed the Pumpkin Flood of 1903, struck in October of that year.", "Original reports indicate that a ferry, operated by a doctor who went by 'Dr.\nBelvidere', once ran along the alignment of the Riverton-Belvidere Bridge.\nThis ferry, crossing one of the most dangerous parts of the Delaware, was reported to have opened as early as 1802.\nOn May 17, 1825, the Board of Chosen Freeholders of the ferry permitted raising the rate to cross the river via ferry.\nHowever, by 1832, the ferry crossing was becoming dangerously busy, and required a bridge be constructed in its place.", "Work finally came to a conclusion in 1904, and the people were beginning to cross the new structure.\nHowever, since the turnover had never occurred, the bridge was free of charge.\nOn September 5, 1904, the bridge finally got its transfer to the bridge corporation, and a new toll-taker was hired for the new bridge.\nAfter this, life went back to normal in both communities.\nIn October 1928, after the charter and opening of the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, the bridge company was asked to sell the bridge to the commission for $60,000 (1928 USD), and on June 14, 1929, the commission abolished tolls along the bridge, making it free to cross at either end.", "The structure received minor damage in the flood, and the traffic was only halted for a day or two afterward.\nThe design in the 1904 plan worked, as the structure was not at flood level.\nStarting in October 2006, the Toll Bridge Commission began an $8.8 million rehabilitation of the structure.\nThe rehabilitation helped extend the life of the bridge for years rather than shutting the bridge down constantly for the next 15 years for major repairs.\nThe Commission replaced the flooring, repairing or replacing of certain steel portions of the bridge, blast-cleaning and repainted the structure.", "The bridge was first constructed in 1836, replacing the local ferry across the river.\nThe board of freeholders in Warren County supported the replacement of the ferry with a bridge for safety of passengers.\nIn 1832, the state created the Belvidere Delaware Bridge Company, which was funded with the job of building a bridge from Riverton to Belvidere.\nThe new covered bridge was built by Solon Chapin, a contractor from Easton, Pennsylvania.", "On June 3, 1904, the bridge construction began on a barge in the river, with promises to be complete by the set date of August 17.\nOn August 17, the bridge was not complete, but usable, that when the Farmer's Picnic (the predecessor to the Warren County Fair, occurred, people were allowed to cross a majority of the bridge.\nThe picnic itself was a complete success, attracting over 15,000 people, most of which walked the bridge.\nAlthough the bridge was usable, work still had to be completed on the new bridge.\nThe contractor promised the bridge corporation that the bridge would be finished by Labor Day of 1904, or September 5, 1904.", "After the storm cleared, the community of Belvidere put a ferry to Riverton back in almost immediately.", "The Riverton-Belvidere Bridge is a bridge crossing the Delaware River.\nIt connects Belvidere, New Jersey with Riverton, Pennsylvania, United States.\nThere is no toll for crossing on either side, after tolls were abolished by the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges in 1929.\nThe bridge is 653 feet (199 m) long, holding a load of 8 short tons (16,000 lb) of traffic from County Route 620 Spur (Water Street) in Belvidere to former Pennsylvania Route 709 on the Riverton side.", "As well as one depicting the Crucifixion, there is an arrangement of St Catherine and St Margaret on either side of, and facing, a man standing on a bridge: the bridge is over water full of fish, and the man has an angel on either side of his head, and is being attacked by a lion to his left on the bridge, and a dragon to his right.\nWork continued under Juyner's successors to the eve of the Dissolution.\nThe last building work to be completed was the remodelling of the gatehouse, performed after 1510, though as late as 1534 the monks were engaged in a major project of renewing the cloister walks in the latest fashion.\nAs at the neighbouring house of Forde Abbey, this was never completed, due to the dissolution of the abbey.", "tured K'iche' lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city.\nAfter the destruction of Q'umarkaj and the execution of its rulers, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K'iche' resistance.\nAlvarado wrote that they sent 4000 warriors to assist him, although the Kaqchikel recorded that they sent only 400.", "The USAF and the British RAF began bombing Belgrade indiscriminately in April 1944 when they thought that Nazi occupation could not be removed by home-grown resistance alone.\nThe United States intelligence circles gradually conceded its influence on Yugoslav guerrilla operations to the British.\nAt the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman dedicated a Legion of Merit to Chetnik leader Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107, but the award wasn't revealed publicly until 2005.", "In 1535, the abbey's income was only assessed at \u00a3155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances.\nIt meant the following year that it came under the terms of the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\nAbbot William Dovell and his 16 monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536.\nThere were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, it was not to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537.", "One of Pani\u0107's advisors, academic Ljubi\u0161a Raki\u0107, was dispatched to explain to Larry Eagleburger that the H.W.\nBush administration was mistaken in seeing Pani\u0107

lands.\nAccording to Alvarado's letter to Cort\u00e9s, the Pipil came back to the town and submitted to him, accepting the king of Spain as their overlord.\nThe Spanish force camped in the captured town for eight days.\nA few years later, in 1529, Pedro de Alvarado was accused of using excessive brutality in his conquest of Izcuintepeque, amongst other atrocities.", "A major source of income was the export of wool.\nHowever, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a worsening economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt.\nThe internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400\u201301 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region.\nHowever, things improved in the fifteenth century and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.", "Alvarado described the terrain approaching the town as very difficult, covered with dense vegetation and swampland that made the use of cavalry impossible; instead he sent men with crossbows ahead.\nThe Pipil withdrew their scouts because of the heavy rain, believing that the Spanish and their allies would not be able to reach the town that day.\nHowever, Pedro de Alvarado pressed ahead and when the Spanish entered the town the defenders were completely unprepared, with the Pipil warriors indoors sheltering from the torrential rain.\nIn the battle that ensued, the Spanish and their indigenous allies suffered minor losses but the Pipil were able to flee into the forest, sheltered from Spanish pursuit by the weather and the vegetation.", "In the late 17th century the small population of Ch'ol Maya in southern Pet\u00e9n and Belize

mixture of persuasion and force.\nKowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed.\nIts leaders were executed and most of the mission towns were abandoned.\nBy 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet\u00e9n, compared to ten times that number in 1697.\nAlthough disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.", "Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies.\nPedro de Portocarrero led the second attempt with a large infantry detachment but was unable to engage with the enemy due to the difficult mountain terrain, so returned to Nancintla.\nAlvarado sent out Xinca messengers to make contact with the enemy but they failed to return.\nMessengers from the city of Pazaco, in the modern department of Jutiapa, offered peace to the conquistadors but when Alvarado arrived there the next day the inhabitants were preparing for war.\nAlvarado's troops encountered a sizeable quantity of gathered warriors and quickly routed them through the city's streets.", "This ended up severely damaging Pani\u0107's unique diplomatic position internationally, as well as his standing in Yugoslavia.\nThe Los Angeles Times published an article which described Pani\u0107 as a doubtful upholder

to break through the pass and storm the entrance of the city.\nThe Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their allies.\nThose who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city.\nThe siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.", "In response a punitive expedition was launched, headed by Juan Matalbatz, a Q'eqchi' leader from Chamelco; the independent Indians captured by the Q'eqchi' expedition were taken

directly by the Spanish and their descendents ( the criollos ) or was tightly controlled by them.\nThe introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism.\nOld World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups, an example being the marimba, a musical instrument of African origin.\nThe greatest change was the sweeping aside of the pre-Columbian economic order and its replacement by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of game.\nNew crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour.", "Following the

from the Kaqchikels, souring the friendship between the two peoples.\nHe demanded that their kings deliver 1000 gold leaves, each worth 15 pesos.\nA Kaqchikel priest foretold that the Kaqchikel gods would destroy the Spanish, causing the Kaqchikel people to abandon their city and flee to the forests and hills on 28 August 1524 (7 Ahmak in the Kaqchikel calendar).\nTen days later the Spanish declared war on the Kaqchikel.\nTwo years later, on 9 February 1526, a group of sixteen Spanish deserters burnt the palace of the Ahpo Xahil, sacked the temples and kidnapped a priest, acts that the Kaqchikel blamed on Pedro de Alvarado.\nConquistador Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo recounted how in 1526 he returned to Iximche and spent the night in the \"old city of Guatemala\" together with Luis Mar\u00edn and other members of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's expedition to Honduras.\nHe reported that the houses of the city were still in excellent condition; his account was the last description of the city while it was still inhabitable.\nThe Spanish founded a new town at nearby Tecp\u00e1n Guatemala; Tecp\u00e1n is Nahuatl for \"palace\", thus the name of the new town translated as \"the palace among the trees\".\nThe Spanish abandoned Tecp\u00e1n in 1527, because of the continuous Kaqchikel attacks, and moved to the Almolonga Valley to the east, refounding their capital on the site of today's San Miguel Escobar district of Ciudad Vieja, near Antigua Guatemala.\nThe Nahua and Oaxacan allies of the Spanish settled in what is now central Ciudad Vieja, then known as Almolonga (not to be confused with Almolonga near Quetzaltenango); Zapotec and Mixtec allies also settled San Gaspar Vivar about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) northeast of Almolonga, which they founded in 1530.\nThe Kaqchikel kept up resistance against the Spanish for a number of years, but on 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops, the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds.\nA day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja.\nThe former inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed; some were moved to Tecp\u00e1n, the rest to Solol\u00e1 and other towns around Lake Atitl\u00e1n.", "The Kaqchikel appear to have entered into an alliance with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz'utujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan.\nPedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan at the request of the Kaqchikel lords, both of whom were killed by the Tz'utujil.\nWhen news of the killing of the messengers reached the Spanish at Iximche, the conquistadors marched against the Tz'utujil with their Kaqchikel allies.\nPedro de Alvarado left Iximche just 5 days after he had arrived there, with 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors.\nThe Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's hard march, without encountering any opposition.\nSeeing the lack of resistance, Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore.\nOpposite a populated island the Spanish at last encountered hostile Tz'utujil warriors and charged among them, scattering and pursuing them to a narrow causeway across which the surviving Tz'utujil fled.\nThe causeway was too narrow for the horses, therefore the conquistadors dismounted and crossed to the island before the inhabitants could break the bridges.\nThe rest of Alvarado's army soon reinforced his party and they successfully stormed the island.\nThe surviving Tz'utujil fled into the lake and swam to safety on another island.\nThe Spanish could not pursue the survivors further because 300 canoes sent by the Kaqchikels had not yet arrived.\nThis battle took place on 18 April.\nThe following day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted.\nPedro de Alvarado camped in the centre of the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy.\nThey managed to catch some locals and used them to send messages to the Tz'utujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain.\nThe Tz'utujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche.\nThree days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors.\nA short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain, although Alvarado did not name them in his letters; they confirmed Kaqchikel reports that further out on the Pacific plain was the kingdom called Izcuintepeque in Nahuatl, or Panatacat in Kaqchikel, whose inhabitants were warlike and hostile towards their neighbours.", "The church and infirmary have almost

unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival.\nTaxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards.\nBecause Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca

Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco.\nMany indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses.\nThis was a serious setback and

difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult.\nThe population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact.\nBy the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because of the effects of the Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.", "From 1527 onwards the Spanish were increasingly active in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, establishing a number of colonies and towns by 1544, including Campeche and Valladolid in what is now Mexico.\nThe Spanish impact on the northern Maya, encompassing invasion, epidemic diseases and the export of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, caused many Maya to flee southwards to join the Itza around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, within the modern borders of Guatemala.\nThe Spanish were aware that the Itza Maya had become the centre of anti-Spanish resistance and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their trade routes over the course of almost two hundred years.\nThe Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the slow Spanish advance.\nDominican missionaries were active in Verapaz and the southern Pet\u00e9n from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success.\nIn the 17th century the Franciscans came to the conclusion that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1.\nThe constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the encomiendas.\nFray Bartolom\u00e9 de Fuensalida visited Nojpet\u00e9n in 1618 and 1619.\nThe Franciscan missionaries attempted to use their own reinterpretation of the k'atun prophecies when they visited Nojpet\u00e9n at this time, to convince the current Aj Kan Ek' and his Maya priesthood that the time for conversion had come.\nBut the Itza priesthood interpreted the prophecies differently, and the missionaries were fortunate to escape with their lives.\nIn 1695 the colonial authorities decided to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucat\u00e1n, and Guatemalan soldiers conquered a number of Ch'ol communities, the most important being Sakb'ajlan on the Lacant\u00fan River in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon.\nThe Franciscan friar Andr\u00e9s de Avenda\u00f1o oversaw a second attempt to overcome the Itza in 1695, convincing the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord.\nHowever the Itza had local Maya enemies who resisted this conversion, and in 1696 Avenda\u00f1o was fortunate to escape with his life.\nThe Itza's continued resistance had become a major
