["Recreational fishermen are allowed to catch lobsters with hoop nets or by SCUBA diving or free-diving; almost all come from California, with only small numbers from other U.S. states.\nThe California Department of Fish and Game estimates that recreational fishers caught more than 200,000 spiny lobsters in the first half of the 2008/2009 season, amounting to around 280,000 pounds (130,000 kg), compared to commercial fishermen, who caught a total of 580,000 lb (260,000 kg) in the same time.\nThe California Department of Fish and Game sets and enforces a number of regulations pertaining to recreational fishing of spiny lobsters: Open season for California spiny lobster runs from the Saturday before the first Wednesday in October until the first Wednesday after March 15.\nNo implements other than hoop nets may be used; no one person may have more than 5 nets and no vessel may use more than 10 hoop nets.\nWhen fishing from land, each fisherman is limited to two hoop nets.\nLobster fishers may not land more than seven California spiny lobsters on any given day, and may not have more than seven in their possession at any time.\nFishers must carry a lobster gauge, and any lobster smaller than the minimum landing size must be returned to the sea immediately.\nThe minimum size is a carapace length of 3 1\u00be inches (82.6 mm), measured along the midline from the rear of the eye socket between the horns, to the end of the carapace.\nThis is equivalent to a total body length of 20 centimeters or 7.9 inches.\nTo fish for spiny lobster south of Point Arguello, a sport fishing license with ocean enhancement stamp must be displayed or kept nearby.\nA report card for the season must be bought, filled in and returned before April 30 after the season ends.\nCommercial and recreational traps must not be interfered with.", "In Mexico, spiny lobsters are an important commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US $18 million.\nThree species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744 t of the California spiny lobster makes up 95% \u2013 97% of the total, with only small quantities of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus gracilis.\nThe fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.\nThe main legal restrictions on fishing for California spiny lobster in Mexico are a minimum landing size of 82.5 mm (3.25 in), the prohibition of catching berried females, and a closed season: from February 16 to November 15, fishing for spiny lobsters is prohibited in a region which moves south along Mexico's Pacific coast during the season.\nThe Mexican fishery for the California spiny lobster was the first Latin American fishery to be awarded the Marine Stewardship Council's sustainable fishery ecolabel, and the species is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.", "The open season for commercial fishing begins on the first Wednesday in October and runs until the first Wednesday after the 15th of March.\nCommercial fishermen may use individually buoyed traps, but may not dive for lobsters.\nFor those using lobster traps, the fishing effort is greatest at the beginning of the permitted season in California, and peters out towards the end of the season, 24 weeks later.\nAlthough the fishing effort becomes better concentrated on areas with more spiny lobsters during the season, the fishing efficiency (catch per unit effort) nonetheless decreases throughout the season.", "The California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) is a species of spiny lobster found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Monterey Bay, California to the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico.\nIt typically grows to a length of 30 cm (12 in) and is a reddish-brown color with stripes along the legs, and has a pair of enlarged antennae but no claws.\nThe interrupted grooves across the tail are characteristic for the species.\nFemales can carry up to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 weeks into flat phyllosoma larvae.\nThese feed on plankton before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state.\nAdults are nocturnal and migratory, living among rocks at depths of up to 65 m (213 ft), and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms.\nThe spiny lobster is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can defend itself with a loud noise produced by its antennae.\nThe California spiny lobster is the subject of both commercial and recreational fishery in both Mexico and the United States, with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using lobster traps.", "California spiny lobsters are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, with only the tips of their long antennae showing, as a means of avoiding predators.\nTowards dawn, the spiny lobsters form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk.\nAt night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms.\nThis activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.\nNatural predators of the California spiny lobster include bony fish such as the California sheepshead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks including the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters.\nIn response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument.\nThe bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file on the edge of the antennular plate.\nIf a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.\nThere is an annual migration, in which spiny lobsters enter shallower water in spring and summer, and head out to deeper water in fall and winter, reaching depths as great as 240 ft (73 m), perhaps to avoid the effects of winter storms.", "In common with all spiny lobsters, the California spiny lobster has two large, spiny antennae, but no large claws on its legs.\nThe California spiny lobster is one of the largest spiny lobster species, and grows up to 60 centimeters (24 in) long, but does not usually exceed 30 cm (12 in).\nMales can weigh up to 7.4 kilograms (16 lb)., with the record being a 16 lbs., 1 oz.\nmale caught off Catalina island in 1968.\nThe upper side of the animal is brownish red, without the paler bands or spots seen in some other spiny lobsters.\nThe legs are a similar color, but with one or more lighter streaks running along their length.\nMales and females of all ages can be distinguished by the position of the two round genital openings or gonopores.\nIn females, they are at the bases of the third pair of pereiopods, while in males they are at the base of the fifth (last) pereiopods, furthest from the head and the closest to the abdomen.\nMature females have a small claw on the fifth pereiopod, and enlarged pleopods.", "In his original description, John Witt Randall noted that the California spiny lobster is \"used as food by the natives\" of Upper California.\nThe California spiny lobster is now the most economically important lobster on the American West Coast.\nSport fishing may account for up to half the entire catch, while most of the commercial catch comes from lobster traps, with smaller amounts coming from the use of trammel nets or by trawling.\nThe major fishing area is west of Baja California, and imports from Mexico to the United States are twice the amount produced in California.", "The California spiny lobster can be differentiated from the other species in the genus by the interrupted grooves across the abdomen; other species either lack grooves, or have grooves which span the entire body segment.\nHybrid Theory is the debut album by the American rock band Linkin Park, released on October 24, 2000 through Warner Bros. Records.\nThe album was a commercial success, having been certified Diamond for sales of over 11 million units in the United States alone as of 2010, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, and also reaching high positions on other charts worldwide.", "The California spiny lobster is found in parts of the Gulf of California, and along the Pacific coast of the length of the Baja California peninsula, extending as far north as San Luis Obispo Bay, California.\nThere are occasional records from Monterey Bay, but the water there is too cold for the California spiny lobster to breed, and it is thought that any adult found in Central California arrived as a larva during El Ni\u00f1o years.\nCalifornia spiny lobsters live on rocky substrates, at depths of up to 65 meters (213 ft).\nAlthough they can be found in shallow water, including tide pools, they are more frequent in deeper waters.\nJuveniles generally inhabit rocky habitats at a depth of 0 \u2013 4 m (0 \u2013 13 ft) with dense plant cover, especially the surf grass Phyllospadix torreyi.", "Although originally placed in the genus Palinurus, the California spiny lobster was later transferred to Adam White's new genus Panulirus, together with other spiny lobsters that have long flagella on their first antennae.\nThe California spiny lobster is one of 19 species in the genus Panulirus, which is one of several genera of spiny lobsters whose names are anagrams of the original spiny lobster genus, Palinurus.\nIts closest relatives are not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather Panulirus argus from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus marginatus, Panulirus pascuensis, Panulirus cygnus and Panulirus longipes; this relationship has been recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S ribosomal RNA genes.", "Female California spiny lobsters reach sexual maturity at a length of 65 \u2013 69 millimeters (2.6 \u2013 2.7 in), which is typically at an age of 5 \u2013 9 years; males are sexually mature after 3 \u2013 6 years.\nBecause all the hard parts are lost at each molt, the life span of mature spiny lobsters is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.\nSpiny lobsters do not have the gonopods (first pleopods modified for reproduction) that occur in clawed lobsters and crabs, and females do not have a deep pocket on the sternum in which to store sperm.\nInstead, a spermatophore is transferred directly from one of the male's gonopores to the sternum of the female.\nThe male gonopore is, however, adorned with a \"penile process\", which is straight and serrated, with a small \"hairbrush\".\nThe sternum of mature females has three \"windows\" on the last three segments, which uniquely among Panulirus species, span both halves of the sternum.\nThese windows are softer than the rest of the exoskeleton, and are thought to help the male locate the correct location to place the tar-like spermatophore.\nAfter mating, the fertilized eggs are carried on the female's pleopods until they hatch, with between 120,000 and 680,000 carried by a single female.\nThe eggs begin coral red, but darken as they develop to a deep maroon.\nWhen she is carrying the eggs, the female is said to be \"berried\".\nThe eggs are ready to hatch after 10 weeks, and spawning takes place from May to August, The larvae that hatch (called phyllosoma larvae) do not resemble the adults.\nInstead, they are flat, transparent animals around 14 mm (0.55 in) long, but as thin as a sheet of paper.\nThe larvae feed on plankton, and grow through ten molts into ten further larval stages, the last of which is around 30 \u2013 32 mm (1.2 \u2013 1.3 in) long.\nThe full series of larval molts takes around 7 months, and when the last stage molts, it metamorphoses into the puerulus state, which is a juvenile form of the adult, albeit still transparent.\nThe puerulus larvae settle to the sea floor when the water is near its maximum temperature, which in Baja California is in the fall.\nThe diet of the juveniles is varied, but comprises mostly amphipods and isopods, together with coralline algae and the plant Phyllospadix.\nWhen available, the juveniles prefer to eat crabs.", "The music video won the Best Rock", "Panulirus interruptus is called the California spiny lobster by the Food and Agriculture Organization, but a number of other local, vernacular names exist, including California lobster, California marine crayfish, and red lobster in the United States, and langosta colorada and langosta roja in Mexico.\nThe preferred common name of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is simply spiny lobster.\nJohn Witt Randall described the species in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia in 1840, based on material given to him by Thomas Nuttall.\nThe exact locality is not known, being given only as \"Upper California\", but the most likely sources are the places where Nuttall was most active, namely Santa Barbara and San Diego.\nThe specific epithet interruptus refers to the grooves on the abdominal tergites, which are interrupted in this species.", "Although aware that historians had criticized the witch @-@ cult hypothesis of Margaret Murray, Martello stood by her claims, believing that the cult had been passed through oral tradition and thus evaded appearing in the textual sources studied by historians.\nMartello thought it unimportant that many Wiccans had lied about the origins of their beliefs, being quoted by Pagan journalist Margot Adler in her book Drawing Down the Moon as having stated \" Let 's assume that many people lied about their lineage.\nLet 's further assume that there are no covens on the current scene that have any historical basis.\nThe fact remains : they do exist now.\nAnd they can claim a spiritual lineage going back thousands of years.\nAll of our pre @-@ Judeo @-@ Christian or Moslem ancestors were Pagans ! \"", "This concept is echoed in the music video, in which a girl (Katelyn Rosaasen) is abused by her father and can be seen in the beginning of the video with several visible bruises.\n'Papercut' was the album's third single, and its lyrics describe paranoia.\nThe music video for 'Papercut' features the band performing in a hallway opposite a completely dark room on the walls of which are scribbled the song's lyrics.", "Inspired by his victory over the Parks Department, Martello founded an organization devoted to campaigning for the religious rights of Witches, the Witches Anti @-@ Defamation League ( WADL ), which would eventually be renamed the Alternative Religions Education Network ( AREN ).\nFor WADL, he authored an essay titled \" The Witch Manifesto \", likely influenced by Carl Wittman 's \" Refugees from Amerika : A Gay Manifesto \" ( 1970 ), which demanded that the Roman Catholic Church face a tribunal for crimes committed against accused witches in the Early Modern period and that they pay reparations to the modern Witchcraft community for those actions.", "Martello defended the growing rise of feminists in Wicca during the 1970s, criticizing what he deemed as the continual repression of women within the Pagan movement.\nHe also espoused the view that any Pagan who was involved in the U.S. government or military was a hypocrite.\nHe was critical of Wiccans who espoused a division between white magic and black magic, commenting that it had racial overtones and that many of those advocating such a view were racist.", "The first step was a precise characterization of the error in the main mirror.\nWorking backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant of the mirror as built was1.01390 \u00b1 0.0002, instead of the intended1.00230.\nThe same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, as well as by analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror.", "In 1999, after Wakefield's departure, lead vocalist Chester Bennington joined the five members Xero and the band was renamed to Linkin Park.\nBennington's previous band, Grey Daze, had recently disbanded, so his lawyer recommended him to Jeff Blue, vice president of A&R coordination for Zomba, who at the time was seeking a lead vocalist for Xero.\nBlue sent Bennington two tapes of Xero's unreleased recordings \u2014 one with vocals by former Xero member Mark Wakefield, and the other with only the instrumental tracks \u2014 asking for his 'interpretation of the songs'.", "The music video for 'One Step Closer' was shot in a Los Angeles subway and became an instant hit, eventually receiving heavy rotation on MTV and other music television networks.\nStand-in bassist Scott Koziol is shown performing with the band in the video.\nThe second single was 'Crawling'.\nLyrically, the song focuses on Bennington's personal experiences with child abuse \u2014 the physical violence, the difficulty in breaking the cycle of abuse, and the subsequent loss of self-esteem.", "Despite initial difficulties in finding a producer willing to take charge of the debut album of a newly signed band, Don Gilmore ultimately agreed to head up the project, with Andy Wallace hired as the mixer.\nRecording sessions, which mostly involved re-recording the songs off the demo tape, began at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California in early 2000 and lasted four weeks.\nShinoda's rapping sections in most of the songs were significantly altered from the original, while most choruses remained largely unchanged.", "The song's concept is mainly based on one person's failure.\nIt is considered symbolic of an ending relationship, however, it can also represent broken trust in a once long-lasting friendship.\nThe music video for 'In the End' was shot at various stops along the 2001 Ozzfest tour and was directed by Nathan 'Karma' Cox and the band's DJ Joe Hahn, who would go on to direct many of Linkin Park's future videos (the two also directed the music video for 'Papercut').", "Various supernatural themes are present in the video, and special effects are used to create eerie renditions, such as the 'stretching' of Shinoda's fingers and the 'melting' of Bourdon's face.\nThe fourth single to come from Hybrid Theory was 'In the End', which prominently features a signature piano riff performed by Shinoda.\nHis rapping also dominates the verses of the song and is later joined by Bennington's vocals in the chorus.", "While 'In the End' was the most successful of the four, all of the singles in the album remain some of the band's most successful songs to date.\nAlthough 'Runaway', 'Points of Authority', and 'My December' from the special edition bonus disc album were not released as singles, they were minor hits on alternative rock radio stations thanks to the success of all of the band's singles and the album.\nAt the 2002 Grammy Awards, Hybrid Theory was nominated for Best Rock Album.\nThe album is listed in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\nIt was ranked #11 on Billboard's Hot 200 Albums of the Decade.", "The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.\n=== Origin of the problem === A commission headed by Lew Allen, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was established to determine how the error could have arisen.\nThe Allen Commission found that the main null corrector, a

during this point to tour with Tasty Snax).", "This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.\nThe effect of the mirror flaw on scientific observations depended on the particular observation \u2014 the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss.\nHowever, the loss of light to the large, out of

explain them.\nAmong its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain the value of the Hubble constant, the measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding, which is also related to its age.\nBefore the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of \u00b1 10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques.\nThe estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.\nWhile Hubble helped to refine estimates of the age of the universe, it also cast doubt on theories about its future.\nAstronomers from the High-z Supernova Search Team and the Supernova Cosmology Project used ground-based telescopes and HST to observe distant supernovae and uncovered evidence that, far from decelerating under the influence of gravity, the expansion of the universe may in fact be accelerating.\nThe cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood; the most common cause attributed is dark energy.\nThe high-resolution spectra and images provided by the HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies.\nWhile it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at the centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies.\nThe Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related.\nThe legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.\nThe collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming just a few months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance.\nHubble images of the planet were sharper than any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.\nOther discoveries made with Hubble data include proto-planetary disks (proplyds) in the Orion Nebula; evidence for the presence of extrasolar planets around Sun-like stars; and the optical counterparts of the still-mysterious gamma ray bursts.\nHST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System, including the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris.\nA unique window on the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, which used Hubble's unmatched sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths.\nThe images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new window on the early Universe.\nThe Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery of some of the most distant objects yet discovered, such as MACS0647-JD.\nThe non-standard object SCP 06F6 was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in February 2006.\nDuring June and July 2012, US astronomers using Hubble discovered a tiny fifth moon moving around icy Pluto.\nIn March 2015, researchers announced that measurements of aurorae around Ganymede revealed that the moon has a subsurface ocean.\nUsing Hubble to study the motion of its aurorae, the researchers determined that a large saltwater ocean was helping to suppress the interaction between Jupiter's magnetic field and that of Ganymede.\nThe ocean is estimated to be 100 km (60 mi) deep, trapped beneath a 150 km (90 mi) ice crust.\nOn December 11, 2015, Hubble captured an image of the first-ever predicted reappearance of a supernova, dubbed \"Refsdal\", which was calculated using different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose gravity is warping the supernova's light.", "During this decade he authored a column for Gnostica magazine which was titled \" Wicca Basket \", a pun on the phonetic similarity

advance the knowledge of early galaxy formation by studying high-redshift galaxies in blank fields with the help of gravitational lensing to see the \"faintest galaxies in the distant universe.\"\nThe Frontier Fields web page describes the goals of the program being: to reveal hitherto inaccessible populations of z = 5 \u2013 10 galaxies that are 10 to 50 times fainter intrinsically than any presently known, to solidify our understanding of the stellar masses and star formation histories of sub-L* galaxies at the earliest times, to provide the first statistically meaningful morphological characterization of star forming galaxies at z > 5, to find z > 8 galaxies stretched out enough by cluster lensing to discern internal structure and/or magnified enough by cluster lensing for spectroscopic follow-up.", "Servicing Mission 3A, flown by Discovery, took place in December 1999, and was a split-off from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed.\nThe fourth failed a few weeks before the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations.\nThe mission replaced all six gyroscopes, replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets.\nThe new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than the DF-224 it replaced.\nIt increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft, and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.", "Performing on a studio stage allowed Hahn and Cox to set off water pipes above the stage near the end and drench the band.", "The music of Hybrid Theory draws from diverse

Deftones, Guns N' Roses, U2, and The Smiths.\nMike Shinoda's rapping, present in seven tracks, is very close to The Roots' style.\nThe lyrical content of the songs primarily touches upon the problems that Bennington encountered during his childhood, including child abuse, constant and excessive drug and alcohol abuse, the divorce of his parents, isolation, disappointments, and the aftermath feelings of failed relationships.", "One rather complex task that falls to STScI is scheduling observations for the telescope.\nHubble is in a low-Earth orbit to enable servicing missions, but this means that most astronomical targets are occulted by the Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit.\nObservations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly due to elevated radiation levels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations of Mercury), Moon and Earth.", "Tracking northwestward parallel to the Mexican coast, the system became better organized on August 22, though later that day its structure deteriorated.\nOn August 23, a strong area of convection developed and persisted near a circulation center, despite strong wind shear.\nWith banding features becoming more prominent, the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) classified the system as Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E about 345 miles ( 555 km ) south @-@ southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.\nThe tropical depression initially moved northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a ridge over Mexico.", "During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror, Perkin-Elmer analyzed its surface with two conventional null correctors.\nHowever, for the final manufacturing step (figuring), they switched to a custom-built null corrector, designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances.\nThe incorrect assembly of the device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape.\nThere was one later opportunity to catch the error, since for technical reasons a few of the final tests needed to use the two conventional null correctors.", "While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.\n=== Design of a solution === The design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993.", "Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.", "Five servicing missions (SM 1, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4) were flown by NASA space shuttles, the first in December 1993 and the last in May 2009.\nServicing missions were delicate operations that began with maneuvering to intercept the telescope in orbit and carefully retrieving it with the shuttle's mechanical arm.\nThe necessary work was then carried out in multiple tethered spacewalks over a period of four to five days.\nAfter a visual inspection of the telescope, astronauts conducted repairs, replaced failed or degraded components, upgraded equipment, and installed new instruments.\nOnce work was completed, the telescope was redeployed, typically after boosting to a higher orbit to address the orbital decay caused by atmospheric drag.", "Tropical Storm Julio was a tropical storm that made landfall on the southern tip of Baja California Sur in August 2008.\nThe tenth named storm of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season, it developed from a tropical wave on August 23 off the coast of Mexico.\nIt moved parallel to the coast, reaching peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) before moving ashore and weakening.\nOn August 26 it dissipated in the Gulf of California.\nJulio was the third tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Pacific Ocean basin during the season, after Tropical Storm Alma, which struck Nicaragua in May, and Tropical Depression Five @-@ E, which moved ashore along southwestern Mexico in July.", "In the early 1980s, NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss Key Projects.\nThese were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, which would be explicitly dedicated to each project.\nThis guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed sooner than expected.\nThe panels identified three such projects: 1) a study of the nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies; 2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3) a project to determine the Hubble Constant within ten percent by reducing the errors, both external and internal, in the calibration of the distance scale.", "There is no direct successor to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible-light space telescope, as near-term space telescopes do not duplicate Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands.\nThese bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe.\nThese wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying the expense of a space-based telescope.\nLarge ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.\nPlans for a Hubble successor materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which culminated in plans for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble.\nVery different from a scaled-up Hubble, it is designed to operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened.\nIt is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft.\nA main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments.\nIt is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects.\nThe telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket.\nAlthough JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600 nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum.\nA typical human eye can see to about 750 nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.\nA complementary telescope, looking at even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009.\nLike JWST, Herschel was not designed to be serviced after launch, and had a mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter.\nIt needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.\nFurther concepts for advanced 21st-century space telescopes include the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope, a conceptualized 8- to 16-meter (320- to 640-inch) optical space telescope that if realized could be a more direct successor to HST, with the ability to observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the Spitzer Space telescope.\nThis effort is being planned for the 2025 \u2013 2035 time frame.\nExisting ground-based telescopes, and various proposed Extremely Large Telescopes, can exceed the HST in terms of sheer light-gathering power and diffraction limit due to larger mirrors, but other factors affect telescopes.\nIn some cases, they may be able to match or beat Hubble in resolution by using adaptive optics.\nHowever, AO on large ground-based reflectors will not make Hubble and other space telescopes obsolete.\nMost AO systems sharpen the view over a very narrow field \u2014 Lucky Cam, for example, produces crisp images just 10\" to 20\" wide, whereas Hubble's cameras are super sharp across a 2 \u00bd' (150\") field.\nFurthermore, space telescopes can study the universe across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, most of which is blocked by Earth's atmosphere.\nFinally, the background sky is darker in space than on the ground, because air absorbs solar energy during the day and then releases it at night, producing a faint \u2014 but nevertheless discernible \u2014 airglow that washes out low-contrast astronomical objects.", "Hubble data can be analyzed using many different packages.\nSTScI maintains the custom-made Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System (STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, as well as many other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data.\nThe software runs as a module of IRAF, a popular astronomical data reduction program.", "The position along its orbit changes over time in a way that is not accurately predictable.\nThe density of the upper atmosphere varies according to many factors, and this means that Hubble's predicted position for six weeks' time could be in error by up to 4,000 km (2,500 mi).\nObservation schedules are typically finalized only a few days in advance, as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance that the target would be unobservable by the time it was due to be observed.\nEngineering support for HST is provided by NASA and contractor personnel at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, 48 km (30 mi) south of the STScI.", "The Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) system was designed to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS.\nIt consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration.\nTo fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, one of the other instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed.\nBy 2002, all of the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics.", "In 1923, Hermann Oberth\u2014considered a father of modern rocketry, along with Robert H. Goddard and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky\u2014published Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen (\"The Rocket into Planetary Space\"), which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled into Earth orbit by a rocket.\nThe history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced back as far as 1946, to the astronomer Lyman Spitzer's paper \"Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory\".\nIn it, he discussed the two main advantages that a space-based observatory would have over ground-based telescopes.", "Spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope.\nIn 1962, a report by the US National Academy of Sciences recommended the development of a space telescope as part of the space program, and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.\nSpace-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following World War II, as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in rocket technology.", "Many objective measures show the positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy.\nOver 9,000 papers based on Hubble data have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings.\nLooking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no citations, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations.\nOn average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data.\nOf the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.\nAlthough the HST has clearly helped astronomical research, its financial cost has been large.\nA study on the relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on HST data generate 15 times as many citations as a 4 m (13 ft) ground-based telescope such as the William Herschel Telescope, the HST costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain.\nDeciding between building ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex.\nEven before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based techniques such as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble.\nSince then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects.\nThe usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked.\nIn the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field.\nOnly a small fraction of astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast, Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.", "To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984.\nThe mirror was completed by the end of 1981; it was washed using 2,400 gallons (9,100 L) of hot, deionized water and then received a reflective coating of 65 nm-thick aluminum and a protective coating of 25 nm-thick magnesium fluoride.\nDoubts continued to be expressed about Perkin-Elmer's competence on a project of this importance, as their budget and timescale for producing the rest of the OTA continued to inflate.\nIn response to a schedule described as 'unsettled and changing daily', NASA postponed the launch date of the telescope until April 1985.", "Tropical Storm Julio quickly weakened over land, although it initially maintained strong convection near its center.\nBy early on August 26, however, the low @-@ level and upper @-@ level circulations separated, with the upper @-@ circulation continuing quickly northeastward into mainland Mexico; the low @-@ level circulation slowed as it entered the Gulf of California, after having been separated from its deep convection.\nLater in the day, the NHC discontinued advisories after the storm failed to maintain enough organized convection to be considered a tropical cyclone.", "Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high-resolution images, with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes.\nHubble has recorded some of the most detailed visible-light images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time.\nMany Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the universe.\nThe HST was built by the United States space agency NASA, with contributions from the European Space Agency.\nThe Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the Goddard Space Flight Center controls the spacecraft.", "The storm brought locally heavy rainfall to southern Baja California, killing one person and leaving several towns isolated.\nMoisture from Julio reached Arizona, producing thunderstorms, including one which damaged ten small planes in Chandler.\nOn August 20, a tropical wave became discernible about 800 miles ( 1300 km ) off the coast of Mexico, which in the next day developed a large area of convection, or thunderstorms.\nInitially, conditions were unfavorable for development, due to strong upper @-@ level wind shear.", "The Hubble Space Telescope celebrated its 20th anniversary in space on April 24, 2010.\nTo commemorate the occasion, NASA, ESA, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) released an image from the Carina Nebula.\nTo commemorate Hubble's 25th anniversary in space on April 24, 2015, STScI released images of the Westerlund 2 cluster, located about 20,000 light-years (6,100 pc) away in the constellation Carina, through its Hubble 25 website.\nThe European Space Agency created a dedicated 25th anniversary page on its website.", "All images from Hubble are monochromatic grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate a variety of filters each sensitive to specific wavelengths of light.\nColor images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters.\nThis process can also create false-color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.", "Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited to take full advantage of the space environment.\nTherefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10 nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light.\nOn the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind \u2014 for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15 \u00b0 C) temperatures by heaters.\nThis limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.", "Congress eventually approved funding of US $36 million for 1978, and the design of the LST began in earnest, aiming for a launch date of 1983.\nIn 1983 the telescope was named after Edwin Hubble, who made one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century when he discovered that the universe is expanding.", "Plans called for Hubble to be serviced in February 2005, but the Columbia disaster in 2003, in which the orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program.\nNASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that all future shuttle missions had to be able to reach the safe haven of the International Space Station should in-flight problems develop.\nAs no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future manned service missions were canceled.\nThis decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk.\nHST's planned successor, the James Webb Telescope (JWST), is not expected to launch until at least 2018.\nA gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor is of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST.\nThe consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only makes these concerns more acute.\nOn the other hand, many astronomers felt strongly that the servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were to come from the JWST budget.\nIn January 2004, O'Keefe said he would review his decision to cancel the final servicing mission to HST due to public outcry and requests from Congress for NASA to look for a way to save it.\nThe National Academy of Sciences convened an official panel, which recommended in July 2004 that the HST should be preserved despite the apparent risks.\nTheir report urged \"NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope\".\nIn August 2004, O'Keefe asked Goddard Space Flight Center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission.\nThese plans were later canceled, the robotic mission being described as \"not feasible\".\nIn late 2004, several Congressional members, led by Senator Barbara Mikulski, held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support (including thousands of letters from school children across the country) to get the Bush Administration and NASA to reconsider the decision to drop plans for a Hubble rescue mission.\nThe nomination in April 2005 of a new NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background, Michael D. Griffin, changed the situation, as Griffin stated he would consider a manned servicing mission.\nSoon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions.\nIn October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by Atlantis was scheduled for October 2008.\nHubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008, halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008.\nSince a failure of the backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit.\nServicing Mission 4, flown by Atlantis in May 2009, was the last scheduled shuttle mission for HST.\nSM4 installed the replacement data-handling unit, repaired the ACS and STIS systems, installed improved nickel hydrogen batteries, and replaced other components.\nSM4 also installed two new observation instruments \u2014 Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) \u2014 and the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System, which will enable the future rendezvous, capture, and safe disposal of Hubble by either a crewed or robotic mission.\nExcept for the High Resolution Channel of the ACS which was unable to be repaired, the work accomplished during SM4 rendered the telescope fully functional, and it remains so as of 2015.", "These tests correctly reported spherical aberration, but were dismissed since the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate.\nThe commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer.\nRelations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns.\nNASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror.", "The continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal.\nIn 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission.\nOnce these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope.", "Additionally, some of the science instruments and components had their own embedded microprocessor-based control systems.\nThe MATs (Multiple Access Transponder) components, MAT-1 and MAT-2, utilize Hughes Aircraft CDP1802CD microprocessors.\nThe Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC) also utilized an RCA 1802 microprocessor (or possibly the older 1801 version).\nThe WFPC-1 was replaced by the WFPC-2 during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which was then replaced by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) during Servicing Mission 4 in 2009.", "The instrument contained eight charge-coupled device (CCD) chips divided between two cameras, each using four CCDs.\nEach CCD has a resolution of 0.64 megapixels.\nThe 'wide field camera' (WFC) covered a large angular field at the expense of resolution, while the 'planetary camera' (PC) took images at a longer effective focal length than the WF chips, giving it a greater magnification.\nThe GHRS was a spectrograph designed to operate in the ultraviolet.\nIt was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve a spectral resolution of 90,000.", "Astronomical data taken with CCDs must undergo several calibration steps before they are suitable for astronomical analysis.\nSTScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available.\nThis 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned.\nThe process by which data are calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories.\nAstronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally.\nThis may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.", "Since the start of the program, a number of research projects have been carried out, some of them almost solely with Hubble, others coordinated facilities such as Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESO's Very Large Telescope.\nAlthough the Hubble observatory is nearing the end of its life, there are still major projects scheduled for it.\nOne example is the upcoming Frontier Fields program, inspired by the results of Hubble's deep observation of the galaxy cluster Abell 1689.", "The OSO and OAO missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy, and in 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based reflecting telescope with a mirror 3 m in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979.\nThese plans emphasized the need for manned maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable space shuttle indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.", "These events inspired Martello 's desire to hold a public Witchcraft Sabbat celebration.\nActing under the auspices of WICA, in late summer he approached the New York City Parks Department asking for permission to hold a \" Witch @-@ In \" in Sheep Meadow, at the south end of Central Park, on October 31, 1970.\nThe Department refused, and when Martello stated that the Witchcraft community would gather there regardless in their capacity as private individuals, he was threatened with police action.\nMartello gained the legal assistance of the New York Civil Liberties Union ( NYCLU ), who informed the Parks Department that they were in breach of the First Amendment.\nThe Department subsequently reversed their decision, and the event went ahead.", "COSTAR was removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum.\nThe area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.\n=== Servicing missions and new instruments === Hubble was designed to accommodate regular servicing and equipment upgrades.", "Servicing Mission 3B flown by Columbia in March 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument, with the FOC (which, except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry, was the last of the original instruments) being replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).\nThis meant that COSTAR was no longer required, since all new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration.\nThe mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed-cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power.", "The funding issues led to something of a reduction in the scale of the project, with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3 m to 2.4 m, both to cut costs and to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware.\nA proposed precursor 1.5 m space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped, and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the European Space Agency.\nESA agreed to provide funding and supply one of the first generation instruments for the telescope, as well as the solar cells that would power it, and staff to work on the telescope in the United States, in return for European astronomers being guaranteed at least 15% of the observing time on the telescope.", "Anyone can apply for time on the telescope; there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation, but funding for analysis is only available to US institutions.\nCompetition for time on the telescope is intense, with about one-fifth of the proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on the schedule.\nCalls for proposals are issued roughly annually, with time allocated for a cycle lasting about one year.\nProposals are divided into several categories; \"general observer\" proposals are the most common, covering routine observations.\n\"Snapshot observations\" are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time, including overheads such as acquiring the target.\nSnapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in the telescope schedule that cannot be filled by regular GO programs.\nAstronomers may make \"Target of Opportunity\" proposals, in which observations are scheduled if a transient event covered by the proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle.\nIn addition, up to 10% of the telescope time is designated \"director's discretionary\" (DD) time.\nAstronomers can apply to use DD time at any time of year, and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae.\nOther uses of DD time have included the observations that led to views of the Hubble Deep Field and Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and in the first four cycles of telescope time, observations that were carried out by amateur astronomers.", "HST's guidance system can also be used as a scientific instrument.\nIts three Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but can also be used to carry out extremely accurate astrometry; measurements accurate to within 0.0003 arcseconds have been achieved.", "Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice.\nTo reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.\nWhile construction of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the construction of the OTA, Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer of 1985, construction of the spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule.", "The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990, and remains in operation.\nAlthough not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy.\nThe HST is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nWith a 2.4-meter (7.9 ft) mirror, Hubble's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared spectra.", "Once the Space Telescope project had been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions.\nMarshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission.\nMSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope.", "All Hubble data is eventually made available via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at STScI, CADC and ESA/ESAC.\nData is usually proprietary \u2014 available only to the principal investigator (PI) and astronomers designated by the PI \u2014 for one year after being taken.\nThe PI can apply to the director of the STScI to extend or reduce the proprietary period in some circumstances.\nObservations made on Director's Discretionary Time are exempt from the proprietary period, and are released to the public immediately.\nCalibration data such as flat fields and dark frames are also publicly available straight away.\nAll data in the archive is in the FITS format, which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use.\nThe Hubble Heritage Project processes and releases to the public a small selection of the most striking images in JPEG and TIFF formats.", "This costly situation (about $6 million per month) pushed the overall costs of the project even higher.\nThis delay did allow time for engineers to perform extensive tests, swap out a possibly failure-prone battery, and make other improvements.\nFurthermore, the ground software needed to control Hubble was not ready in 1986, and in fact was barely ready by the 1990 launch.\nEventually, following the resumption of shuttle flights in 1988, the launch of the telescope was scheduled for 1990.\nOn April 24, 1990, shuttle mission STS-31 saw Discovery launch the telescope successfully into its planned orbit.", "Hubble data was initially stored on the spacecraft.\nWhen launched, the storage facilities were old-fashioned reel-to-reel tape recorders, but these were replaced by solid-state data storage facilities during servicing missions 2 and 3A.\nAbout twice daily, the Hubble Space Telescope radios data to a satellite in the geosynchronous Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), which then downlinks the science data to one of two 60-foot (18-meter) diameter high-gain microwave antennas located at the White Sands Test Facility in White Sands, New Mexico.\nFrom there they are sent to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, and finally to the Space Telescope Science Institute for archiving.\nEach week, HST downlinks approximately 140 gigabytes of data.", "NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists wanted it to be based in an academic establishment.\nThe Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), established at Garching bei M\u00fcnchen near Munich in 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre.", "From its original total cost estimate of about US $400 million, the telescope had by now cost over $2.5 billion to construct.\nHubble's cumulative costs were estimated to be about US $10 billion in 2010, twenty years after launch.\n=== Flawed mirror === Within weeks of the launch of the telescope, the returned images indicated a serious problem with the optical system.\nAlthough the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected.", "Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS, which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble.\nRather than CCDs these three instruments used photon-counting digicons as their detectors.\nThe FOC was constructed by ESA, while the University of California, San Diego, and Martin Marietta Corporation built the FOS.\nThe final instrument was the HSP, designed and built at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison.\nIt was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of variable stars and other astronomical objects varying in brightness.", "The telescope is operating as of 2016, and could last until 2030-2040.\nIts scientific successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), is scheduled for launch in 2018."]
