rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series, as may be seen on the Orkney Mainland, where a narrow strip of the older rock is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, and again on the small island of Graemsay.\nMiddle Devonian basaltic volcanic rocks are found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay.\nCorrelation between the Hoy volcanics and the other two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain.\nLamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney.\nGlacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands.\nBoulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas.\nThe geology of Shetland is quite different.\nIt is extremely complex, with numerous faults and fold axes.\nThese islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny and there are outcrops of Lewisian, Dalriadan and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland.\nThere are also small Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions.\nThe most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor.\nMuch of Shetland's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas.\nGeological evidence shows that at around 6100 BC a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slides hit the Northern Isles, (as well as much of the east coast

release) have different graphical appearances.\nThe game over screen in the English version features the silhouette of Ganon from the chest up, with the text saying 'Game Over / Return of Ganon', whereas the FDS game over screen is a plain black screen with the text saying 'Return of Ganon / The End'.\nThere are some slight additions to the dungeons, as well as a handful of differences on the dungeons themselves.\nDue to an additional soundchip that the Disk System has, when Nintendo ported Zelda II over to the NES they had to eliminate some musical elements, especially from the title screen.\nOn the main map, the icons denoting attacking monsters look different, but the most significant change is the spending of experience points, as Link's three attributes cost the same, unlike the worldwide release.\nFurther, the game is designed to promote balanced leveling, as the saved game on the disk will only let the levels for the attributes go as high as whatever is set the lowest (e.g.\nif Life is at 5 and Strength is at 4, but Magic is at 1, then the saved game will reflect all as level 1), while still saving the data regarding crystals that have been placed and items that have been collected.\nThese differences make leveling up in the game very different.\nThe Adventure of Link was re-released in 2003 on the The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition disc for the GameCube, and again in 2004 as part of the \u201cClassic NES Series\u201d for Game Boy Advance, with changes.\nThe intro text has been changed to read 'third Triforce' rather than 'No.3 Triforce' and the copyright date has been altered to read '1987- 2004'.\nThe death animation removed flashing colors in an effort to prevent seizures, replacing it with a solid red color.\nThere were also various graphical and audio tweaks.\nIt was released as the 100th title on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on January 23, 2007, in Europe and Australia on February 9, 2007 and was released in North America on June 4, 2007.\nThe text changes weren't made in this version, but it does feature the solid red color in the death animations from the GameCube and Game Boy Advance versions.\nThe game was released yet again in September 2011 on Virtual Console (this time on the 3DS), bundled with its predecessor as part of a free giveaway of 10 original Nintendo Entertainment System games to 3DS owners who purchased the console before the price drop.\nIt is now available to purchase on the Nintendo eShop for the 3DS and Wii U.\nThe 3DS version is a direct port of the original NES release and, consequently, features the flashing color death scene and none of the text alterations of previous re-releases.\nAlthough the game features the save option, fully resetting the software currently results in the save game being deleted, meaning that the user should not do this unless that is the desired outcome.", "Ajax entered talks with Middlesbrough over signing Mido on a free transfer in

introduced in this game have remained in the series.\nFor instance, non @-@ player characters (NPCs) were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited.\nStarting with The Adventure of Link, Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link's quests.\nZelda II was also one of the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world a life of its own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold.\nThe use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games.\nThe Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of Link and plays an important role in later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with Link.\nDark Link is a version of Link's Shadow which appears in Ocarina of Time, a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in Four Swords Adventures, and yet another appears in Spirit Tracks, as well as in A Link Between Worlds.\nAdditionally, The Adventure of Link was one of the first games to combine role @-@ playing video game and platforming elements to a considerable degree.\nOver the next few years, a number of Japanese @-@ made games appeared with a similar format; major titles such as Cadash (1989) closely resemble The Adventure of Link, with side @-@ scrolling platform stages supplemented by RPG @-@ like statistical systems, weapons, armor, magic spells, and so forth.\nMost of the sages in Ocarina of Time bear the same names as towns from The Adventure of Link (Rauru, Ruto, Saria, Nabooru, and Darunia; excluding Impa).\nAnother town, Mido, is also the name of a character in Kokiri Forest.\nHowever, in the in @-@ game chronology, the towns were named after the characters.\nThe Adventure of Link is also the only Zelda game of the main English releases not to use \" The Legend of Zelda \" in its title, the only Zelda game to feature \" lives \" counting down, and therefore the only game in the series to include 1 @-@ up dolls.\nThe next Zelda game released after The Adventure of Link was The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the Super Famicom in 1991, which follows new Link and Zelda characters and returns to the top @-@ down style of the original.\nIt is officially considered a prequel to the NES games, and as of 2016 there has been no technical plot sequel to The Adventure of Link, with each Zelda game being either a prequel or a \" sequel to a prequel \".\nThere are a small number of side scrolling areas in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening; these areas were mainly underground tunnels and caves.\nThe series broke away from the top @-@ down style again in 1998 when Ocarina of Time was released on the Nintendo 64, with 3D graphics.\nA new version of the composition \" Temple \", arranged by Shogo Sakai, is featured in Super Smash Bros. Melee, where it is played during the \" Hyrule Temple \" stage and the \" Underground Maze \" level.\nA variation of the track, as well as a new version of the 'Grand Palace' level song, also appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.\nThe track was later once again updated and appeared twice, as the \" Streetpass Battle Theme \" as well as a slower version for the \" Battle Victory \" music, in the Nintendo 3DS Zelda game A Link Between Worlds, making it the only subsequent Zelda game to include theme music that originated in The Adventure of Link.\nThe Streetpass battle mode is itself inspired by the final boss fight of Zelda 2, and Streetpass fights occur between the player as Link, and the other player as Shadow / Dark Link.\nThe 3DS title Adventure Time: Hey Ice King!\nWhy'd You Steal Our Garbage?\n!", "Honours as

strange mark on the back of his left hand, exactly like the crest of Hyrule.\nHe seeks out Impa, who responds by taking Link to the North Castle, where a door has been magically sealed for generations.\nImpa places the back of Link's left hand on the door, and it opens, revealing a sleeping maiden.\nImpa tells Link that the maiden is Zelda (not the Zelda from the first game), the princess of Hyrule from long ago, and the origin of the 'Legend of Zelda'.\nZelda's brother had tried to force her into telling their recently deceased father's secrets concerning the last of three sacred golden triangle treasures of his kingdom, known collectively as the Triforce.\nPrincess Zelda refused to reveal its location, and the prince's wizard friend, in anger, tried to strike her down with a spell.\nZelda fell under a powerful sleeping spell, but the wizard was unable to control the wildly arcing magic and was killed by it.\nThe prince, filled with remorse and unable to reverse the spell, had his sister placed in the castle tower, in the hope that she would one day be awakened.\nHe decreed that princesses born to the royal family from that point on would be named Zelda, in remembrance of this tragedy.\nImpa says that the mark on Link's hand means that he is the hero chosen to awaken Zelda.\nShe gives Link a chest containing six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read.\nLink finds that he can read the document, even though he has never seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule.\nThis will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage.\nOnly the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda.\nTaking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces.\nMeanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link; sprinkling his blood on Ganon\u2019s ashes will bring Ganon back to life.\nUltimately, Link restores the crystals to the six palaces, defeating a strong guardian within each one to do so, and enters the Great Palace.\nAfter venturing deep inside, Link must battle a flying creature known as Thunderbird, followed by a shadowy doppelg\u00e4nger of himself known as Dark Link.\nLink then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda.\nThe three
