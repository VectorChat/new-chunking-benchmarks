soon.\nAny delays to the F-35s will either raise costs again by forcing a major refurbishment of Canada\u2019s CF-18s, or leave Canada with serious gaps in its fighter fleet.", "Design Choices:

flounder on its CF-18 fighter replacement, it still continues to contribute to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\nSince the Liberal Party\u2019s campaign promise to ditch the F-35 and launch a new replacement competition, they continued paying $33 million into the program.\nMeanwhile, consultations have taken place with fighter manufacturers which some see as simply giving the Liberals political cover to buy a plane other than the F-35 without holding a competition.\nIf a fair and free competition were to include Lockheed Martin, a fair bet would be on the F-35 winning.\nJuly 12/16: A total of five defense manufacturers have expressed an interest in supplying the replacement to Canada\u2019s CF-18 fighters.\nLockheed Martin, Boeing, Eurofighter and Saab all took part in a conference call with Canadian officials last week, with Dassault planning to meet and discuss the matter at the Farnborough International Airshow this week.\nLockheed, whose F-35 was dropped by the Canadian government, welcomed the meetings as a first step towards a new competition.", "\u201cIn December 2011, the Defence Department\u2019s research arm, Defence Research and Development Canada, published a report in which it said \u201cthat the probability of having 63 or more (F-35s) remaining at this time (when the last one is delivered) is approximately 54 per cent.\u201d Canada plans to order 65 F-35As, for delivery from 2017-2022.\nTheir expectation is 7-11 destroyed aircraft over the fleet\u2019s expected 42-year lifespan, with losses fitting the standard fighter pattern and being heavier in the early years.\nSo they\u2019re claculating a 46% chance that 2 or more F-35As are crashed or lost in the first 6 years.\nNot unusual, or unreasonable.\nWhere the math becomes more questionable is the expectation that Canada can order 65 F-35As plus accompanying spares, training equipment, etc.\nwith its budgeted funds, while placing orders in the program\u2019s early production years from 2014-2020.", "July 16/10: Sole-source F-35, eh?\nCanada\u2019s Conservative Party government declares that it will buy the F-35A, without a competitive process.\nThe jets would begin to enter service around 2016, and the initial budget is C$ 9 billion for 65 F-35 aircraft and associated weapons, supporting infrastructure, initial spares, training simulators, contingency funds and project operating costs.\nThat budget has not been confirmed by an actual contract, however, something that reportedly led to unpleasant surprises when Canada bought C-130Js from Lockheed Martin.\nDND statements indicate that an F-35 contract would not be negotiated until about 2014-2015.\nThe government\u2019s defense of its decision revolves around economic and industrial benefits: \u201cTo date, Canada has invested approximately CAD$168 million in the JSF program.\nSince 2002, the Government\u2019s participation in the JSF program has led to more than CAD$350 million in contracts for more than 85 Canadian companies, research laboratories, and universities \u2013 meaning that Canada has already seen a two-to-one return on its investment.\nNow that Canada has committed to purchasing the F-35, Canadian industrial opportunities could exceed CAD$12 billion for the production of the aircraft.\nSustainment and follow-on opportunities for Canadian industry are emerging and will be available over the 40-year life of the program.\nFor instance, in accordance with the industrial participation agreements, all 19 Canadian companies manufacturing items for the F-35 will also repair and overhaul those components for the entire global fleet.\u201d The government", "The Americans had better hope that stealth continues to work in practice.\nThey\u2019ve placed their entire future fighter bet on stealth, and are paying the accompanying financial and operational costs.\nThe Europeans, in contrast, looked askance at the added construction and maintenance costs of stealth, and at the huge expense of aerodynamic changes once a stealth design is set.\nThey opted instead for radar cross-section reduction that stopped short of full stealth, plus high kinematic performance.\nAdvanced electronic warfare and defensive systems integrated into the planes, non-standard sensors like Infra-Red Search & Track, and long-reach weapons like the Meteor air-to-air missile and stealthy cruise missiles, would all improve protection in other ways.", "Right now, modern ground radars are lengthening the ranges at which stealth aircraft can be detected, and AESA fighter radars are getting better.\nThose trends will continue, but neither will invalidate stealth on its own.\nWith that said, there are at least 2 key technologies that could significantly change stealth design\u2019s cost:benefit ratio.\nInfrared Search & Track (IRST) systems on planes like the Eurofighter and Rafale, on the F-35 itself, and on most Russian-designed fighters, already offers a potential alternative to radar in aerial engagements.\nThe B-2 picture above was taken by a Eurofighter\u2019s PIRATE IRST system, and used in a presentation to the Norwegian government.\nThe mechanics of fuel circulation in the F-35 are intended to make heat-based lock-ons harder to achieve, and there are pilot-activated additives that can even frustrate locks from tailpipe exhaust, but processors will continue to improve, and so will infrared detection arrays.\nIRST will remain a potent and improving solution for detection and location, and the mere friction of an airplane cutting through the atmosphere at high speed is very hard to hide completely.\nThe greatest long-term threat to stealth is probably a combination of \u201cpassive\u201d radars that collect input from wider slices of the spectrum.\nThey\u2019d need to be paired with ever-expanding processing power that can separate anomalies from the clutter by collating multiple input types, and with networked analysis that collates multiple sensor systems.\nEarly research and tests have begun in this area, courtesy of firms like Saab and EADS.", "There are reports that Saab pulled out of the competition in June 2013.\nSaab\u2019s issue, if it gets an opening, is how to compete with a Super Hornet option whose production volume gives it a similar price, plus twin engines, long-term modernization assurance, local allied and expeditionary commonality, and lobbying from Canada\u2019s biggest aerospace firm?", "The answer to this question is very consequential to Canada, but it\u2019s hard to say at this point, because the respective approaches haven\u2019t been fully tested against top-end enemy systems.\nAmerican stealth worked very well against Iraq, twice.\nModern European fighters were more than sufficient over Libya in 2011, however; and the stealthless Israelis sliced through dense Syrian air defenses in 2007, using planning, jammming, and well-chosen weapons to destroy a nuclear reactor.\nIf stealth remains fully or mostly relevant, even as a matter of faith rather than proof, Europe\u2019s high-end jets will be unable to compete with American stealth fighters.\nWorse, the F-35\u2019s full-rate production costs beyond 2020 would make it lethal in export competitions.\nOn the other hand, if jamming keeps pace, or if stealth\u2019s advantages can be beaten or watered down, the European approach can create cheaper planes with better aerodynamic performance.", "One is the structure of the Canadian Parliamentary system, in which a majority government has no meaningful checks and balances.\nIf the current majority Conservative Party government wants a plane, it can force the sale through, easily.\nThe Conservatives in particular will bear little political cost for doing so, because they have become the only party in the country with serious security credentials.\nThe national security constituency largely lives within that party, and will be happy that something is being done after decades of neglect.\nThe rest of the population isn\u2019t overly interested.\nThe Liberal Party found this out to their sorrow when they tried to make the F-35 an election issue in 2011, and watched the attempt fizzle.\nThey had a solid case, but the messenger had no credibility with people who were interested in the issue.\nAnother point in the F-35\u2019s favor is its industrial program.\nIt\u2019s working as intended, by creating industrial constituencies with a strong interest in keeping the purchase.\nThe power of that constituency is partly offset by the fact that Boeing, Canada\u2019s largest aerospace player, is on the other side of the dispute.\nBut only partly.\nOrganizations billing actual dollars will always fight harder that those who might benefit at some future date.\nWhich is why the F-35\u2019s industrial benefits are the current focus of the government\u2019s F-35 defense."]
