["Under the Fourth Amendment search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it\nFourth Amendment case law deals with three central questions : what government activities constitute \" search \" and \" seizure \" ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed\nEarly court decisions limited the amendment 's scope to a law enforcement officer 's physical intrusion onto private property but with Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) the Supreme Court held that its protections such as the warrant requirement extend to the privacy of individuals as well as physical locations\nLaw enforcement officers need a warrant for most search and seizure activities but the Court has defined a series of exceptions for consent searches motor vehicle searches evidence in plain view exigent circumstances border searches and other situations\nThe exclusionary rule is one way the amendment is enforced\nEstablished in Weeks v. United States ( 1914 ) this rule holds that evidence obtained through a Fourth Amendment violation is generally inadmissible at criminal trials\nEvidence discovered as a later result of an illegal search may also be inadmissible as \" fruit of the poisonous tree \" unless it inevitably would have been discovered by legal means", "The Bill of Rights originally only restricted the federal government and went through a long initial phase of \" judicial dormancy \" ; in the words of historian Gordon S. Wood \" After ratification most Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the Constitution \"\nFederal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was narrow until the late 19th century when the Interstate Commerce Act and Sherman Antitrust Act were passed\nAs federal criminal jurisdiction expanded to include other areas such as narcotics more questions about the Fourth Amendment came to the Supreme Court\nThe U.S. Supreme Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose of the amendment as guaranteeing \" the privacy dignity and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function \"\nIn Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nFourth Amendment case law deals with three central issues : what government activities constitute \" search \" and \" seizure \" ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed", "One threshold question in the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether a \" search \" has occurred\nInitial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on a citizen 's property rights \u2014 that is when the government physically intrudes on \" persons houses papers or effects \" for the purpose of obtaining information a \" search \" within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment has occurred\nEarly 20th @-@ century Court decisions such as Olmstead v. United States ( 1928 ) held that Fourth Amendment rights applied in cases of physical intrusion but not to other forms of police surveillance ( e.g.\n, wiretaps )\nIn Silverman v. United States ( 1961 ) the Court stated of the amendment that \" at the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion \"", "When police conduct a search the amendment requires that the warrant establish probable cause to believe that the search will uncover criminal activity or contraband\nThey must have legally sufficient reasons to believe a search is necessary\nIn Carroll v. United States ( 1925 ) the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible common @-@ sense standard\nTo that end the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States ( 1925 ) that the term probable cause means \" less than evidence that would justify condemnation \" reiterating Carroll 's assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would \" warrant a man of reasonable caution \" in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime\nIt does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false\nA \" practical non @-@ technical \" probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required\nIn Illinois v. Gates ( 1983 ) the Court ruled that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the \" totality of the circumstances \"", "The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion with a few exceptions\nIn Delaware v. Prouse ( 1979 ) the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver 's license and the registration of the automobile unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law\nWhere society 's need is great no other effective means of meeting the need is available and intrusion on people 's privacy is minimal certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists\nIn United States v. Martinez @-@ Fuerte ( 1976 ) the Supreme Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints\nIn Michigan Dept.\nof State Police v. Sitz ( 1990 ) the Supreme Court allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints\nIn Illinois v. Lidster ( 2004 ) the Supreme Court allowed focused informational checkpoints\nHowever in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond ( 2000 ) the Supreme Court ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general crime @-@ fighting checkpoints are not allowed", "The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized", "The Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to information that is voluntarily given to third parties\nIn Smith the Court held individuals have no \" legitimate expectation of privacy \" regarding the telephone numbers they dial because they knowingly give that information to telephone companies when they dial a number\nFollowing Katz the vast majority of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy but in United States v. Jones ( 2012 ) the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law but rather has supplemented it\nIn Jones law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car 's exterior without Jones ' knowledge or consent\nThe Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to the car and so had a property interest in the car\nTherefore since the intrusion on the vehicle \u2014 a common law trespass \u2014 was for the purpose of obtaining information the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment\nThe Court used similar \" trespass \" reasoning in Florida v. Jardines ( 2013 ) to rule that bringing a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search", "In United States v. Mendenhall ( 1980 ) the Court held that a person is seized only when by means of physical force or show of authority his freedom of movement is restrained and in the circumstances surrounding the incident a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave\nIn Florida v. Bostick ( 1991 ) the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required the police contact is a \" citizen encounter \" that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment\nIf a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person 's privacy under the Fourth Amendment", "In certain situations law enforcement may perform a search when they have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest\nUnder Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances\nIn Terry the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses \" unusual conduct \" that leads that officer to reasonably believe \" that criminal activity may be afoot \" that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others the officer may conduct a \" pat @-@ down search \" ( or \" frisk \" ) to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon\nThis detention and search is known as a Terry stop\nTo conduct a frisk officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably warrant their actions\nAs established in Florida v. Royer ( 1983 ) such a search must be temporary and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop ( e.g.\n, officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car cannot after confirming that it is not stolen compel the person to answer questions about anything else such as the possession of contraband )", "= = = Probable cause = = = The standards of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search\nThe government has a probable cause to make an arrest when \" the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information \" would lead a prudent person to believe that the arrested person had committed or was committing a crime\nProbable cause to arrest must exist before the arrest is made\nEvidence obtained after the arrest may not apply retroactively to justify the arrest", "According to the plain view doctrine as defined in Coolidge v. New Hampshire ( 1971 ) if an officer is lawfully present he may seize objects that are in \" plain view \"\nHowever the officer must have had probable cause to believe that the objects are contraband\nSimilarly \" open fields \" such as pastures open water and woods may be searched without a warrant on the ground that conduct occurring therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy\nThe doctrine was first articulated by the Court in Hester v. United States ( 1924 ) which stated that \" the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their ' persons houses papers and effects ' is not extended to the open fields \"", "In Oliver v. United States ( 1984 ) the police ignored a \" no trespassing \" sign and a fence trespassed onto the suspect 's land without a warrant followed a path for hundreds of feet and discovered a field of marijuana\nThe Supreme Court ruled that no search had taken place because there was no privacy expectation regarding an open field :", "The Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that a search or an arrest generally requires a judicially sanctioned warrant because the basic rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and \" searches conducted outside the judicial process without prior approval by judge or magistrate are per se unreasonable \"\nIn order for such a warrant to be considered reasonable it must be supported by probable cause and be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a person ( usually a law enforcement officer ) who has sworn by it and is therefore accountable to the issuing court\nThe Supreme Court further held in Chandler v. Miller ( 1997 ) : \" To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment a search ordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing\nBut particularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes warranted based on ' special needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement '\n...\nWhen such ' special needs ' are alleged courts must undertake a context @-@ specific inquiry examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties \"\nThe amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures but not those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on behalf of a government\nIn Ontario v. Quon ( 2010 ) the Court held the amendment to also apply to the government when acting as an employer ruling that a government could search a police officer 's text messages that were sent over that government 's pager", "= Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution = The Fourth Amendment ( Amendment IV ) to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and requires any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause\nIt is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance a type of general search warrant issued by the British government and a major source of tension in pre @-@ Revolutionary America\nThe Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights in response to Anti @-@ Federalist objections to the new Constitution\nCongress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28 1789\nBy December 15 1791 the necessary three @-@ quarters of the states had ratified it\nOn March 1 1792 Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment\nBecause the Bill of Rights did not initially apply to the states and federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century of the nation 's history there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century\nThe amendment was held to apply to the states in Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 )", "Fourth Amendment protections expanded significantly with Katz v. United States ( 1967 )\nIn Katz the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual 's right to privacy and ruled that a search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached to the outside of the glass\nWhile there was no physical intrusion into the booth the Court reasoned that : 1 ) Katz by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him had exhibited his expectation that \" the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world \" ; and 2 ) society believes that his expectation was reasonable\nJustice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that \" the Fourth Amendment protects people not places \"\nA \" search \" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person 's \" reasonable expectation of privacy \"\nKatz 's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government 's intrusion though electronic rather than physical was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment and thus necessitated a warrant\nThe Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed\nThis decision in Katz was later developed into the now commonly used two @-@ prong test adopted in Smith v. Maryland ( 1979 ) for determining whether the Fourth Amendment is applicable in a given circumstance :", "Seeing the danger general warrants presented the Virginia Declaration of Rights ( 1776 ) explicitly forbade the use of general warrants\nThis prohibition became a precedent for the Fourth Amendment : That general warrants whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed or to seize any person or persons not named or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted", "When a person is arrested and taken into police custody he has been seized ( i.e.\n, a reasonable person who is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car would not think they were free to leave )\nA person subjected to a routine traffic stop on the other hand has been seized but is not \" arrested \" because traffic stops are a relatively brief encounter and are more analogous to a Terry stop than to a formal arrest\nIf a person is not under suspicion of illegal behavior a law enforcement official is not allowed to place an individual under arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the case\nA search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment so long as the arresting officer has probable cause\nIn Maryland v. King ( 2013 ) the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for DNA upon arrests for serious crimes along the same reasoning that allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest and detain", "The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizure of any person person 's home ( including its curtilage ) or personal property without a warrant\nA seizure of property occurs when there is \" some meaningful interference with an individual 's possessory interests in that property \" such as when police officers take personal property away from an owner to use as evidence or when they participate in an eviction\nThe amendment also protects against unreasonable seizure of persons including a brief detention\nA seizure does not occur just because the government questions an individual in a public place\nThe exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution\nThe person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained\nThe government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable objective grounds with few exceptions\nHis refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds", "a person \" has exhibited an actual ( subjective ) expectation of privacy \" ; and society is prepared to recognize that this expectation is ( objectively ) reasonable", "Like many other areas of American law the Fourth Amendment finds its roots in English legal doctrine\nSir Edward Coke in Semayne 's case ( 1604 ) famously stated : \" The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose \"\nSemayne 's Case acknowledged that the King did not have unbridled authority to intrude on his subjects ' dwellings but recognized that government agents were permitted to conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained", "open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance\nThere is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities such as the cultivation of crops that occur in open fields\nWhile open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment the curtilage or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home is protected\nCourts have treated this area as an extension of the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person 's home ( unlike a person 's open fields ) under the Fourth Amendment\nThe curtilag", "If a party gives consent to a search a warrant is not required\nThere are exceptions and complications to the rule including the scope of the consent given whether the consent is voluntarily given and whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another 's property\nIn Schneckloth v.
