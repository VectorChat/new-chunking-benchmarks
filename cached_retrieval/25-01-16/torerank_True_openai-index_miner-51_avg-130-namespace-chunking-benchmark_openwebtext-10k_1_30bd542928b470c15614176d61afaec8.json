and AK): QQ and AK are barely above the threshold, while all weaker hands will be big underdogs.\nThus, Bob's pure value range is {QQ+, AK}, and he happily 3-bets these hands, and then 5-bets them all-in, purely for value.", "His value range also includes some 5-bet bluffs, and the next step is to find these.\nThen we pick a range of 3-bet bluffs that Bob plans to fold to a 4-bet.\nWe'll also

value range (including his 5-bet bluffs).\nHis total value range is {KK+, A5s, A4s} =20 combos, so Bob can pick 1.5 x 20 =30 3-bet bluff combos.\nAs mentioned previously, there are two techniques Bob can use: Pick 30 specific combos and always 3-bet them 3-bet all hands from the candidate list a certain percentage of the time I prefer the percentage method.", "But we will discuss the flatting range briefly, since it helps us understand the big picture.\nWhen Alice has raised, Bob can respond in 3-ways: He can 3-bet (for value or as a bluff), he can flat, or he can fold.\nDifferent hands have different jobs to do within these ranges.\nAnd depending on Alice's opening range, hands can move between Bob's 3-betting/flatting/folding ranges.\nFor example, we'll see that AK isn't strong enough to be a value hand for Bob against Alice's EP range, so AK goes into the flatting range in this scenario.\nBut when Alice opens a much wider ~25% range in CO, AK is promoted to a value hand

3-bet bluff.He then needs to win more than 12/(5 + 12) =70% to have a profitable bluff.\nSo if Alice folds more than 70%, Bob will have an automatic profit by 3-bet bluffing any two.", "When Alice

5-betting: Bob starts by finding which hands he can 3-bet for value, planning to 5-bet all-in against Alice's 4-bet value range.", "Keep in mind that Alice knows Bob's strategy, since this follows from her own strategy, which follows from her opening range, which both players know.\nSo she knows Bob only 3-bets/5-bets {KK+} for pure value, and if Bob's doesn't 5-bet bluff a bit, Alice can improve her 5-bet-calling strategy by folding the big underdog's QQ/AK from her value range {QQ+, AK}.\nAnd when one of the players can improve his/her EV by a strategy change, the original strategy pair can't be optimal (per definition).", "Bob first 3-bet to 12, so the 5-bet is 88bb more.\nOn average, Bob gets 0.30 x 201.5 =60bb back from the pot, so his net loss after 5-betting and getting called is 88 60 =28bb.The pot size before Bob's 5-bet is 40.5bb (1.5 from the blinds, + 27 from Alice's 4-bet + 12 from Bob's 3-bet).\nSo Bob is effectively risking 28bb to win 40.5bb when he is 5-bet bluffing.\nThe effective pot odds are 40.5 : 28, and Bob needs to win at least 28/(28 + 40.5) =40% to profit from 5-bet bluffing any two (or more precisely, any Axs hand, since we base our calculations on having ~30% equity when called).For Alice, this means she has to call a 5-bet 60% of the time to prevent Bob from making a profit by 5-betting any two.", "1.3 Background material for

61) =25% of our 3-bets are for value, and 75% are bluffs.\nOur first adjustment to exploit this particular opponent is therefore to lower the optimal value/bluff ratio from the optimal 40/ to the more exploitative 25/75.\nThen we can also drop 5-bet-bluffing against this tight player, as discussed previously.\nThe simplest adjustment is to keep 3-betting our 5-bet bluffing hands A5s/A4s, but we move them from the value range down to the 3-bet bluff range, and fold them to a 4-bet.\nThe only hands we 5-bet against this player and his {QQ+, AK} 4-bet range is {KK+}, purely for value.", "We add 5-bet bluffs to Bob's value range We now want to add enough Axs hands so that Alice weakest value hands (JJ and AQ) are break even when they call our 5-bet range (and the threshold is 36% equity, as shown previously).\nWe start with A5s/A4s and see what we get: Alice's weakest value hand is AQ, and it's a small loser with 34% equity against Bob's total value range {QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s}.\nClose enough for us, so the 5-bet bluffs in this case are the same as we used against Alice's EP range.\nHowever, if we want it to be exact, we need to add a couple more bluffs (for example, Bob's 3-bet bluffing Bob's value range, including 5-bet bluffs, is {QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s} =42 combos.", "Obvious value hands like high pairs and AK have to be included, since these hands have a job to do in the ranges for 4-betting and calling 5-bets.\nBut the exact mixture of medium and weak hands in Alice's range is irrelevant.We give Alice the following range:22+ATs+ AJo+KTs+ KQoQTs+J9s+T9s98s87s76s186 combos14%We now place Bob somewhere with position on Alice.\nAlice open-raises and it's folded to Bob, who 3-bets.\nBoth players want to play perfectly against the other, and both assume the other is also trying to play perfectly.Alice starts by defining her value range.\nThis is per definition the hands she plans to 4-bet for value and then call a 5-bet with.", "Therefore we don't want to 3-bet them for value.\nKeep in mind that the process of getting all-in starts with a 3-bet, and we know the moment Alice open-raises with a ~15% EP range that her all-in range is a favorite over our QQ and AK hands.\nTherefore, since we know this before we have put our first chip into the pot, we don't want to choose a path with QQ/AK that is the first step towards getting all-in with them preflop.\nThis is also true for other hands that are good enough to play for value, but not strong enough to get all-in preflop against Alice's value range {QQ+, AK}.\nExamples of such hands are QQ-22, AK-AJ, KQ, QJs-T9s, etc.\n(and you can probably list some more if you think about it)."]
