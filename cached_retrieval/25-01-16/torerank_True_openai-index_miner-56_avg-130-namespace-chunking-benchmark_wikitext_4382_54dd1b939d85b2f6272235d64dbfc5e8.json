United States ( 1967 ) the Supreme Court held that its protections such as the warrant requirement extend to the privacy of individuals as well as physical locations", "In Ontario v.

Ohio ( 1961 )\nUnder the Fourth Amendment search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it", "In Katz the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual 's right to privacy and ruled that a search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached to the outside of the glass\nWhile there was no physical intrusion into the booth the Court reasoned that : 1 ) Katz by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him had exhibited his expectation that \" the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world \" ; and 2 ) society believes that his expectation was reasonable\nJustice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that \" the Fourth Amendment protects people not places \"", "In Smith the Court held individuals have no \" legitimate expectation of privacy \" regarding the telephone numbers they dial because they knowingly give that information to telephone companies when they dial a number\nFollowing Katz the vast majority of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy but in United States v. Jones ( 2012 ) the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law but rather has supplemented it\nIn Jones law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car 's exterior without Jones ' knowledge or consent", "Law enforcement officers need a warrant for most search and seizure activities but the Court has defined a series of exceptions for consent searches motor vehicle searches evidence in plain view exigent circumstances border searches and other situations\nThe exclusionary rule is one way the amendment is enforced\nEstablished in Weeks v.

United States ( 1984 ) the police ignored a \" no trespassing \" sign and a fence trespassed onto the suspect 's land without a warrant followed a path for hundreds of feet and discovered a field of marijuana\nThe Supreme Court ruled that no search had taken place because there was no privacy expectation regarding an open field : open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance\nThere is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities such as the cultivation of crops that occur in open fields", "To conduct a frisk officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably warrant their actions\nAs established in Florida v. Royer ( 1983 ) such a search must be temporary and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop ( e.g.\n, officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car cannot after confirming that it is not stolen compel the person to answer questions about anything else such as the possession of contraband )", "In United States v. Mendenhall ( 1980 ) the Court held that a person is seized only when by means of physical force or show of authority his freedom of movement is restrained and in the circumstances surrounding the incident a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave\nIn Florida v. Bostick ( 1991 ) the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required the police contact is a \" citizen encounter \" that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment", "The Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that a search or an arrest generally requires a judicially sanctioned warrant because the basic rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and \" searches conducted outside the judicial process without prior approval by judge or magistrate are per se unreasonable \"\nIn order for such a warrant to be considered reasonable it must be supported by probable cause and be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a person ( usually a law enforcement officer ) who has sworn by it and is therefore accountable to the issuing court", "In Carroll v. United States ( 1925 ) the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible common @-@ sense standard\nTo that end the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States ( 1925 ) that the term probable cause means \" less than evidence that would justify condemnation \" reiterating Carroll 's assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would \" warrant a man of reasonable caution \" in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime\nIt does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false", "All warrants therefore are contrary to this right if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation ; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer to make search in suspected places or to arrest one or more suspected persons or to seize their property be not accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search arrest or seizure : and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases and with the formalities prescribed by the laws", "= = = = Exceptions = = = = The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion with a few exceptions\nIn Delaware v.

King ( 2013 ) the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for DNA upon arrests for serious crimes along the same reasoning that allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest and detain", "The U.S. Supreme Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose of the amendment as guaranteeing \" the privacy dignity and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function \"\nIn Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment", "Seeing the danger general warrants presented the Virginia Declaration of Rights ( 1776 ) explicitly forbade the use of general warrants\nThis prohibition became a precedent for the Fourth Amendment : That general warrants whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed or to seize any person or persons not named or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted", "A \" search \" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person 's \" reasonable expectation of privacy \"\nKatz 's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government 's intrusion though electronic rather than physical was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment and thus necessitated a warrant\nThe Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed", "= = = Seizure = = = The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizure of any person person 's home ( including its curtilage ) or personal property without a warrant\nA seizure of property occurs when there is \" some meaningful interference with an individual 's possessory interests in that property \" such as when police officers take personal property away from an owner to use as evidence or when they participate in an eviction", "However the officer must have had probable cause to believe that the objects are contraband\nSimilarly \" open fields \" such as pastures open water and woods may be searched without a warrant on the ground that conduct occurring therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy\nThe doctrine was first articulated by the Court in Hester v.

Bustamonte ( 1973 ) the Court ruled that a consent search is still valid even if the police do not inform a suspect of his right to refuse the search\nThis contrasts with Fifth Amendment rights which cannot be relinquished without an explicit Miranda warning from police", "The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to the car and so had a property interest in the car\nTherefore since the intrusion on the vehicle \u2014 a common law trespass \u2014 was for the purpose of obtaining information the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment\nThe Court used similar \" trespass \" reasoning in Florida v. Jardines ( 2013 ) to rule that bringing a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search\nIn certain situations law enforcement may perform a search when they have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest", "Under Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances\nIn Terry the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses \" unusual conduct \" that leads that officer to reasonably believe \" that criminal activity may be afoot \" that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others the officer may conduct a \" pat @-@ down search \" ( or \" frisk \" ) to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon\nThis detention and search is known as a Terry stop", "The Supreme Court further held in Chandler v. Miller ( 1997 ) : \" To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment a search ordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing\nBut particularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes warranted based on ' special needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement '\n...\nWhen such ' special needs ' are alleged courts must undertake a context @-@ specific inquiry examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties \"\nThe amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures but not those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on behalf of a government", "The 1760s saw a growth in the intensity of litigation against state officers who using general warrants conducted raids in search of materials relating to John Wilkes 's publications attacking both government policies and the King himself", "If a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person 's privacy under the Fourth Amendment\nWhen a person is arrested and taken into police custody he has been seized ( i.e.\n, a reasonable person who is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car would not think they were free to leave )\nA person subjected to a routine traffic stop on the other hand has been seized but is not \" arrested \" because traffic stops are a relatively brief encounter and are more analogous to a Terry stop than to a formal arrest", "Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification ( including Virginia Massachusetts and New York ) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights\nFour state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches\nIn the 1st United States Congress following the state legislatures ' request James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689 including an amendment requiring probable cause for government searches", "A \" practical non @-@ technical \" probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required\nIn Illinois v.
