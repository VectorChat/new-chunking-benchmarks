Alice 4-bets to 27bb, she is risking 23.5bb (27bb minus he 3.5bb raise) more to win a 17bb pot (1.5bb from the blinds + Alice's 3.5bb raise + Bob's 12bb 3-bet).", "She also knows how often she should

continues to produce game theory related videos.\nHis old videos from Stoxpoker might get moved over to Cardrunners, and if that happens, I recommend you check them out.\nWithout further ado, let's get started:", "Let's compute the number to use against Alice's EP range: To effectively have 30 bluff combos from the candidate list in our 3-betting range, we need to use each of them 30/152 =20% of the time.\nNote that this percentage isn't universal, like Alice's fixed 4-bet bluff percentage (15%) is for all her opening ranges.\nTo see this, note that Bob's value range varies with Alice's opening range, but the candidate list of 3-bet bluff hands is static (we have simply chosen some hands to use).\nSo Bob will have to calculate a new bluff% to use for his candidate list against each of Alice's opening ranges.\nHowever, this isn't a big job, we simply do the math once and for all against each of Alice's ranges and memorize the numbers we need (and we'll look at Alice's CO range in a minute).\nSo, finally: Bob's optimal 3-bet strategy against Alice's optimal raising strategy in EP {Bob's total 3-bet range} ={value hands and 5-bet-bluff hands} + {3-bet bluff hands} ={KK+, A5s, A4s} + 20% x {A9s-A6s,ATo-A8o,K9s-K6s,KJo-K9o,Q9s-Q6s,QJo-Q9o} Bob always 3-bets {KK+, A5s, A4s} and 5-bets all-in after a 4-bet.\nIf he has one of the 152 combos from his candidate list for 3-bet bluffing, he uses a randomizer and 3-bet bluffs 20% of the time, and he folds to a 4-bet.\nWe had to do a bit of work to construct all these ranges, but it was worth it, and we have learned a lot in the process.\nLet's see what Bob's optimal total 3-bet% is in this case: Value part: 20 combos (1.5% of all hands) Bluff part: Effectively 20% of 152 =30 combos (2.3% of all hands) This results in a total 3-bet% of 1.5 + 2.3 =3.8% against Alice's ~15% EP raises.\nHis value/bluff ratio is the desired optimal 20/30 =40/60.\nLater, when we construct an optimal strategy against Alice's 25% CO range, we'll see that Bob's 3-bet% skyrockets as a consequence of Alice raising a much wider opening range.\nNote that the combination of a candidate list of 3-bet bluff hands and a fixed (but adjustable) bluff% to use with these hands, gives us a lot of flexibility to adjust our 3-bet bluffing as we please.\nAgainst an unknown opponent, we can start with the optimal 20% frequency, and 3-bet {KK+, A5s, A4s} always, and the candidate list 20% of the time.\nBut if we note that the raiser doesn't defend optimally, we might want to adjust this bluff percentage.\nFor example, of the raiser never 4-bet bluffs and only 4-bets a tight value range like {QQ+, AK}, we can go bananas with our 3-bet bluffs.\nWe might decide to double the bluff frequency from 20% to 40% for our list of 152 bluff candidate combos.\nNow we have 20 value combos, and effectively 0.40 x 152 =61 bluff combos.\nThis means 20/(20 + 61) =25% of our 3-bets are for value, and 75% are bluffs.\nOur first adjustment to exploit this particular opponent is therefore to lower the optimal value/bluff ratio from the optimal 40/ to the more exploitative 25/75.\nThen we can also drop 5-bet-bluffing against this tight player, as discussed previously.\nThe simplest adjustment is to keep 3-betting our 5-bet bluffing hands A5s/A4s, but we move them from the value range down to the 3-bet bluff range, and fold them to a 4-bet.\nThe only hands we 5-bet against this player and his {QQ+, AK} 4-bet range is {KK+}, purely for value.", "Therefore we don't want to 3-bet them for value.\nKeep in mind that the process of getting all-in starts with a 3-bet, and we know the moment Alice open-raises with a ~15% EP range that her all-in range is a favorite over our QQ and AK hands.\nTherefore, since we know this before we have put our first chip into the pot, we don't want to choose a path with QQ/AK that is the first step towards getting all-in with them preflop.\nThis is also true for other hands that are good enough to play for value, but not strong enough to get all-in preflop against Alice's value range {QQ+, AK}.", "On average, Bob gets 0.30 x 201.5 =60bb back from the pot, so his net loss after 5-betting and getting called is 88 60 =28bb.\nThe pot size before Bob's 5-bet is 40.5bb (1.5 from the blinds, + 27 from Alice's 4-bet + 12 from Bob's 3-bet).\nSo Bob is effectively risking 28bb to win 40.5bb when he is 5-bet bluffing.", "The effective pot odds for Alice's 4-bet bluffs are 17 : 23.5, and she can make a profit by 4-bet bluffing any two (of the hands she open-raised) if Bob folds his 3-betting hands more than 23.5/(23.5 + 17) =58%.\nBob can't allow Alice to 4-bet bluff any two cards profitably, so he defends optimally by folding exactly 58% of the time, and 5-betting all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs as we shall soon see) 42% of the time.\nTherefore, 42% of Bob's 3-bets need to be value hands that he plans to 5-bet all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs).", "For example, if she opens 15% from UTG, this corresponds to a value range of 0.18 x 0.15 =2.7% of all hands.\nThis makes up 0.027 x 1326 =36 combos, e.g approximately the range {QQ+, AK} =34 combos.\nWe'll use this value range example when we summarize Bob's optimal strategy below.", "So Alice's 4-betting range has to contain 60% value hands and 40% bluff hands.\nNow we know everything we need to know about Alice's

time, and she does it by 4-betting 18% of her opening range for value and 12% as a bluff.\nSo she needs 0.18 x 326 =59 value combos that she can 4-bet and call a 5-bet with.\nIn EP she used [QQ+, AK}

{JJ+, AQ+} for value, planning to call a 5-bet.\nThose times she doesn't have a value hand (e.g.\n88, A9o, T9s, etc.\n), she 4-bets 15% of the time, and the rest of the time she folds.\nUsing a random number generator from That's it for Alice's CO strategy.\nOver to Bob: 4.2 Bob's optimal 3-bet-strategy against Alice's optimal raising strategy in CO Bob needs a value range, including an optimal number of 5-bet bluffs, and he needs a range of hands to 3-bet bluff.\nBob's pure value range Bob knows that Alice now uses {JJ+, AQ+} as her value range, so he builds a range of pure value hands that have at least 50% equity against {JJ+, AQ+}.\nAA and KK obviously belong in this range.\nTo see what else is included, we run equity calculations for the next tier of hands (QQ and AK): QQ and AK are barely above the threshold, while all weaker hands will be big underdogs.\nThus, Bob's pure value range is {QQ+, AK}, and he happily 3-bets these hands, and then 5-bets them all-in, purely for value.\nWe add 5-bet bluffs to Bob's value range We now want to add enough Axs hands so that Alice weakest value hands (JJ and AQ) are break even when they call our 5-bet range (and the threshold is 36% equity, as shown previously).\nWe start with A5s/A4s and see what we get: Alice's weakest value hand is AQ, and it's a small loser with 34% equity against Bob's total value range {QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s}.\nClose enough for us, so the 5-bet bluffs in this case are the same as we used against Alice's EP range.\nHowever, if we want it to be exact, we need to add a couple more bluffs (for example, Bob's 3-bet bluffing Bob's value range, including 5-bet bluffs, is {QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s} =42 combos.\nHe wants an optimal 40/60 value/bluff-ratio, so he needs 60/40 =1.5 times as many bluff combos.\nThis amounts to 1.5 x 42 =63 bluff combos.\nWe use the previously defined candidate list for 3-bet bluff hands: Candidate list for 3-bet bluffing: Ace high: A9s-A6s ATo-A8o (52 combos) King high: K9s-K6s, KJo-K9o (52 combos) Queen high: Q9s-Q6s, QJo-Q9o (52 combos) We bluff these hands some fixed percentage x, and for this to effectively correspond to 63 bluff combos, we need x =63/152 =41%.\nWe can round this to x =40% to make it easy to remember.\nWe remember that we used a 20% bluff candidate frequency against Alice's ~15% EP range.\nSo when Alice moves from a ~15% EP range to a ~25% CO range, our 3-bet bluff candidate frequency doubles.\nWe only need to memorize the candidate list, and these two numbers (20% vs EP and 40% vs CO), and then we know all we need to know about 3-bet bluffing optimally against Alice's EP/CO ranges.\nAt any rate, against Alice's optimal CO raising strategy, Bob gets: Bob's optimal 3-bet strategy against Alice's optimal raising strategy in CO {Bob's total 3-bet range} ={value hands and 5-bet bluff hands} + {3-bet bluff hands} ={QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s} + 40% x {A9s-A6s,ATo-A8o,K9s-K6s,KJo-K9o,Q9s-Q6s,QJo-Q9o} Using a randomizer from Bob's total 3-bet% for this scenario is: Value part: 42 combos (3.2% of all hands) Bluff part: Effectively 40% of 152 =61 combos (4.6% of all hands) This results in a total 3-bet range of 3.2 + 4.6 =7.8% against Alice's ~25% CO range.\nThe value/bluff ratio, using our numerical rounding, is 42/61, which is very close to the optimal 40/60.\nWhen Alice moves from EP to CO and her opening range changes from ~15% to ~25%, Bob responds by loosening up his 3-betting range dramatically.\nThis is an interesting observation.\nThose of you who use a more or less static 3-betting range (for example, the generic {JJ+, AQ} without any 3-bet bluffing that is recommended on many low limit forums) now have game theoretical \"proof\" that we can get away with a lot of 3-bet bluffing on the button against a CO raiser.\nEven against a TAG CO raiser with a solid ~25% opening range, you can 3-bet almost 8% on the button and there isn't anything he can do to exploit your loose 3-bets.", "It's of course possible to vary EP opening ranges a lot, according to opponent tendencies and general game conditions.\nBut the core strategy for a typical TAG is to open somewhere around 15% of his hands (plus/minus a couple of percentage points in both directions) from both EP positions, and slightly tighter from UTG than from MP.", "This will give Alice (and the blinds, should they get involved) opportunities to make postflop mistakes that we can exploit.\nBut later in the article we'll let Alice open with a ~25% range from CO, and we'll see that QQ/AK now moves up to Bob's value range.\nAlice's value range is wider and weaker with a 25% opening range, and Bob's optimal 3-bet strategy changes accordingly.\nOK, enough about flatting.\nLet's move on and find Bob's 5-bet bluffs, and then his 3-bet bluffing range:", "And the result is a pair of strategies that are perfect against each other, and we have our optimal strategy pair.\nWhen we have learned these strategies, we have defensive (e.g.\nunexploitable) strategies we can use both as the raiser out of position, and as the 3-bettor in position.\nUsing these optimal strategies guarantees that better players can't exploit us.\nThey will also win against players who play poorly, although they will not win the maximum (if we want to exploit opponent leaks maximally, we have to deviate from optimal play ourselves, and use strategies that target specific leaks in our opponent's non-optimal strategies).", "The last piece of information we need is Bob's total 3-bet percentage in an optimal 3-betting strategy.\nWe find the answer by observing that Bob should 5-bet bluff enough to make Alice's weakest value hands break even.\nHe he bluffs more, Alice can gain by calling with more hands, and then Bob's strategy can't be optimal.", "When two good and aggressive NLHE-players engage in 3-bet/4-bet/5-bet warfare preflop, this is what usually happens: Both players operate with wide ranges, and all ranges have a significant percentage of bluffs in them, especially at the early stage (raising and 3-betting) Both players are willing to fold most of their bluffs (but not all of them), when their opponent reraises them back This results in ranges that start loose, but get more and more (but never completely) weighted towards value.", "Obvious value hands like high pairs and AK have to be included, since these hands have a job to do in the ranges for 4-betting and calling 5-bets.\nBut the exact mixture of medium and weak hands in Alice's range is irrelevant.\nWe give Alice the following range:", "This makes up 0.027 x 1326 =36 combos, e.g approximately the range {QQ+, AK} =34 combos.\nWe'll use this value range example when we summarize Bob's optimal strategy below.\nAnd then we'll illustrate each strategy step thoroughly when we apply the theory to Alice's EP and CO openraises.We summarize everything we have learned about Bob's optimal strategy for 3-betting and 5-betting:For example, if Alice raises 15% from the UTG, her optimal value range is {QQ+, AK} as shown previously.\nBob chooses value hands that are at least 50% against this range, and his pure value range becomes {KK+}."]
