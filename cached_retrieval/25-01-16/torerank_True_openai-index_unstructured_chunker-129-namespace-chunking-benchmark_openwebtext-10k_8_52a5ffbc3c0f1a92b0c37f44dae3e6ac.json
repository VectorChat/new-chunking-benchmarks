warns of the hard road ahead: The always fractured return to normal life is in fact the essence of a successful liberation.\nThings will not be made perfect.\nBut they will, or they can, be made better.\nThe problems facing Libya are difficult, but it also enjoys significant advantages.\nThe first problem, at least in terms of time, is unity.\nThe National Transitional Council, until now weighted toward easterners and Benghazi people, must swiftly bring in a balancing percentage of westerners and a significant representation of Berbers from the south.\nEqually, it must reach out to engage people from Muammar Gaddafi's core tribal constituencies.\nTribe matters much less in urbanised Libya than it used too but it is still important, and discrimination on tribal grounds would be foolish.\nThat would be playing Gaddafi's own divide-and-rule game after he is gone.\nA parallel process under which large parts of the police and the armed forces, apart from those with serious blood on their hands, will be retained is already envisaged in plans made by the NTC.\nThis avoids the error deemed so critical in Iraq, where disbanding the army left a security vacuum and fed an insurrection, but it will nevertheless not be easy.", "Chris Stephen writes from Misrata to say he can foresee the rebels falling out amongst themselves over whether to hand Muammar Gaddafi to the international criminal court, or give him an \"off with his head\" type of trial in Libya.\nChris says he feels the key to the rebels' rapid success over the last few days was Nato.\nGaddafi could not replace the kit being blown up every day by Nato raids, but instead of shortening his lines, he kept them in place.\nThe rebels played a subsidiary role, says Chris: their own poorly planned attacks helped with attrition and the other key role was that by forcing Gaddafi to defend the front lines they made Gaddafi concentrate his tanks and guns on the frontlines, giving Nato handy targets.\nChris says the rebel National Transitional Council has a problem with legitimacy.\nIt took power in a revolution, but if it does anything certain tribes or sections of the population do not like, the result will be protests claiming they are dictators.\nIt will be interesting, Chris says, to see in the coming weeks whether the NTC brings forces from outside Tripoli in to control the capital.\nChris also

perhaps the case can be made that no-fly zones have proven their effectiveness.\nNato went further than that, though, and that troubles me \u2014 because that's not what the citizens of Nato countries were told would happen, and it's not what the UN sanctioned.\nThe usual blowhard neocon commentators are now using this not only to defend the idea of humanitarian interventionism, but to bash [Barack] Obama for not committing greater resources (and presumably more aggressive tactics) to Nato because it might have ended the civil war more quickly.\nThat's impossible to know, though, and to
