["Psyche began to explain.\n\u2018You recall that plan of yours, by which you both persuaded me to take a two-edged razor and slay the beast who used to lie with me falsely claiming to be my husband, with the intention of later devouring my poor self with his greedy maw?\nI fell in with your proposal, but when the lamp which conspired with me allowed me to gaze on his face, the vision I beheld was astonishing and utterly divine; it was the son of the goddess Venus [Aphrodite], I mean Cupidos [Eros] himself, who lay peacefully sleeping there.\nI exulted at the sight of such beauty, and was confused by the sense of overwhelming delight, and as I experienced frustration at being unable to enjoy relations with him, the lamp by dreadful mischance shed a drop of burning oil on his shoulder.\nAt once the pain caused him to start from his sleep, and when he saw me wielding the steel and the flame, he said : \"This is a dreadful deed you have done.\nLeave my bed this instant, and take your goods and chattels with you.\nI shall now take your sister\"--at this point he cited your name specifically--\"in solemn marriage.\"\nAt once he then ordained Zephyrus to waft me outside the bounds of his estate.\u2019", "As Psyche trained her gaze insatiably and with no little curiosity on these her husband's weapons, in the course of handling and admiring them she drew out an arrow from the quiver, and tested its point on the tip of her thumb.\nBut because her arm was still trembling she pressed too hard, with the result that it pricked too deeply, and tiny drops of rose-red blood bedewed the surface of the skin.\nSo all unknowing and without prompting Psyche fell in love with Amor (Love) [Eros], being fired more and more with desire for the god of desire.\nShe gazed down on him in distraction, and as she passionately smothered him with wanton kisses from parted lips, she feared that he might stir in his sleep.\nBut while her wounded heart pounded on being roused by such striking beauty, the lamp disgorged a drop of burning oil from the tip of its flame upon the god's right shoulder; it could have been nefarious treachery, or malicious jealousy, or the desire, so to say, to touch and kiss that glorious body.\nO you rash, reckless lamp, Amor's (Love's) worthless servant, do you burn the very god who possesses all fire, though doubtless you were invented by some lover to ensure that he might possess for longer and even at night the object of his desire?\nThe god started up on being burnt; he saw that he was exposed, and that his trust was defiled.\nWithout a word he at once flew away from the kisses and embrace of his most unhappy wife.", "Then Psyche, though enfeebled in both body and mind, gained the strength lent her by fate's harsh decree.\nShe uncovered the lamp, seized the razor, and showed a boldness that belied her sex.\nBut as soon as the lamp was brought near, and the secrets of the couch were revealed, she beheld of all beasts the gentlest and sweetest, Cupidos [Eros] himself, a handsome god lying in a handsome posture.\nEven the lamplight was cheered and brightened on sighting him, and the razor felt suitable abashed at its sacrilegious sharpness.\nAs for Psyche, she was awe-struck at this wonderful vision, and she lost all her self-control.\nShe swooned and paled with enervation; her knees buckled, and she sought to hide the steel by plunging it into her own breast.\nIndeed, she would have perpetrated this, but the steel showed its fear of committing so serious a crime by plunging out of her rash grasp.\nBut as in her weariness and giddiness she gazed repeatedly on the beauty of that divine countenance, her mental balance was restored.\nShe beheld on his golden head his luxuriant hair steeped in ambrosia; his neatly pinned ringlets strayed over his milk-white neck and rosy cheeks, some dangling in front and some behind, and their surpassing sheen made even the lamplight flicker.\nOn the winged god's shoulders his dewy wings gleamed white with flashing brilliance; though they lay motionless, the soft and fragile feathers at their tips fluttered in quivering motion and sported restlessly.\nThe rest of his body, hairless and rosy, and was such that Venus [Aphrodite] would not have been ashamed to acknowledge", "PSYCHE (Psuch\u00ea), that is, \"breath\" or \"the soul,\" occurs in the later times of antiquity, as a personification of the human soul, and Apuleius (Met.\niv.\n28, &c.) relates about her the following beautiful allegoric story.\nPsyche was the youngest of the three daughters of some king, and excited by her beauty the jealousy and envy of Venus.\nIn order to avenge herself, the goddess ordered Amor to inspire Psyche with a love for the most contemptible of all men : but Amor was so stricken with her beauty that he himself fell in love with her.\nHe accordingly conveyed her to some charming place, where he, unseen and unknown, visited her every night, and left her as soon as the day began to dawn.\nPsyche might have continued to have enjoyed without interruption this state of happiness, if she had attended to the advice of her beloved, never to give way to her curiosity, or to inquire who he was.\nBut her jealous sisters made her believe that in the darkness of night she was embracing some hideous monster, and accordingly once, while Amor was asleep, she approached him with a lamp, and, to her amazement, she beheld the most handsome and lovely of the gods.\nIn her excitement of joy and fear, a drop of hot oil fell from her lamp upon his shoulder.\nThis awoke Amor, who censured her for her mistrust, and escaped.\nPsyche's peace was now gone all at once, and after having attempted in vain to throw herself into a river, she wandered about from temple to temple, inquiring after her beloved, and at length came to the palace of Venus.\nThere her real sufferings began, for Venus retained her,", "\"Meanwhile Psyche in her random wanderings was suffering torment, as she sought day and night to trace her husband.\nShe was restless in mind, but all the more eager, in spite of his anger, to soften him with a wife's endearments, or at any rate to appease him with a servant's entreaties.\nShe spied a temple perched on the peak of a high mountain, and she said : \u2018Perhaps this is where my lord dwells?She made her way quickly there, and though her feet were utterly weary from her unremitting labours, her hope and aspiration quickened them.\nShe mounted the higher ridges with stout heart, and drew close to the sacred shrine.\nThere she saw ears of wheat in a heap, and others woven into a garland, and ears of barley as well.\nThere were sickles lying there, and a whole array of harvesting implements, but they were in a jumbled and neglected heap, thrown carelessly by workmen's hands, as happens in summer-time.\nPsyche carefully sorted them out and ordered them in separate piles; no doubt she reflected that she should not neglect the shrines and rites of any deity, but rather implore the kindly spirit of each and all.\nKindly Ceres [Demeter] sighted her as she carefully and diligently ordered these offerings, and at once she cried out from afar : \u2018Why, you poor Psyche!\nVenus [Aphrodite] is in a rage, mounting a feverish search for your traces all over the globe.\nShe has marked you down for the sternest punishment, and is using all the resources of her divinity to demand vengeance.\nAnd here you are, looking to my interests, with your mind intent on anything but your own safety!\u2019", "That night Psyche's husband (he was invisible to her, but she could touch and hear him) said to her : \u2018Sweetest Psyche, fond wife that you are, Fortuna (Fortune) [Tykhe] grows more savage, and threatens you with mortal danger.\nI charge you: show greater circumspection.\nYour sisters are worried at the rumour that you are dead, and presently they will come to this rock to search for traces of you.\nShould you chance to hear their cries of grief, you are not to respond, or even to set eyes on them.\nOtherwise you will cause me the most painful affliction, and bring utter destruction on yourself.Psyche consented and promised to follow her husband's guidance.\nBut when he had vanished in company with the darkness, the poor girl spent the whole day crying and beating her breast.\nShe kept repeating that now all was up with her, for here she was confined and enclosed in that blessed prison, bereft of conversation with human beings for company, unable even to offer consoling relief to her sisters as they grieved for her, and not allowed even to catch a glimpse of them.\nNo ablutions, food, or other relaxation made her feel better, and she retired to sleep in floods of tears.", "While Psyche was at this time visiting one community after another in her concentrated search for Cupidos [Eros], he was lying groaning in his mother's chamber, racked by the pain of the wound from the lamp.\nBut then the tern, the white bird which wings her way over the sea-waves, plunged swiftly into the deep bosom of ocean.\nShe came upon Venus [Aphrodite] conveniently there as the goddess bathed and swam; she perched beside her, and told her that her son had suffered burning, and was lying in considerable pain from the wound, with his life in danger.\nAs a result the entire household of Venus was in bad odour, the object of gossip and rebuke on the lips of people everywhere.\nThey were claiming that Cupidos was relaxing with a leady of easy virtue in the mountains, and that Venus herself was idly swimming in the ocean, with the result that pleasure and favour and elegance had departed from the world; all was unkempt, rustic, uncouth.\nThere were no weddings, no camaraderie between friends, none of the love which children inspire; all was a scene of boundless squalor, of unsavoury tedium in sordid alliances.\nSuch was the gossip which that garrulous and prying bird whispered in Venus' ear, tearing her son's reputation to shreds.", "Then Psyche came to the full realization that this was the end of the road for her.\nAll pretence was at an end; she saw clearly that she was being driven to her immediate doom.\nIt could not be otherwise, for she was being forced to journey on foot of her own accord to Tartarus and the shades below.\nShe lingered no longer, but made for a very high tower, intending to throw herself headlong from it, for she thought that this was the direct and most glorious route down to the world below.\nBut the tower suddenly burst into speech, and said : \u2018Pour girl, why do you seek to put an end to yourself by throwing yourself down?\nWhat is the point of rash surrender before this, your final hazardous labour?\nOnce your spirit is sundered fro0m your body, you will certainly descent to the depths of Tartarus without the possibility of a return journey.", "At that moment her husband came to bed somewhat earlier than usual.\nShe was still weeping, and as he embraced her, he remonstrated with her : \u2018Is this how the promise you made me has turned out, Psyche, my dear?\nWhat is your husband to expect or to hope from you?\nYou never stop torturing your self night and day, even when we embrace each other as husband and wife.\nVery well, have it your own way, follow your own hell-bound inclination.\nBut when you begin to repent at leisure, remember the sober warning which I gave you.Then Psyche with prayers and threats of her impending death forced her husband to yield to her longing to see her sisters, to relieve their grief, and he also allowed her to present them with whatever pieces of gold or jewellery she chose.\nBut he kept deterring her with repeated warnings from being ever induced by the baleful prompting of her sisters to discover her husband's appearance.\nShe must not through sacrilegious curiosity tumble headlong from the lofty height of her happy fortune, and forfeit thereafter his embrace.\nShe thanked her husband, and with spirits soaring she said : \u2018But I would rather die a hundred times than forgo the supreme joy of my marriage with you.\nFor I love and cherish you passionately, whoever you are, as much as my own life, and I value you higher than Cupidos [Eros] himself.\nBut one further concession I beg for my prayers: bid your servant Zephyrus (the West Wind) spirit my sisters down to me, as he earlier wafted me down.\u2019", "Those female criminals had now made their way through the open gates, and had occupied the mind of their sister thus exposed.\nThey emerged from beneath the mantlet of their battering-ram, drew their swords, and advanced on the terrified thoughts of that simple girl.\nSo it was that one of them said to her : \u2018Our family ties compel us, in the interests of your safety, to disregard any danger whatsoever which lies before us, so we shall inform you of the one way by which you will attain the safety which has exercised us for so long.\nYou must whet a razor by running it over your softened palm, and when it is quite sharp hide it secretly by the bed where you usually lie.\nThen fill a well-trimmed lamp with oil, and when it is shining brightly, conceal it beneath the cover of an enclosing jar.\nOnce you have purposefully secreted this equipment, you must wait until your husband ploughs his furrow, and enters and climbs as usual into bed.\nThen, when he has stretched out and sleep has begun to oppress and enfold him, as soon as he starts the steady breathing which denotes deep sleep, you must slip off the couch.\nIn your bare feet and on tiptoe take mincing steps forward, and remove the lamp from its protective cover of darkness.\nThen take your cue from the lamp, and seize the moment to perform your own shining deed.\nGrasp the two-edged weapon boldly, first raise high your right hand, and then with all the force you can muster sever the knot which joins the neck and head of that venomous serpent.\nYou will not act without our help, for we shall be hovering anxiously in attendance, and", "As he finished speaking, he soared aloft on his wings.\nFrom her prostrate position on the ground Psyche watched her husband's flight as far as her eyes allowed, and she tortured her heart with the bitterest lamentations.\nBut once the sculling of his wings had removed him from her sight and he had disappeared into the distance, she hurled herself headlong down from the bank of a river close by.\nBut that kindly stream was doubtless keen to pay homage to the god who often scorches even the waters, and in fear for his person he at once cast her ashore on his current without injuring her, and set her on its grassy bank.\nThe rustic god Pan chanced to be sitting at that moment on the brow of the stream, holding the mountain deity Echo in his arms, and teaching her to repeat after him all kinds of songs.\nClose by the bank nanny-goats were sporting as they grazed and cropped the river-foliage here and there.\nThe goat-shaped god was well aware of the calamity that had befallen Psyche.\nHe called her gently to him, lovesick and weary as she was, and soothed her with these consoling words.\n\u2018You are an elegant girl, and I am a rustic herdsman, but my advanced years give me the benefit of considerable experience.\nIf my hazard is correct--sages actually call such guesswork divine insight--I infer from your stumbling and frequently wandering steps, from your excessively pale complexion and continual sighs, and not least from your mournful gaze, that you are suffering grievous love-pains.\nOn that account you must hearken to me: do not seek gain to destroy yourself by throwing yourself", "Poor Psyche, simple and innocent as she was, at once felt apprehension at these grim tidings.\nShe lost her head, and completely banished her recollection of all her husband's warnings and her own promises.\nShe launched herself into the abyss of disaster.\nTrembling and pale as the blood drained from her face, she barely opened her mouth as she gasped and stammered out this reply to them.\n\u2018Dearest sisters, you have acted rightly in continuing to observe your devoted duty, and as for those who make these assertions to you, I do not think that they are telling lies.\nIt is true that I have never seen my husband's face, and I have no knowledge whatsoever of where he hails form.\nI merely attend at night to the words of a husband to whom I submit with no knowledge of what he is like, for he certainly shuns the light of day.\nYour judgement is just that he is some beast, and I rightly agree with you.\nHe constantly and emphatically warns me against seeing what he looks like, and threatens me with great disaster if I show curiosity about his features.\nSo if at this moment you can offer saving help to your sister in her hour of danger, you must come to my rescue now.\nOtherwise your indifference to the future will tarnish the benefits of your previous concern.\u2019", "Their sister was already quite feverish with agitation, but these fiery words set her heart ablaze.\nAt once they left her, for their proximity to this most wicked crime made them fear greatly for themselves.\nSo the customary thrust of the winged Breeze bore them up to the rock, and they at once fled in precipitate haste.\nWithout delay they embarked on their ships and cast off.\nBut Psyche, now left alone, except that being harried by the hostile Furiae (Furies) [Erinyes] was no solitude, tossed in her grief like the waves of the sea.\nThough her plan was formed and her determination fixed, she still faltered in uncertainty of purpose as she set her hands to action, and was torn between the many impulses of her unhappy plight.\nShe made haste, she temperized; her daring turned more to fear, her diffidence to anger, and to cap everything she loathed the beast but loved the husband, though they were one and the same.\nBut now evening brought on darkness, so with headlong haste she prepared the instruments for the heinous crime.\nNight fell, and her husband arrived, and having first skirmished in the warfare of love, he fell in to a heavy sleep.", "Psyche's response was muffled with tearful sobs.\n\u2018Some time ago, I think, you had proof of my trustworthiness and discretion, and on this occasion too my resolution will likewise win your approval.\nOnly tell our Zephyrus to provide his services again, and allow me at least a glimpse of my sisters as consolation for your unwillingness to let me gaze on your sacred face.\nI beg you by these locks of yours which with their scent of cinnamon dangle all round your head, by your cheeks as soft and smooth as my own, by your breast which diffuses its hidden heat, as I hope to observe your features as reflected at least in this our tiny child: accede to the devoted prayers of this careworn suppliant, and grant me the blessing of my sisters' embraces.\nThen you will give fresh life and joy to your Psyche, your own devoted and dedicated dear one.\nI no longer seek to see your face; the very darkness of the night is not oppressive to me, for you are my light to which I cling.\u2019", "Psyche felt a blessed assurance being bestowed upon herby heaven's provision.\nShe heeded the suggestions of the disembodied voice, and after taking a nap and then a bath to dispel her fatigue, she at once noted a semicircular couch and table close at hand.\nThe dishes laid for dinner gave her to understand that all was set for her refreshment, so she gladly reclined there.\nImmediately wine was delicious as nectar and various plates of food were placed before her, brought not by human hands but unsupported on a gust of wind.\nShe could see no living soul, and merely heard words emerging from thin air: her serving-maids were merely voices.\nWhen she had enjoyed the rich feast, a singer entered and performed unseen, while another musician strummed a lyre which was likewise invisible.\nThen the harmonious voices of a tuneful choir struck her ears, so that it was clear that a choral group was in attendance, though no person could be seen.", "As she prayed like this, Juno [Hera] at once appeared before her in all the venerable majesty of her divinity.\nThere and then the goddess said : \u2018Believe me, I only wish that I could crown your prayers with my consent.\nBut shame prevents me from opposing the will of Venus [Aphrodite], my daughter-in-law whom I have always loved as my own daughter.\nThere is a second obstacle--the legislation which forbids sanctuary for runaway slaves belonging to others, if their owners forbid it.Psyche was aghast at this second shipwreck devised by Fortuna (Fortune).\nUnable to meet up with her elusive husband, she abandoned all hope of salvation, and had recourse to her own counsel.\n\u2018What other assistance can I seek or harness to meet my desperate plight?\nEven the goodwill of goddesses however well-disposed has been of no avail to me.\nNow that I am trapped in a noose as tight as this, where can I make for, under what roof or in what dark corner can I hide, to escape the unwinking eyes of mighty Venus?\nWhy don't you show a manly spirit, and the strength to renounce idle hope?\nWhy don't you surrender yourself voluntarily to your mistress, and soften her savage onslaught by showing a humble demeanour, however late in the day?\nYou never know, you may find the object of your long search in her house.This was how she steeled herself for the uncertain outcome of showing obedience or rather for her certain destruction, as she mentally rehearsed the opening lines of the plea she was to utter.", "But now those baneful, most abhorrent Furiae (Furies) [Erinyes] were hastening on their impious way aborad ship, exhaling their snakelike poison.\nIt was then that Psyche's husband on his brief visit again warned her : \u2018This is the day of crisis, the moment of worst hazard.\nThose troublesome members of your sex, those hostile blood-relations of yours have now seized their arms, struck camp, drawn their battle-line, and sounded the trumpet-note.\nYour impious sisters have drawn their swords, and are aiming at your jugular.\nThe calamities that oppress us are indeed direful, dearest Psyche.\nTake pity on yourself and on me; show dutiful self-control to deliver your house and your husband, your person and this tiny child of ours from the unhappy disaster that looms over us.\nDo not set eyes on, or open your ears to, these female criminals, whom you cannot call your sisters because of their deadly hatred, and because of the way in which they have trodden underfoot their own flesh and blood, when like Sireni they lean out over the crag, and make the rocks resound with the death-dealing cries!\u2019", "Meanwhile Psyche's unknown husband in their nightly conversation again counselled her with these words : \u2018Are you aware what immense danger overhangs you?\nFortuna is aiming her darts at you from long range and, unless you take the most stringent precautions, she will soon engage with you hand to hand.\nThose traitorous bitches are straining every nerve to lay wicked traps for you.\nAbove al, they are seeking to persuade you to pry into my appearance, and as I have often warned you, a single glimpse of it will be your last.\nSo if those depraved witches turn up later, ready with their destructive designs, and I am sure they will, you must not exchange a single word with them, or at any rate if your native innocence and soft-heartedness cannot bear that, you are not to listen to or utter a single word about your husband.\nSoon we shall be starting a family, for this as yet tiny womb of yours is carrying for us another child like yourself.\nIf you conceal our secret in silence, that child will be a god; but if you disclose it, he will be mortal.Psyche was aglow with delight at the news.\nShe gloried in the comforting prospect of a divine child, she exulted in the fame that such a dear one would bring her, she rejoiced at the thought of the respected status of mother.\nShe eagerly counted the mounting days and departing months, and as a novice bearing an unknown burden, she marvelled that the pinprick of a moment could cause such a lovely swelling in her fecund womb.", "\"But as they returned home, after Zephyrus with his serene breath had borne them aloft, they exchanged abusive comments about Psyche.\n\u2018There are no words, sister, to describe the outrageous lie of that idiotic girl.\nPreviously her husband was a young fellow whose beard was beginning to sprout with woolly growth, but now he's in middle wage with spruce and shining grey hair : What a prodigy he must be!\nThis short interval has brought on old age abruptly, and has changed his appearance!\nYou can be sure, sister, that this noxious female is either telling a pack of lies or does not know what her husband is like.\nWhatever the truth of the matter, she must be parted from those riches of hers without delay.\nIf she does not know what her husband looks like, she must certainly be married to a god, and its is a god she's got for us in that womb of hers.\nBe sure of this, that if she becomes a celebrity as the mother of a divine child--which God forbid--I'll put a rope round my neck and hang myself.\nFor the moment, then, let us go back to our parents and spin a fairy story to match the one we concocted a first.\u2019", "him as her son.\nAt the foot of the bed lay his bow, quiver, and arrows, the kindly weapons of that great god.", "She pressed seductive kisses on him, whispered honeyed words, and snuggled close to soften him.\nShe added endearments to her charms : \u2018O my honey-sweet, darling husband, light of your Psyche's life!Her husband unwillingly gave way before the forceful pressure of these impassioned whispers, and promised to do all she asked.\nThen, as dawn drew near, he vanished from his wife's embrace.", "Psyche (detail), Greco-Roman mosaic from Samanda\u011f\u0131 C3rd A.D., Hatay Archeology Museum", "Psyche had not yet finished speaking when her sister, goaded by mad lust and destructive envy, swung into action.\nShe devised a lying excuse to deceive her husband, pretending that she had learnt of her parents' death; she at once boarded ship, and then made hot-foot for the rock.\nAlthough the wrong wind was blowing, her eagerness was fired by blind hope, and she said : \u2018Take me, Cupidos, as your worthy wife; Zephyrus, take your mistress aboard!She then took a prodigious leap downward.\nBut not even in death could she reach that abode for her limbs bounced on the rocky crags, and were fragmented.\nHer insides were torn out, and in her fitting death she offered a ready meal to birds and beasts.\nThe second punitive vengeance was not long delayed.\nPsyche resumed her wandering, and reached a second city where her other sister similarly dwelt.\nShe too was taken in by her sister's deception, and in her eagerness to supplant Psyche in the marriage which they had befouled, she hastened to the rock, and fell to her deadly doom in the same way.", "This was how the reed, endowed with human qualities of openness and kindness, told Psyche in her extremity how to gain safety.\nShe did not disregard this careful instruction and suffer accordingly; she followed out every detail, and the theft was easily accomplished.\nShe gathered the soft substance of yellow gold in her dress, and brought it back to Venus.\nBut the hazard endured in this second trial won her no favourable acknowledgement from her mistress at least, for Venus frowned heavily, smiled harshly, and said : \u2018I know quite well that this too is the work of that adulterer.\nBut no I shall try you out in earnest, to see if you are indeed endowed with brave spirit and unique circumspection.\nDo you see that lofty mountain-peak, perched above a dizzily high cliff, from where the livid waters of a dark spring come tumbling down, and when enclosed in the basin of he neighbouring valley, water the marshes of the Styx and feed the hoarse streams of the Cocytus?\nI want you to hurry and bring me back in this small jug some icy water drawn from the stream's highest point, where it gushes out from within.\u2019", "But the warnings of heaven were to be obeyed, and unhappy Psyche's presence was demanded for her appointed punishment.\nSo amidst intense grief the ritual of that marriage with death was solemnized, and the entire populace escorted her living corpse as Psyche tearfully attended not her marriage but her funeral.\nBut when her sad parents, prostrated by their monstrous misfortune, drew back from the performance of their monstrous task, their daughter herself admonished them with these words : \u2018Why do you rack you sad old age with protracted weeping?\nOr why do you weary your life's breath, which is dearer to me than to yourselves, with repeated lamentations?\nWhy do you disfigure those features, which I adore, with ineffectual tears?\nWhy do you grieve my eyes by torturing your own?\nWhy do you tear at your grey locks?\nWhy do you beat those breasts so sacred to me?\nWhat fine rewards my peerless beauty will bring you!\nAll too late you experience the mortal wounds inflicted by impious envy.\nThat grief, those tears, that lamentations for me as one already lost should have been awakened when nations and communities brought me fame with divine honours, when with one voice they greeted me as the new Venus [Aphrodite].\nOnly now do I realize and see that my one undoing has been the title of Venus bestowed on me.\nEscort me and set me on the rock to which fate has consigned me.\nI hasten to behold this noble husband of mine.\nWhy should I postpone or shrink from the arrival of the person born for the destruction of the whole world?\u2019", "FAMILY OF PSYCHE PARENTS", "So Psyche, in suffering this reverse to her hopes, was now beset by a double grief.\nAs she retraced her steps, she noticed in a glimmering grove in the valley below an elegantly built shrine.\nNot wishing to disregard any means, however uncertain, which gave promise of brighter hope, and in her eagerness to seek the favour of any divinity whatsoever, she drew close to its sacred portals.\nThere she observed valuable offerings, and ribbons inscribed with gold letters pinned to the branches of trees and to the doorposts.\nThese attested the name of the goddess to whom they were dedicated, together with thanks for favours received.\nShe sank to her knees, and with her hands she grasped the altar still warm from a sacrifice.\nShe wiped away her tears, and then uttered this prayer [to Juno-Hera] : \u2018Sister and spouse of mighty Jupiter [Zeus], whether you reside in your ancient shrine at Samos, which alone can pride itself on your birth, your infant cries, and your nurture; or whether you occupy your blessed abode in lofty Carthage, which worships you as the maiden who tours the sky on a lion's back; or whether you guard the famed walls of the Argives, by the banks of the river-god Inachus, who now hymns you as bride of the Thunderer and as queen of all goddesses; you, whom all the East reveres as the yoking goddess, and whom all the West addresses as Lucina [goddess of childbirth], be for me in my most acute misfortunes Juno [Hera] Sospita (the Saviour), and free me from looming dangers in my weariness from exhausting toils.\nI am told that it is your practice to lend unsolicited aid", "This was how that far-sighted tower performed its prophetic role.\nPsyche immediately sped to Taenarus, and having duly obtained the coins and cakes she hastened down the path to Hades.\nShe passed the lame ass-driver without a word, handed the fare to the ferryman for the river crossing, ignored the entreaty of the dead man floating on the surface, disregarded the crafty pleas of the weavers, fed the cake to the dog [Cerberus] to quell his fearsome rage, and gained access to the house of Proserpina [Persephone].\nPsyche declined the soft cushion and the rich food offered by her hostess; she perched on the ground at her feet, and was content with plain bread.\nShe then reported her mission from Venus [Aphrodite].\nThe box was at once filled and closed out of her sight, and Psyche took it.\nShe quietened the dog's barking by disarming it with the second cake, offered her remaining coin to the ferryman, and quite animatedly hastened out of Hades.\nBut once she was back in the light of this world and had reverently hailed it, her mind was dominated by rash curiosity, in spite of her eagerness to see the end of her service.\nShe said : \u2018How stupid I am to be carrying this beauty-lotion fit for deities, and not take a single drop of it for myself, for with this at any rate I can be pleasing to my beautiful lover.\u2019", "Psyche, enticed by the charming appearance of these surroundings, drew nearer, and as her assurance grew she crossed the threshold.\nDelight at the surpassing beauty of the scene encouraged her to examine every detail.\nHer eyes lit upon store-rooms built high on the other side of the house; they were crammed with abundance of treasures.\nNothing imaginable was missing, and what was especially startling, apart from the breath-taking abundance of such riches, was the fact that this treasure-house had no protection whatever by way of chain or bar or guard.\nAs she gazed on all this with the greatest rapture, a disembodied voice addressed her : \u2018Why, may lady, do you gaze open-mouthed at this parade of wealth?\nAll these things are yours.\nSo retire to your room, relieve your weariness on your bed, and take a bath at your leisure.\nThe voices you hear are those of your handmaidens, and we will diligently attend to your needs.\nOnce you have completed your toilet a royal feast will at once be laid before you.\u2019", "She then laid a presumptuous hand on Psyche's hair, and dragged the girl in unresisting.\nAs soon as she was ushered in and presented before Venus' gaze, the goddess uttered the sort of explosive cackle typical of people in a furious rage.\nShe wagged her head, scratched her right ear, and said : \u2018Oh, so you have finally condescended to greet your mother-in-law, have you?\nOr is the purpose of this visit rather to see your husband, whose life is in danger from the wound which you inflicted?\nYou can rest assured that I shall welcome you as a good mother-in-law should.'\nThen she added : \u2018Where are my maids Sollicito (Melancholy) and Tristie (Sorrow)?They were called in, and the goddess consigned Psyche to them for

mistakenly calling him a son, for the wedding was not between a couple of equal status.\nBesides, ti took place in a country house, without witnesses and without a father's consent, so it cannot be

they duly did.\nAll this music soothed their spirits with the sweetest tunes as they listened, though no human person stood before them.\nBut those baleful sisters were not softened or lulled even by that music so honey-sweet.\nThey guided the conversation towards the deceitful snare which they had laid, and they began to enquire innocently about the status, family background, and walk of life of her husband.\nThen Psyche's excessive naivety made her forget her earlier version, and she concocted a fresh story.\nShe said that her husband was a business-man from an adjoining region, and that he was middle-aged, with streaks of grey in his hair.\nBut she did not linger a moment longer in such talk, but again loaded her sisters with rich gifts, and ushered them back to their carriage of the

curiosity about the owner of those divine possessions, about the identity and status of her husband.\nPsyche in her heart's depths did not in any way disobey or disregard her husband's instructions.\nShe invented an impromptu story that he was a handsome young man whose cheeks were just darkening with a soft beard, and who spent most of his day hunting in the hills of the countryside.\nBut she was anxious not to betray through a slip of the tongue her silent resolve by continuing the conversation, so she weighed her sisters down with gold artefacts and precious jewels,
