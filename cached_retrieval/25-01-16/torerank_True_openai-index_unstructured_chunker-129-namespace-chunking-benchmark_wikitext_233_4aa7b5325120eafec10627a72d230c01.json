["Although things seemed to start off smoothly when construction began on the bridge in 1834 things went downhill\nThe bridge was constructed fast and when completed in the spring of 1836 it was a wooden covered bridge at a length of 654 feet ( 199 m )\nWithin days of opening the bridge on April 9 1836 a storm blew through the valley destroying two of the bridges three piers and rendered the new bridge unusable\nAfter restarting construction later the bridge was redone using the same piers and in 1839 was completed and opened once again\nHowever in January 1841 another storm dubbed the Bridges Freshet of January 1841 blew through the valley destroying most of the bridges in the area and causing major damage to the structure from Riverton to Belvidere\nHowever this time the bridge survived the storm\nA local historian stated that because of the constant repairwork on the bridge itself the bridge company had never paid one dividend of money to its stockholders\nAlthough after society on both sides of the bridge began to live life with it money started flowing into the accounts of the stockholders", "= Riverton \u2013 Belvidere Bridge = The Riverton \u2013 Belvidere Bridge is a bridge crossing the Delaware River\nIt connects Belvidere New Jersey with Riverton Pennsylvania United States\nThere is no toll for crossing on either side after tolls were abolished by the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges in 1929\nThe bridge is 653 feet ( 199 m ) long holding a load of 8 short tons ( 16 @,@ 000 lb ) of traffic from County Route 620 Spur ( Water Street ) in Belvidere to former Pennsylvania Route 709 on the Riverton side\nThe bridge was first constructed in 1836 replacing the local ferry across the river\nThe board of freeholders in Warren County supported the replacement of the ferry with a bridge for safety of passengers\nIn 1832 the state created the Belvidere Delaware Bridge Company which was funded with the job of building a bridge from Riverton to Belvidere\nThe new covered bridge was built by Solon Chapin a contractor from Easton Pennsylvania\nThe bridge survived two large storms in 1836 and 1841 although sustained major damage both times\nIn 1903 the floods that destroyed bridges along the Delaware River Valley including taking out the entire covered structure at Riverton and Belvidere\nThey rebuilt the structure in 1904 using steel instead of wood and the new span has remained since with rehabilitations at certain points", "In 1903 the demise of wooden covered bridge would be seen as a storm dubbed the Pumpkin Flood of 1903 struck in October of that year\nThe storm struck both communities and the bridge in between causing the loss of many lives and on October 17 the toll collector on the bridge closed off the gate and did not allow any person to cross\nAt 6 : 40 that evening a crash was heard and seconds later the bridge was no more after tumbling into the Delaware River below\nRemnants of the bridge were swept downstream and smashed on the side of the new Northampton Street Bridge constructed just a few years before\nAfter the storm cleared the community of Belvidere put a ferry to Riverton back in almost immediately", "Original reports indicate that a ferry operated by a doctor who went by \" Dr. Belvidere \" once ran along the alignment of the Riverton \u2013 Belvidere Bridge\nThis ferry crossing one of the most dangerous parts of the Delaware was reported to have opened as early as 1802\nOn May 17 1825 the Board of Chosen Freeholders of the ferry permitted raising the rate to cross the river via ferry\nHowever by 1832 the ferry crossing was becoming dangerously busy and required a bridge be constructed in its place\nThat year the Belvidere Delaware Bridge Company was established

repairs began on the 25 @-@ year @-@ old structure\nThis construction included new beams for the bridge new flooring and an extensive repair to one bridge pier\nAlthough the construction had only taken four months to complete it still caused havoc in commuting across the structure\nIn 1940 the Pennsylvania approach to the bridge was designated as Pennsylvania Route 709 a designation that would last six years being decommissioned in 1946\nThe structure would face its most recent strength test in 1955 after the massive flooding from Hurricane Diane wreaked havoc in the area\nThe structure received minor damage in the flood and the traffic was only halted for a day or two afterward\nThe design in the 1904 plan worked as the structure was not at flood level", "= = = Construction of the

they hired to reconstruct the bridge the New Jersey Bridge Company of Manasquan New Jersey believed that the new bridge would need new abutments and piers to be completed by that time instead of using the old wooden bridge 's piers\nThe three piers from the wooden bridge were used and would require them to be heightened to be above any high flood waters\nOn June 3 1904 the bridge construction began on a barge in the river with promises to be complete by the set date of August 17\nOn August 17 the bridge was not complete but usable that when the Farmer 's Picnic ( the predecessor to the Warren
