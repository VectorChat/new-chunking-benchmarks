George Bancroft.\nIn September 1844 he traveled to neighboring Rhode Island, where he agitated for the release of Thomas Wilson Dorr, the leader of Dorr's Rebellion who had been sentenced to hard

supporting one.", "Film critics and academics have analysed Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... in several ways.\nIn the book, Encyclopedia of Religion and Film, Eric Mazur described several \"mythological subtexts\" in the film.\nWhile mentioning the opening scene of the film, which features the Raichand family worshiping \"Hindu deities during the annual Diwali holiday\", he explained that the scene allowed the Hindu audiences to participate in the darshan along with the characters.\nAuthor Rajani Mazumdar compared Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... to Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\n(1994) and added that the film dealt with themes of family and moral values through a \"spectacular stage that moves across global locations\".\nShe further stated that the buildup to the story was juxtaposed with the backdrop of two contrasting places \u2013 the Raichand home and the interiors of Chandni Chowk.\nWhile the Raichand house is described as \"expensive, almost like a museum\", Chandni Chowk is shown as a world of crowds, chaos and festivities.\nShe also made a note of the use of frontal camera angles in order to ensure that the \"spectators eye travels throughout the interior expanse\".\nWriter Sangita Gopal analysed the \"intensification of the aesthetic effects of Hindi cinema\" in the narrative scheme of the film.\nDuring the confrontation scene between Yash and Rahul Raichand, a \"thundering background score\" coupled with \"360\u00b0 panning shots\" were used to build up melodrama.\nShe added that while such scenes simply began by reprising previous face-offs in several melodramatic Hindi films (such as Mohabbatein of 2000), they gradually shifted \"to a more realist register as the framework moves from a sociology to a psychology of the family\".\nMazur mentioned the use of \"dream sequences\" in the film as a means of escapism.\nHe referred to the song \"Suraj Hua Maddham\" as an extradiegetic sequence that allowed Rahul and Anjali to be physically intimate \"in ways that they could not in the real world of the film.\"\nHe added that the characters conveyed a plethora of emotions not through extensive dialogue but through the exchange of glances, which were demonstrated by extreme close-ups on their eyes.\nWriting for the book Movie Blockbusters, Andrew Willis commented that the film was specifically written to appeal to the Indian diaspora.\nHe explained that the film was aimed at invoking nostalgia among the large section of NRIs in Canada, United Kingdom and North America.\nIn the second half of the film, Rahul and Anjali move to London, where they enjoy an affluent lifestyle, among several non-Indian neighbours and friends.\nHowever, there is a perpetual dissatisfaction among them, especially Anjali, in living away from home.\nAdditionally, she dresses up in a traditional sari and performs the duties of a loyal housemaker.\nShe also frets about her son and younger sister being \"too influenced\" by Western culture.\nThe film, thus tries to form an emotional connection with the expatriate Indian audiences.\nAccording to Eckstein several sequences convey a \"culturally conservative\" and \"idealistic image\" of India, while maintaining that the diaspora living in Britain lead a life of \"involuntary exile\".\nWestern ideology is equated with economic success, with emphasis on Western consumerism such as Starbucks and Burger King.\nCreekmur believes that Rohan was the only character in the film who could navigate multiple cultural spaces with ease.\nHe seems totally at ease both at his ancestral home in India and in London.\nThough the tagline for the film was \"It's all about loving your parents\", Creekmur was skeptical and suggested \"the film seems to actually admonish stern fathers to trust and love their children \u2014 mothers, aunties, and grandmothers, of course, love their children unconditionally even while respecting the idiotic wishes of vain patriarchs.\"",
