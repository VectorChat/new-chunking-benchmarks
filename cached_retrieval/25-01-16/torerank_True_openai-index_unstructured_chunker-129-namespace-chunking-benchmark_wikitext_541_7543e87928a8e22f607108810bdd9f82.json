Mudry a year behind Tatsuguchi at Loma Linda University later said \" I know him well\nI always thought Tatsuguchi \u2014 we called him Paul \u2014 was quite an American \"\nOn September 8 1938 Tatsuguchi graduated as a Doctor of Medicine and was awarded a California medical license\nThat same year he accepted a position at the Tokyo Adventist Sanitarium an institution founded in part by his father in 1928\nAs he would be working with tuberculosis patients in Tokyo Tatsuguchi spent several more months undergoing postgraduate medical studies in California\nAlso in 1938 Tatsuguchi married a childhood friend Taeko Miyake\nTaeko 's parents were serving as Adventist missionaries in Honolulu Hawaii while Taeko pursued studies in California\nPaul and Taeko departed the U.S. for Japan in 1939", "In Tokyo Tatsuguchi was aware of the rising tensions between Japan and the United States\nAlthough he was strongly loyal to his native country he also shared with Taeko a love of the US to which they hoped to return to live someday\nTatsuguchi concentrated on his work at the sanitorium and with Taeko supported activities for the Adventist church of which they were devout members\nIn 1940 their first daughter Joy Misako was born\nEarly the next year the IJA \u2013 the conscription authority in Japan \u2013 ordered Tatsuguchi to leave his medical practice and report to the First Imperial Guard Regiment ( FIGR ) in Tokyo where he was inducted with the rank of private on January 10 1941\nAs he was stationed in Tokyo Tatsuguchi was occasionally able to visit Taeko and Misako when his duties allowed\nMisako said of this time that \" I only have one memory of my father and that was playing hide and seek with him \"", "Tatsuguchi 's father Suichi Tatsuguchi was born and raised in Hiroshima Japan before leaving for the US in 1895 to \" explore the new world \"\nHe attended Healdsburg College later renamed Pacific Union College in Angwin California\nWhile attending the college he was baptized into the Seventh @-@ day Adventist Church\nIn 1907 after completing a course of study in dentistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in San Francisco Suichi Tatsuguchi returned to Hiroshima with plans to serve as a medical missionary\nIn Hiroshima Tatsuguchi established a prosperous dental practice and promoted the establishment of the Hiroshima Adventist church\nHe married Sadako Shibata who was also familiar with the US and spoke fluent English\nSuichi and Sadako had three sons and three daughters\nAll three sons would eventually attend school in the US\nThe middle son born on August 31 1911 was given the English name of Paul and the Japanese name of Nobuo although he was called \" Joseph \" at home", "After Tatsuguchi 's death his Japanese diary as well as his Bible a copy of Gray 's Anatomy and an address book were forwarded to the division intelligence section\nThere an American Nisei serviceman named Yasuo Sam Umetani drafted the first translation of the diary\nWord of the diary 's contents spread quickly through divisional headquarters to the other American troops on Attu\nAmericans were intrigued by the news that an American @-@ trained doctor had been with the Japanese forces on the island and that Tatsuguchi had described the battle from a Japanese perspective\nUnauthorized copies of both Umetani 's version and subsequent translations some of which contained variations were passed around among the American troops on Attu and to military installations on other Aleutian islands\nCivilian crews of transport ships in the area who obtained copies of the diary translation took their copies with them back to the continental US where it drew the attention of the press and gained wide public exposure", "Japanese forces had first occupied Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands on June 7 1942 during the Battle of Midway\nThey abandoned Attu in September 1942 but then decided to reoccupy it\nA regiment of IJA soldiers from the Northern Sea Detachment ( \u5317\u6d77\u652f\u968a Hokkai Shitai ) a detachment of Imperial Japanese Navy Special Naval Landing Force troops and support personnel began arriving on Attu in October 1942\nThe total number of Japanese on the island would eventually be between 2 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 900 men\nExactly when Tatsuguchi arrived on Attu is unclear because he was forbidden from specifying dates in the letters he wrote to Taeko but it was probably between November 1942 and January 1943\nHe was assigned to the Northern 5216 Detachment North Sea Defense Hospital", "With an American naval blockade in place mail between Attu and Japan was infrequent and unscheduled\nTatsuguchi received several small packages from Taeko containing cookies and ointment for his skin which was chafed by Attu 's severe winter winds\nFour letters and several postcards from Tatsuguchi reached Taeko\nAs he was forbidden from discussing his unit 's exact location or mission Tatsuguchi wrote about the weather the beauty of the snowy and mountainous landscape around him and his success in catching fish\nHe was cheered by the news from Taeko that their second daughter Laura Mutsuko was born in February\nTatsuguchi reminded Taeko in his letters to play classical music for their daughters\nWhether he kept his diary during this time is unclear for the only known diary entries by Tatsuguchi began in May after the American landings to retake the island", "Tatsuguchi 's diary was recovered by American forces and translated into English\nCopies of the translation were widely disseminated and publicized in the US after the battle\nThe American public was intrigued by a Christian American @-@ trained doctor serving with Japanese forces on the island and by his apparent participation in assisting with the deaths of wounded Japanese soldiers in his field hospital during the battle 's final days\nTranslated excerpts from Tatsuguchi 's diary have been widely quoted in Western historical accounts of the battle especially his final entry in which he recorded a farewell message to his family", "Tatsuguchi reached Rabaul on October 4 1942\nHis stay there was probably short for his wife recorded that he joined her in Tokyo that same month prior to being redeployed\nTatsuguchi was unable to tell his wife now pregnant with their second child where he would be assigned but she noticed that he studied maps of the North Pacific area\nAt one point he remarked to Taeko that he was going to an area where he might meet some of his former classmates from California", "Several American newspapers published excerpts from the diary and most highlighted the possibility that Tatsuguchi a professed Christian might have been involved in the killing of wounded patients\nThe Chicago Tribune on September 9 1943 published an article headlined \" Japs Slew Own Patients on Attu Diary Discloses \"\nIn contrast the Loma Linda School of Medicine Alumni Journal defended Tatsuguchi as a gentle and caring doctor who was trapped in a situation beyond his control where his actions violated neither his religious beliefs nor his oaths as a doctor\nMost Western historical accounts of the Battle of Attu mention Tatsuguchi and quote from his diary especially the final entry", "J. Mudry and another of Tatsuguchi 's Loma Linda classmates J. L. Whitaker were medical officers with the US Seventh Division on Attu during the battle\nWhitaker was in the path of Yamasaki 's final attack but survived without injury\nWhitaker and Mudry were stunned to later learn that their former classmate was on the island with Japanese forces and was killed nearby", "The Japanese government notified Taeko of her husband 's death in August 1943\nTaeko and her two daughters survived the remainder of the war on a small widow 's pension and with help from relatives\nTaeko hoped that her husband was still alive and would return\nJust after the war ended B. P. Hoffman one of Tatsuguchi 's former college instructors and a friend of Taeko 's visited her in Osaka where she was living\nHoffman told her that a US Federal Bureau of Investigation agent had visited him during the war because Hoffman 's name was in Tatsuguchi 's address book found on Attu\nThe agent told the story of Tatsuguchi 's death to Hoffman who related it to Taeko\nTaeko accepted that her husband would not be coming back\nAfter the war Taeko worked for the American occupation forces as a secretary and teacher\nIn 1954 she and her two daughters Joy and Laura left Japan and joined Taeko 's parents in Hawaii\nAll three became naturalized citizens of the US\nJoy and Laura both attended Pacific Union College and became nurses\nJoy later married a Japanese man and returned to Japan to live\nLaura married an American and moved to the Los Angeles area where Taeko later joined her\nIn 2005 Taeko told Kyodo News of her husband \" He was a faithful Christian doctor and a gentleman who devoted himself to God and communities \"", "By May 28 about a thousand Japanese remained compressed into a small pocket\nYamasaki apparently realizing that help from Japan was not forthcoming decided on one last desperate measure to try to save his command from destruction\nOn May 29 Yamasaki organized a surprise attack on American positions\nYamasaki hoped to break through the enemy 's front lines and seize the American artillery batteries which would then be turned on the rest of the American forces and their ships offshore\nTatsuguchi 's last diary entry records Yamasaki 's order the disposition of the wounded in his hospital and a farewell message to his family :", "A few weeks after Tatsuguchi left for his new assignment the IJA delivered a lock of his hair to Taeko\nThe IJA did this whenever soldiers were sent to a high @-@ risk combat area in case the soldier was killed and it proved impossible to repatriate the remains for proper funeral rites", "Yamasaki launched his attack early in the morning on May 30\nAlthough the attack succeeded in penetrating the enemy lines American rear @-@ area personnel rallied and killed Yamasaki and the majority of his attacking troops\nMost of the remaining Japanese then committed suicide ; only 27 were taken prisoner\nTwo versions exist of how Tatsuguchi died\nOne version is that he did not participate in the attack\nLater in the day on May 30 two American soldiers Charles W. Laird and John Hirn who were searching for remaining Japanese forces following the defeat of Yamasaki 's attack approached the cave containing Tatsuguchi 's field hospital\nTatsuguchi emerged from the cave waving his Bible in the direction of the Americans and yelling in English \" Don 't shoot !\nI am a Christian ! \"\nLaird heard and understood what Tatsuguchi was saying and withheld fire\nHirn however shot and killed Tatsuguchi\nHirn later stated that he could not hear what Tatsuguchi was saying over the wind and noise of battle and that he thought that the Bible Tatsuguchi was holding was a weapon", "On May 14 American artillery fired phosphorus smoke shells to mark Japanese positions in the mountains\nMany Japanese and many Americans believed these were poison gas shells\nTatsuguchi noted in his diary that \" In the enemy the U.S.\nForces used gas but no damage was done on account of strong wind \"\nTatsuguchi recorded in his diary that he was forced to move his field hospital into a cave to escape American naval and aerial bombardment\nHe relocated the hospital and patients several times as the Japanese forces were pushed back by the Americans\nHis May 17 entry describes one of the moves :", "The other version was told to Taeko and Laura by Charles Laird in 1984\nLaird a former US Army sergeant who served on Attu stated that he was sleeping in a tent the morning of May 30 when Yamasaki 's troops broke through the American front lines\nA man ran into Laird 's tent and Laird shot and killed him only to discover that the man was American\nThen he saw eight Japanese soldiers approaching through the fog so he shot and killed them too\nOne of them was Tatsuguchi\nLaird said that he found Tatsuguchi 's diary and an address book in which he was shocked to see American names and addresses", "Tatsuguchi refers again and again in his diary to the constant intense attacks by American aircraft and artillery on his comrades ' positions\nOn May 21 he noted that he \" was strafed when amputating a patient 's arm \" and on May 23 that \" by naval gun fire a hit was scored on the pillar pole of tents for patients and the tents gave in and killed two
