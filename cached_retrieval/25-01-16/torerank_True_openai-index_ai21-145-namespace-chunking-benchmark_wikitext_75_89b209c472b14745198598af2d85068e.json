base.\nAmanita section Amanita consists of A. muscaria and its close relatives, including A. pantherina (the panther cap), A. gemmata, A. farinosa, and A. xanthocephala.\nModern fungal taxonomists have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy.\nTwo recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.", "There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.\n= = Taxonomy and naming = = The name of the mushroom in many European languages is thought to be derived from its use as an insecticide when sprinkled in milk.\nThis practice has been recorded from Germanic- and Slavic-speaking parts of Europe, as well as the Vosges region and pockets elsewhere in France, and Romania.\nAlbertus Magnus was the first to record it in his work De vegetabilibus some time before 1256, commenting vocatur fungus muscarum, eo quod in lacte pulverizatus interficit muscas, \"it is called the fly mushroom because it is powdered in milk to kill flies.\"", "Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A. caesarea-like species in Mexico.\nAmanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric.\nFurthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white.\nThe volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales.", "It clarified exactly what crimes constituted treason, following earlier, somewhat \" over zealous \" interpretations of England's legal codes.\nFor instance, high treason could be committed by anyone found to be compassing the king's death or counterfeiting his coin.", "High treason remained distinct though, from what became known as petty treason: the killing of a lawful superior, such as a husband by his wife.\nThough twelfth century contemporary authors made few attempts to differentiate between high treason and petty treason, enhanced punishments may indicate that the latter was treated more seriously than an ordinary felony.\nAs the most egregious offence an individual could commit, viewed as seriously as though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment.\nBut whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned.\nIn his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, \"to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive\", was \"full as terrible to the sensation as the other\".", "In 1786, Phoebe Harris and her accomplices were \"indicted, for that they, on the 11th of February last, one piece of false, feigned, and counterfeit money and coin, to the likeness and similitude of the good, legal, and silver coin of this realm, called a shilling, falsely, deceitfully, feloniously, and traiterously did counterfeit and coin\".\nWatched by a reported 20,000 people, she was led to the stake and stood on a stool, where a noose, attached to an iron bolt driven into the top of the stake, was placed around her neck.\nAs prayers were read, the stool was taken away and over the course of several minutes, her feet kicking as her body convulsed, Harris choked to death.", "His performance was considered a surprise, due to having a poor spring training.\nAlthough he pitched well in his first game of the season, he quickly lost his form, and by May 18, his ERA had risen to 5.06 and had a 1\u20132 record.\nIt was at this point in the season that he began to turn his fortunes around and regained his effectiveness, and by August 12 he had lowered his ERA to 1.90.\nHis season totals included a 2.47 ERA and a 7\u20135 win-loss record, both career bests, and added six saves in 80 innings pitched.", "But while 18th and 19th-century women guilty of treasonable crimes were still seen as villains, increasingly, the cause of their descent was ascribed to villainous men.\nThose people concerned about the brutality inflicted on condemned women were, in Gatrell's opinion, \"activated by the sense that even at their worst women were creatures to be pitied and protected from themselves, and perhaps revered, like all women from whom men were born.\"\nCommenting on Harris's execution, The Daily Universal Register claimed that the act reflected \"a scandal upon the law\", \"a disgrace to the police\" and \"was not only inhuman, but shamefully indelicate and shocking\".", "The burning in 1789 of Christian Murphy, for coining, received practically no attention from the newspapers (perhaps owing to practical limitations on how much news they could publish across only four pages), but it may have been enacted by Sir Benjamin Hammett, a former sheriff of London.\nHammett was also an MP, and in 1790 he introduced to Parliament a Bill for Altering the Sentence of Burning Women.\nHe denounced the punishment as \"the savage remains of Norman policy\" which \"disgraced our statutes\", as \"the practice did the common law\".\nHe also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution.", "On March 18, 1964, it was announced that Sisler retired from baseball to join an Investment company.\nAfter his baseball career, Sisler became an executive with the investment firm A.G. Edwards for more than 30 years, reaching the level of vice-chairman.\nA.G. Edwards was a sponsor of a semi-professional baseball team located in St. Petersburg, Florida; when the 'Stockbrokers' were invited to play in season-ending tournament to decide a champion, Sisler, a senior executive for the firm, denied the funding for the team, forcing them to decline if no other monies were raised.", "In the archaeological record, there is considerable evidence of occupation to the north of Aldwych, but much along the former foreshore has been covered by rubble from the demolition of the Tudor Somerset Place, a former royal residence, to create a large platform for the building of the first Somerset House, in the 17th century.\nThe landmark Eleanor's Cross was built in the 13th century at the western end of the Strand at Charing Cross by Edward I commemorating his wife Eleanor of Castile.\nIt was demolished in 1647 by the request of Parliament during the First English Civil War, but reconstructed in 1865.", "Savoy Palace was the London residence of John of Gaunt, King Richard II's uncle and the nation's power broker.\nIn the 14th century the Savoy was the most magnificent nobleman's mansion in England.\nDuring the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, rebels, led by Wat Tyler, inflamed by opposition to the poll tax promoted by John of Gaunt, systematically demolished the Savoy and everything in it.", "York House was built as the London residence for the Bishop of Norwich not later than 1237.\nAt the time of the Reformation it was acquired by King Henry VIII and came to be known as York House when he granted it to the Archbishop of York in 1556.\nIn the 1620s it was acquired by the royal favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and after an interlude during the Civil War it was returned to George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who sold it to developers in 1672.", "The starting date for all the mycota had been set by general agreement as January 1, 1821, the date of Fries's work, and so the full name was then Amanita muscaria (L.: Fr.)\nHook.\nThe 1987 edition of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered valid as far back as May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work.\nHence, Linnaeus and Lamarck are now taken as the namers of Amanita muscaria (L.)

King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro's theory in the 1970 book A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth; he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in the Middle East, even though cedars and pines are found there, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro.\nHe concludes that if the theory was true, the use of the mushroom must have been \" the best kept secret in the world \" as it was so well concealed for two thousand years.", "In the 18th century, coffee and chop houses were established on the street; Twinings was established at No.\n206 in 1706 by Thomas Twining, supplier of tea to Queen Anne.\nThe company claims to be the oldest ratepayer in Westminster.", "Carlson's only praise was for songs \"Odyssey #5\" and \"My Happiness\", stating that \"[t]oo often, Powderfinger is too earnest, a bit too careful in their career\".\nCarlson noted that despite his critique, the album achieved some success in the American market.\nDevon Powers of PopMatters complimented Fanning's vocals, and said the focus of the album was \"meaty, rolling ballads\".\nPowers said that many of the songs on the album were \"the kind of songs you put on repeat for hours, or days\".\nThe main critique was for the \"faster numbers\", stating that \"Like a Dog\" \"sounds mostly a little bored\".\nThe review concluded by noting that the best songs on Odyssey were those not available as \"fleeting radio singles and background music\".", "In the 19th century, much of the Strand was rebuilt and the houses to the south no longer backed onto the Thames, separated from the river by the Victoria Embankment constructed in 1865 \u2013 70 and reclaiming 37 acres (15 ha) of land.\nThe street became well known for theatres, and at one point contained more than any other; including the Tivoli Music Hall at No.\n65, the Adelphi, Gaiety, Savoy, Terry's and Vaudeville.", "His bill, by no means the first such attempt to end the public burning of women, led to the Treason Act 1790, which abolished the sentence.\n= = Crimes punishable by burning = = = Treason = = = By the end of the thirteenth century, several offences against either one's lord, or one's king, were treasonable.\nHigh treason, defined as transgressions against the sovereign, was first codified during King Edward III's reign by the Treason Act 1351.", "In 1512 it was rebuilt as the Savoy Hospital for the poor.\nIt gradually fell into dereliction and was divided into multiple tenancies.\nIt was demolished in 1816 \u2013 20 to build the approach road to Waterloo Bridge, eventually being demolished in the 19th century.\nThe Savoy Hotel now occupies this site.", "Indian scholars Santosh Kumar Dash and Sachinanda Padhy pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were proscribed, using as a source the Manusm\u015brti.\nIn 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson's theory and noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma.\nIn his 1976 survey, Hallucinogens and Culture, anthropologist Peter T.
