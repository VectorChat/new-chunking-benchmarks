["Between the launching of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941 and the following spring, 2.8 million of the 3.2 million prisoners taken died while in German hands.\n[101] The German failure to attain their anticipated victory in the East led to significant shortages of labor for German war production and, beginning in 1942, prisoners of war in the eastern POW camps \u2013 primarily Soviets \u2013 were seen as a source of slave labor to keep Germany's wartime economy running.\n[101] On 6 August 1941, the OKW declared that Soviet POWs capable of work were to receive 2,200 calories/day and those not capable of work 2,040 calories/day.\n[102] On 21 October 1941, the OKW ordered a huge reduction in the food rations for Soviet POWs, with POWs incapable of work henceforth to receive only 1,490 calories/day.\nIn a meeting of senior generals called at Or\u0161a on 13 November 1941, the Army's First quarter-master General Eduard Wagner stated \"Non-working prisoners of war in the camps are to starve\".\n[103]", "In Order No.\n24 dated 24 November 1941, the commander of the 707th Division declared:", "The order was in line with the interests of the Wehrmacht command, which was eager

Command (Oberkommando des Heeres \u2013 OKH), slightly modified the assumptions of the \"Barbarossa Jurisdiction\".\nHis orders were to use the jurisdiction only in cases where the discipline of the army would not suffer.\n[citation needed] Contrary to what was claimed after the war, the Wehrmacht generals such as Heinz Guderian, did not intend to mitigate the records of the jurisdiction of an order, or in any way violate Hitler's intentions.\n[19] His command was intended solely to prevent individual excesses which could damage discipline within army ranks, without changing the extermination intentions of the order.\n[18] As part of the policy of harshness towards Slavic \"sub-humans\" and to prevent any tendency towards seeing the enemy as human, German troops were ordered to go out of their way to mistreat women and children in Russia.\n[31]", "Informational notes", "Analysis of photos and letters [ edit ]", "Evolving analysis [ edit ]", "'Citations Bibliography", "The

in 1929, while the USSR and Japan did not sign until after the war (the final version of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949).\nThis meant that Germany was legally obliged to treat all POWs according to it, while in turn, Germans captured by the Red Army could not expect to be treated in such a manner.\nThe Soviet Union and Japan did not treat prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention.\nWhile the Wehrmacht's prisoner-of-war camps for inmates from the west generally satisfied the humanitarian requirement prescribed by international law, prisoners from Poland (which never capitulated) and the USSR were incarcerated under significantly worse conditions.\n[98] By December 1941, more than 2.4 million Soviet Red Army troops had been taken prisoner.\nThese men suffered from malnutrition and diseases such as typhus that resulted from the Wehrmacht's failure to provide sufficient food, shelter, proper sanitation and medical care.\nPrisoners were regularly subject to torture, beatings and humiliation.\nAll Jews, commissars, \"intellectuals\" and Muslims serving in the Red Army were either executed by the Wehrmacht or handed over to the SS to be shot.\n[99]",

special measures [an euphemism for killing] which are to be carried out free from bureaucratic and administrative influence and with a willingness to accept responsibility.\nWhile so far the regulations and orders concerning prisoners of war were based solely on military considerations, now the political objective must be attained, which is to protect the German nation from Bolshevik inciters and forthwith take the occupied territory strictly in hand.\n[16] As such, all Soviet POWs considered to be commissars together with all Jewish POWs were to be handed over to the Einsatzgruppen to be shot.\n[16] The OKW attached great importance to the killings of POWs believed to be commissars as it was believed that if the captured commissars reached POW camps in Germany that they would stage another German Stab-in-the-back myth (Dolchsto\u00df) like that believed to have caused Germany's defeat in World War I.\nBetween July\u2013October 1941, between 580,000\u2013600,000 POWs in Wehrmacht custody were turned over to the SS to be killed.\n[16] In September 1941, both Helmuth James von Moltke and Admiral Wilhelm Canaris wrote memos pointing out to

between Germans and foreign slave workers.\n[33] In accordance to these new racial laws issued by the Nazis; in November 1941, the commander of the 18th Panzer Division warned his soldiers not to have sex with \"sub-human\" Russian women, and ordered that any Russian women found having sex with a German soldier was to be handed over to the SS to be executed at once.\n[34] A decree ordered on 20 February 1942 declared that sexual intercourse between a German woman and a Russian worker or prisoner of war would result in the latter being punished by the death penalty.\n[35] During the war, hundreds of Polish and Russian men were found guilty of \"race defilement\" for their relations with German women and were executed.\n[36][37]", "In particular, both Moltke and Admiral Canaris noted that the German claim that Soviet POWs had no rights because the Soviet Union had not ratified the Geneva Convention was invalid as Germany had ratified the Geneva Convention and thus under international law was obliged to provide humane treatment for the POWs in its care.\nIn response, Field-Marshal Wilhelm Keitel wrote: \"These scruples accord with the soldierly concepts of a

this comment was written in an open communication which passes through many hands.\nIt would have been far better if the report had not been written at all.\n[68]", "Commissar Order [ edit ] The order cast the war against the Soviet Union as one of ideological and racial differences, and it provided for the immediate liquidation of political commissars in the Red Army.\n[14] The order was formulated on Hitler's behalf in 1941 by the Wehrmacht command and distributed to field commanders.\n[15] General Franz Halder, contrary to what he claimed after the war, did not oppose the Commissar Order,[citation needed] and instead welcomed it writing that \"Troops must participate in the ideological battle in the Eastern campaign to the end\".\n[15] The enforcement of the Commissar Order led to thousands of executions.\nThe German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster was to write in 1989 that it was simply not true as most German Army commanders claimed in their memoirs and some German historians like Ernst Nolte were still claiming that the Commissar Order was not enforced.\n[15]", "In August 1941, following the protests by two Lutheran chaplains about the massacre of a group of

1941,[18] where he declared that war against Soviet Russia would be a war of extermination, in which both the political and intellectual elites of Russia would be eradicated by German forces, in order to ensure a long-lasting German victory.\nHitler underlined that executions would not be a matter for military courts, but for the organised action of the military.\n[18] The decree, issued by Field Marshal Keitel a few weeks before Operation Barbarossa, exempted punishable offenses committed by enemy civilians (in Russia) from the jurisdiction of military justice.\nSuspects were to be brought before an officer who would decide if they were to be shot.\nProsecution of offenses against civilians by members of the Wehrmacht was decreed to be \"not required\" unless necessary for the maintenance of discipline.\n[citation needed]", "In the summer of 1942, there was an illusory liberalization of the treatment of captured political officers.\nOn 10 June, the Gestapo chief Heinrich M\u00fcller issued an order on the segregation of prisoners and ordered that commissars be isolated from the rest of the prisoners and sent to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.\nHowever, this did not change the plight of commissars much, as Mauthausen was one of the worst Nazi concentration camps where they usually waited for a slow death.\nOn 20 October 1942, M\u00fcller again ordered commissars captured in battle to be shot on the spot.\nOnly those commissars who were identified as deserters were sent to Mauthausen.\nIn the following months reports continued to be filed regarding the executions of Soviet commissars.\n[18] The last known account of the liquidation of a political officer came from units of Army Group South in July 1943.\n[18]", "The Muslim POWs were shot because they were circumcised, and therefore might be Jewish; it was felt to be safer to simply shoot all circumcised POWs rather run the risk that a Jewish POW might escape execution by claiming to be a Muslim.\n[99] Reflecting the close co-operation between the Wehrmacht and the SS was an Einsatzgruppen report, which read: In Borispol, following a demand by the Commandant of the local P/W camp, a platoon of Sonderkommando 4 shot 752 Jewish prisoners of war on 14 October and 356 on 16 October 1941 including several commissars and 78 wounded Jews handed over by the camp medical officer.\n[99] According to a RHSA report of 5 December 1941, the Wehrmacht had since 22 June handed over to the Einsatzgruppen 16, 000 Soviet POWs to be \"liquidated\".\n[100] A Typical of the Wehrmacht's treatment of Soviet POWs were the reports of the 11th Army commanded by Erich von Manstein on the \"wastage\" rates in the first half of 1942.\nAccording to the reports:[100]", "Human experimentation [ edit ]", "5.7 million Soviet soldiers were taken prisoner during the war, of whom at least 3.3 million (58 percent of the total) died in captivity.\n[104]", "The Wehrmacht also worked very closely with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering members of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union.\nOn October 10, 1941 General Walther von Reichenau drafted an order to be read to the troops under his command stating that: \"the soldier must achieve full understanding of the necessity for a harsh but just vengeance against Jewish subhumanity.\n\"[75] Upon hearing of Reichenau's Severity Order, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group South announced his \"complete agreement\" with it, and sent out a circular to all of the Army generals under his command urging them to send out their own versions of the Severity Order, which would impress upon the troops the need to exterminate Jews.\n[76] Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942", "Much more evidence of such trends and thoughts among Wehrmacht soldiers exists and is subject to research by historians.\n[205]", "In Soviet Russia rapes were only a concern if they undermined military discipline.\n[89] Since 1941, rape was theoretically punishable with the death sentence, although rapes were rarely prosecuted in practice and rapes by Germans of non-German women were not taken seriously, nor was it punishable by death, especially in the eastern European territories.\n[86]:288 In October 1940 the laws on rape were changed, making it a \"petitioned crime\" \u2013 that is a crime for which punishment had to be requested.\nHistorian Christa Paul writes that this resulted in \"a nearly complete absence of prosecution and punishment for rape\".\n[86]:288 There were rape cases in the east where the perpetrators were sentenced if the rape was highly visible, damaging to the image of the German Army and the courts were willing to pass a condemning verdict against the accused.\n[86]:289 According to the historian Regina M\u00fchlh\u00e4user, the Wehrmacht also used sexual violence and undressing in numerous cases of interrogations.\n[95] M\u00fchlh\u00e4user adds that the number of illegitimate children born in the occupied regions did not exceed the prewar time.\nShe comes to the conclusion that rapes on the Eastern front were not singular cases but has to admit that the state of source material is very poor.\n[96]", "In 1986, the German historian Hans Mommsen wrote about the role of the Wehrmacht under National Socialism:", "The leadership of the Wehrmacht rather willingly made themselves into accomplices in the policy of extermination.\nIt did this by generating the \"criminal orders\" and implementing them.\nBy no means did they merely passively support the implementation of their concept, although there was a certain reluctance for reasons of military discipline and a few isolated protests.\nTo construct a \"casual nexus\" over all this amounts in fact to steering away from the decisive responsibility of the military leadership and the bureaucratic elites.\n[179]", "Forced labor [ edit ]", "Retreat from France [ edit ]", "Beyond that, Operation Barbarossa had been portrayed in Germany as a \"preventive war\" forced on Germany by Soviet attack alleged to be planned for July 1941.\n[172] This claim was widely believed in the Reich during the war, and indeed was so popular that as late as the 1950s some West German historians were still arguing Operation Barbarossa was a \"preventive war\".\n[172] As a result of this view of Operation Barbarossa, for many Germans, violence inflicted by the Wehrmacht on Soviet civilians and POWs was seen as something that the Soviets had brought down on themselves, hence the absence of any guilt on the part of many Germans.\n[173] Cold War priorities and taboos about revisiting the most unpleasant aspects of World War II meant that the Wehrmacht's role in war crimes was not seriously re-examined until the early 1980s.\n[174][175]", "Date Died/shot Escaped Handed over", "The Night and Fog Decree, issued by Hitler in 1941 and disseminated along with a directive from Keitel, was operated within the conquered territories in the West (Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands).\nThe decree allowed those \"endangering German security\" to be seized and made to disappear without trace.\nKeitel's directive stated that \"efficient intimidation can only be achieved either by capital punishment or by measures by which the relatives of the criminal and the population do not know his fate.\n\"[20]", "On 3 May 1941, the Foreign Ministry of the Polish Government in Exile in London issued a document describing the mass raids carried out in Polish cities with the aim of capturing young women, who were later forced to work in brothels attended by German officers and soldiers.\n[53] In the Soviet Union women were kidnapped by German forces for prostitution; one report by the

and vigorous measures against Bolshevik inciters, guerrillas, saboteurs, Jews, and the complete elimination of all active and passive resistance.\n\"[21] Influenced by the guidelines, in a directive sent out to the troops under his command, General Erich Hoepner of the Panzer Group 4 stated: The war against Russia is an important chapter in the German nation's struggle for existence.\nIt is the

this publication includes authentic letters from soldiers on the Eastern front.\nTo give an example of the intensive indoctrination \"that transcends the mere results of military service\", researchers Judith Levin and Daniel Uziel quote a German soldier writing:", "One SS man who saw the killings at Byelaya Tserkov described them as follows: I went to the woods alone.\nThe Wehrmacht had already dug a grave.\nThe children were brought along in a tractor.\nI had nothing to do with this technical procedure.\nThe Ukrainians were standing around trembling.\nThe children were taken down from the tractor.\nThey were lined up along the top of the grave and shot so that they fell into it.\nThe Ukrainians did not aim at any particular part of the body.\nThey fell into the grave.\nThe wailing was indescribable.\nI shall never forget the scene throughout my life.\nI find it very hard to bear.\nI particularly remember a small fair-haired girl who took me by the hand.\nShe too was shot later..\nThe grave was near some woods.\nIt was not near the rifle-range.\nThe execution must had taken place in the afternoon at about 3.30 or 4.00.\nIt took place the day after the discussions at the Feldkommandanten...Many children were hit four or five times before they died.\n[69]", "In the summer of 1940, Reinhard Heydrich, the chief of the Reich Main Security Office (including the Gestapo), noted that: \"...compared to the crimes, robberies and excesses committed by the army [part of the Wehrmacht], the SS and the police don't look all that bad\".\n[42] Even when the German Army was not involved in war crimes, all of the top military leaders were aware of what was happening in Poland.\nNone objected on moral principles; the few who did object did so due to concerns about discipline.\n[38] Moreover, the general who objected the loudest to war crimes in Poland, General Johannes von Blaskowitz, was opposed to the Army committing war crimes with the SS, not the idea of atrocities against Poland.\n[43] The Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that Blaskowitiz was actually \"legitimizing murder\" by expressing approval of SS massacres while demanding that the Army be kept out of the massacres as damaging to discipline.\nBartov wrote that once officers and troops saw that murder was \"legitimate\" in Poland, the effect was that the Army tended to copy the SS.\n[44]", "Bartov also wrote that German film-makers liked to show the heroic last stand of the 6th Army at Stalingrad, but none has so far showed the 6th Army's massive co-operation with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering Soviet Jews in 1941 during its march across the Ukraine.\n[197] Likewise, Bartov commented that German films tended to dwell on the suffering of the 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad and its aftermath without reflecting on the fact that it was the Germans who invaded the Soviet Union and that the Russians were fighting to defend their country.\n[197] Bartov went on to state that as late as the 1991 film Mein Krieg (My War), featuring interview footage of six German veterans juxtaposed with their amateur films the veterans shot during the war, contains strong hints that the interviewees saw and/or were involved in war crimes with at one point a mass grave of civilians in Russia being glimpsed in the background of one of the amateur films; but the point is not pressed by the film-makers.\n[198]", "The prosecution of war crimes lost momentum during the 1950s as the Cold War intensified; both German states needed to establish armed forces and could not do so without trained officers and soldiers that had served in the Wehrmacht.\nGerman historiography in the 1950s viewed war crimes by German soldiers as exceptional rather than ordinary; soldiers were seen as victims of the Nazi regime.\nTraces of this attitude can still be seen in some German works today, which minimize the number of soldiers who took part in Nazi crimes.\n[171] This was especially the case as the German public in the immediate post-war period were more interested in seeing themselves rather than others as victims.\n[172] Thus the subject of Red Army atrocities against German civilians in 1944\u201345 received vastly more popular and historical interest in the 1950s than did the subject of Wehrmacht atrocities against Soviet civilians in 1941\u201344.\n[172]", "Some German officers had considered Communism in the Soviet Union to be a Jewish plot even before the Third Reich.\nIn 1918, Karl von Bothmer, the German Army's plenipotentiary in Moscow called the Bolsheviks \"a gang of Jews\" and expressed the desire \"to see a few hundred of these louts hanging on the Kremlin wall\".\n[61] Evaluations of the Red Army by the visiting Reichswehr officers during the period of German-Soviet co-operation in the 1920s often show anti-Semitism with comments about the \"Jewish slyness\" of General Lev Snitman or the \"Jewish blood\" of General Leonid Vajner being very typical.\n[61] In 1932, Ewald Banse, a leading German professor and a member of the National Association for the Military Sciences (a group secretly financed by the Reichswehr) wrote in a pamphlet calling for \"intellectual world domination\" by Germany wrote that the Soviet leadership was mostly Jewish who dominated an apathetic and mindless Russian masses.\n[62] In 1935, Colonel Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel in a report about the military capacity of the Red Army wrote that the commissars were \"mostly of the Jewish race\".\n[63]"]
