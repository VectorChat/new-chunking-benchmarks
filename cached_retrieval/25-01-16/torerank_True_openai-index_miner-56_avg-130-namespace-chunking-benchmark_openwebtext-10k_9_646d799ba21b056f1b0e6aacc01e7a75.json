in terms of the conventional conceptual metaphor \u201cPAIN IS CAUSE OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE\u201d.\nLike sharp, drilling is also one of the descriptors for pain that are included in the MPQ.\nIndeed, the description of the character's pain as drilling in the extract above is unlikely to be perceived as particularly creative, let alone as a one-off.\nOn the other hand, however, this use of drilling is much less conventional than the use of sharp I discussed earlier.", "This arguably creates the conditions for a rich simulation of the kind described by Gibbs (2006b Gibbs, R.W.\nJr. 2006b.\nMetaphor
