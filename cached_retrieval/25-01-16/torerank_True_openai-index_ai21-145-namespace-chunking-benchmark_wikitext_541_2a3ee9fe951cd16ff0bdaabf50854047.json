the highway into the Quonset Business Park and the construction of several overpasses in Quonset, an exit ramp to Gate Road, a full interchange with U.S. Route 1 in North Kingstown, and a partial diamond interchange with West Davisville Road in Davisville.\nDuring Phase 1's construction, traffic was maintained on the existing Route 403 (Devil's Foot Road); the only major alteration to the

northbound lanes of Route 4 via the newly constructed Exit 7.\nLike the original Route 403, the nominally east-west freeway follows a northeastern-southwestern route for much of its length.\nShortly after beginning at Route 4, Route 403 crosses over Route 402 and the Hunt River on a single-span bridge, entering the town of North Kingstown.\nThe relocation of Route 403 removed access to Route 402;

1974.\nAfter the closure of the base, the Quonset Point region of North Kingstown was converted into an industrial zone and commercial district by the state of Rhode Island; a container port and the Quonset State Airport were also opened for commercial use.\nBy the 1980s, more than 12,000 cars were using Route 403 daily to access the business park; the Rhode Island Department of Transportation
