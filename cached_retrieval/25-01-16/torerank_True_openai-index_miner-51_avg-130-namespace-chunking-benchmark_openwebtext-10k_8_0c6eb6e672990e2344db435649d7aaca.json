from those with serious blood on their hands, will be retained is already envisaged in plans made by the NTC.\nThis avoids the error deemed so critical in Iraq, where disbanding the army left a security vacuum and fed an insurrection, but it will nevertheless not be easy.", "\u2022 The head of the rebel National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, said the NTC would move to Tripoli from Benghazi in the east when a new constitution has been drawn up.\nHe urged opposition supporters to stay within the law, to treat prisoners of war well and not take justice into their own hands,

aid over the coming weeks and said the new Libyan government would welcome the participation of many Libyans, not just those connected to the NTC and its base in Benghazi.\n\"Everything will be open to those who have not been tainted by blood,\" he said.", "\"It is symbolical and historical,\" he said.\n\"All the people in Libya insist it is the capital of the country.. because of its history and
