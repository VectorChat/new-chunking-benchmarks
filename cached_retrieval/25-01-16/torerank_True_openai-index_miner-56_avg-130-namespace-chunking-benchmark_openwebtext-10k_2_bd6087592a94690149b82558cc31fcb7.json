["The other is that it cannot cope with the necessity of origin for individual identity.\nLowe responds to the former objection by saying that essential properties are identical with the substance, so cannot be cited as something other than substance that meets his criterion for being substance.\nIt is not clear that this will work.\nThe idea that the essence is identical with the substance is Aristotelian, but it is not clear how this applies to essential properties, taken individually.\nWe have already seen, in our discussion of Aristotle, that the relation between the essence as some kind of unity and the properties that seem to constitute it is not clear.", "Lowe, in his (1998), which contains a very thorough discussion of all the topics discussed in this section, defends an \u2018independenceaccount of substance, which he states in terms of identity, as follows: x is a substance if and only if x is a particular and there is no particular y such that y is not identical to x and the identity of x depends on the identity of y.\nHe considers two objections to his own account which would seem to apply to all independence accounts.\nOne is that it cannot cope with essential properties, for it seems to imply that, for any given property-instance, a substance can exist without it, which is not true of essential properties.", "Would they, without such a substratum be just a stack of qualities, a house of cards with nothing holding them together?\nThere does not seem to be anywhere in the text where Locke discusses this problem\u2014that is, the coherence of atoms as opposed to composite objects\u2014explicitly.\nOne possible resort is to treat solidity as the core or master quality and all the others as features of it.", "Because he does not believe in void, extension carries with it the other basic properties of matter as features of it.\n2.5.2 Locke on \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substanceThe ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2014called sortals\u2014are formed by collecting such combinations of simple ideas, as are by experience and observation of men\u2019s senses, taken notice of to exist together, and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance.", "The properties [ideas] in terms of which sortals are defined do correspond to real qualities and powers in the world.\nThere is no sense in which these building blocks of reality are creatures of our conceptual scheme.\nThe properties invoked by nominal essences are \u201csupposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance\u201d(xxiii 3).", "Thus we come to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water, etc\u2026 (II xxiii 3) Thus, for Locke, the real essence is an unknown atomic constitution.\nThe types that we categorize them in depend on the properties we happen to be able to perceive and kinds or sorts are defined in terms of these observable properties.\nDefinition in these terms he calls \u2018nominal essence\u2019.\nOur concepts of natural substances presuppose that the nominal essence hides a real essence\u2014that is, that all water, gold, horses etc are in some way similar at a microscopic level.", "Sortals, unlike Aristotelian species, place no constraints on how individual objects must or ought to be.\nLocke\u2019s contribution is, therefore, three-fold.\nHe brings to centre stage the question of whether properties require some substratum or bare particular to inhere in or belong to.", "He copes with the second by denying that origin is essential to identity.\nUnfortunately, he argues for this position by citing human subjects: Socrates, for example, would still have been who he was even if he had had different parents.\nThis is, of course, controversial about humans, but it is our Cartesian intuitions that make it plausible in that case.", "In general, Locke\u2019s particular substances are not ontologically basic, because their essences are nominal, though this is not so clearly true for sortals naming biological kinds.\nLocke\u2019s conceptualism about such substances makes most of the tests irrelevant, which are cast within a realist framework.\nLocke\u2019s \u2018particular substancesare kinds which are individuated conventionally, and so are not real substantial kinds, by Aristotelian standards.\nBut Locke is not without substance other than substratum, for his real essence\u2014that is, the atoms and their structures\u2014are his real substances, and what we say above about the substantiality of atoms also goes for Locke.", "(II 23 v) This argument seems to conflate the notions of substratum as pure logical support with that as minute parts.\nIf he means minute parts, then, though it is true that we do not and, in his view, cannot know in detail what they are, we have a theory, which he endorses, that they are probably minute parts as conceived by the atomists, which means they have primary qualities similar in kind though not in scale to those possessed by macroscopic objects.", "The physical mass that houses both the sword and the walking stick can be identified independently of either.\nIf this were not the case it is difficult to see how one could even make the mistake of thinking of it as one thing.\nThe composites Siamese entities form are quite identifiable, and yet that entity is not supposed to fall under a sortal in its own right.", "This internal constitution \u201cmakes the whole subsist by itself\u201d (xxiii 6).\nThus Locke is entirely realist about individual bodies and their properties.\nHe is more conventionalist, however, about their classification under particular sortals.\nThere are four ways in which he is a conceptualist about particular substances, as we classify them.\nThere is nothing over and above the properties of an object corresponding to our substance concepts\u2014nothing, that is, like a substantial form\u2014present in the world.\nSortals are entirely formed by our minds, in the light of the properties perceived to be in the world.", "Substance, they say, is the only category of thing which might have only one instance through at least a minimally extended period of time.\nThus, for example, there is no possible world which has, in a given period of time, only one event, for any non-instantaneous event will be made of events which are its parts.\nSimilarly for properties or tropes, there can never be only one because any one entails the existence of others, as, for example, the existence of a red property (instance) entails the existence of (an instance of) the property colour.", "He asserts that the substantial nature of the physical world is the unknown structure of atomic parts, not a substantial form which reflects our usual concepts.\nThird, he develops a theory of substance which is realist about particular objects and their properties, but conceptualist or conventionalist about our classifications, within the constraints that the facts about particulars and properties impose.\nThere is one important context, however, where Locke does not appear to talk in a conventionalist way about sortal identity, but in a way that seems to be reminiscent of substantial forms.", "Michael Ayers (1975, 1991b: 39\u201350) believes that the only substratum that Locke acknowledges is the unknown\u2014and, Locke thinks, unknowable by us\u2014structure of the minute parts.\nThis is what he elsewhere characterizes as the real essence.\nIt is clear from the text that Locke is at least uneasy with the idea of \u2018pure substance in general\u2019, but it is less clear whether he feels obliged to accept an idea he dislikes, or whether he rejects it.\n(For the view that he accepts it, and why, see Bennett, 1971 and 1987.)\nThere are indications that Locke is confused about what he means by \u2018substratum\u2019.", "The boundaries we draw between kinds of things are, to some degree at least, arbitrary and concept relative.\nI do not deny, but nature, in the constant production of particular beings, makes them\u2026 very much alike and of kin one to another: but I think it nevertheless true, that the boundaries of the species, whereby men sort them, are made by men\u2026.\n(III vi 37: italics in original) The situation in (ii) is greatly aggravated by our ignorance of real essences.\nIf we could know those more accurately, we would know better where to draw the boundaries.\nThe disposition of properties in nature need not have been as it is and might actually contain oddities not corresponding to any of our sortals.", "It is natural to say that the statue is made of clay or even from a piece of clay.\nBut suppose one characterizes the clay more exactly, in terms of the particular atoms in a particular arrangement.\nStrictly, on modal grounds, this structured collection and the statue are different.\nThe statue could have been made of a collection of atoms with at least some different members, but the entity defined as containing just those atoms could not.\nThis entity\u2014atoms A 1 \u2026A n in given spatial arrangement S\u2014is not a very natural kind of object, but it is a real body, in a way that something arbitrarily composed of, for example, half of this table and two toes from President Bush\u2019s left foot is not.", "(II xxiii 2) The traditional rationale of Locke\u2019s doctrine of \u2018substance in generalis as follows.\nProperties\u2014or, in Locke\u2019s terms qualities\u2014must belong to something\u2014\u2018cannot subsist\u2026without something to support them\u2019.\nOf course, they belong to objects, but what are objects over and above their properties?\nThe special category of substantial form, as found in Aristotle, is rejected.\nAll that seems to be left is a bare \u2018something\u2019, which on pain of regress, has no properties in its own right, except the property of being the owner or support of other properties.\nThis interpretation of Locke\u2019s notion of \u2018substance in generalis, however, a matter of controversy.", "But he both denies that these real essences play any role in the formation of our concepts and is deeply sceptical of our ever being able to discover what they are.\nHis attitude towards the Aristotelian view is expressed later in the paragraph just quoted: \u2026a philosopher\u2026whatever substantial forms he may talk of, has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are found in them\u2026.\nLocke\u2019s doctrine of sortals is in some respects realist and in some conceptualist or conventionalist.", "He argues that the notion of spiritual substance is in no worse a predicament than material substance, because we have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of body: the one being supposed to be (without knowing what it is) the substratum to those simple ideas we have from without; and the other supposed (with a like ignorance of what it is) to be the substratum to those operations which we experiment in ourselves within.\n\u2018Tis plain then, that the idea of corporeal substance in matter, is as remote from our conceptions, and apprehensions, as that of spiritual substance, or spirit;\u2026.", "According to this usage, it is a live issue whether the fundamental entities are substances or something else, such as events, or properties located at space-times.\nThis conception of substance derives from the intuitive notion of individual thing or object, which contrast mainly with properties and events.\nThe issue is how we are to understand the notion of an object, and whether, in the light of the correct understanding, it remains a basic notion, or one that must be characterized in more fundamental terms.\nWhether, for example, an object can be thought of as nothing more than a bundle of properties, or a series of events.", "First, there is organization of the minute parts of particular kinds of objects, which is responsible for the manifest properties of those objects, and which he thinks will always fall beyond our knowledge.\nSecond is the mystery of what holds the minute parts together: the problem of explaining attraction in a system that only understands influence by impact.\n(xxiii 23).", "That being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in one coherent body, partaking of one common life, it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life, though that life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant\u2026.\n(Essay II.27.4) One might wonder what this \u2018common lifeis supposed to be, especially in the light of his rejection of Aristotelian \u2018substantial forms\u2019.\nFurthermore, it is tempting to argue that all coherent, solid bodies\u2014such as a lump of rock or plasticene\u2014have some principle of organization which persists through change.", "Thus, a particular instance of colour cannot exist, and could not have existed, without the object of which it is the colour, but the object can exist without the colour instance, for it may change colour and remain the same object, or it could have had a different colour from the start.", "It is a necessary condition for F\u2019s being an ultimate sortal that, whenever it applies to something, it applies in a present-tensed manner to the thing through the whole of its existence.\nThe statue and the lump of clay are dealt with by denying that the lump and the statue are identical: the lump of clay constitutes the statue, but is not identical with it.\nNotice that he could have argued that the statue was just a phase of the lump, but he does not do so because statue is not, by its very meaning, a phase sortal: statue, unlike child, does not indicate by its meaning a period in the existence of something.", "(iii) rests on the intuition that no collection of properties could, in themselves, amount to a substance: the very idea is a category mistake, and only the presence of a special \u2018substantializingelement could do that.\nIt might be argued that this intuition begs the question against the bundle theory.\nAt the current state of the debate, it looks as if there is no compelling reason for accepting substratum.\nThe Aristotelian tradition anchors the concept of substance, at least in nature, primarily to instances of species of natural object.\nThe Kantian tradition ties it to those enduring bodies the individuation of which gives sense and structure to our spatio-temporal framework.", "He either doubts that there are such things as substance or causation (scepticism) or even positively denies that there are (nihilism).\nOut of Hume\u2019s very forthright negative attitude there developed two more subtle variants.", "It is contested whether Locke actually believed in substance as a characterless substratum.\nAlthough the first quotation above seems to affirm it, Locke also in the same section speaks disparagingly about the idea, comparing it to the notion that the world rests on an elephant, which rests on a tortoise, and so on: in other words, as not constituting a real explanation at all.", "We have seen that Locke\u2019s particular substances are kinds of things, and because they are kinds they correspond to Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.\nBut we have also seen that the boundaries between these kinds are largely a matter of convention, which is not true of Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.\nIn so far as their individuation is dependent on human convention, they are not ultimately real in their own right.\nBut though they are not real as kinds, the individual parcels of matter that we classify in these ways are perfectly real.\nLocke does not, as far as I can see, refer to these individuals as \u2018substances\u2019.", "It is clear, however, that this is a serious oversimplification.\nFor a more nuanced and sophisticated view, see Lagerlund (2012), on which this section draws extensively.\nOur discussion of Aristotle ended by returning to the issue if the unity of substantial form \u2013 what is the difference between a collection of \u2018essentialproperties and the form as a unitary entity.\nVarious aspects of this issue of the unity of substantial form preoccupied medieval philosophers.\nAccording to Aquinas, a substance possessed only one form, and its matter was the essentially characterless prime matter.", "Whether anything could perform this role from amongst the properties that are basic to modern, post-Newtonian physics\u2014properties such as charm, energy, spin and mass\u2014is not easy to judge.\nOne objection often made against the theory is that bundles are mereological sums, rather like Locke\u2019s \u2018masses of matter\u2019, and that, therefore, any change of property is a change in the identity of the object.\nVarious forms of essentialist solutions to this problem have been suggested, for example, by Simons (1994), and Barker and Jago (2018).", "Third, is that idea of substance as a bare substratum, which is \u201ca supposed, I know not what, to support those ideas we call accidents.\u201d (xxiii 15).\nPerhaps it is more profitable to ask whether, in his own terms, Locke ought to have accepted bare substratum.\nIf we accept that the question of what binds together the qualities of a macroscopic object can be answered by appeal to the minute parts, the issue would then be what binds the primary qualities of atoms.\nDo the size, shape, mass, solidity of a particular atom require a bare substratum to inhere in for them to constitute a coherent object?", "If properties are conceived of as individuals\u2014otherwise known as tropes, property-instances or individualized forms\u2014then there cannot be a problem about the distinctness of exactly similar bundles, for the difference is built into the identity of the elements of the bundle, as it is not if the bundle is made of universals.\nThe problem for this version of the bundle theory seems to be that it is difficult to individuate or distinguish tropes in a way that makes them suitable to be individuals\u2014in one sense, the substances\u2014from which objects are made.", "The first is, however, once again intuitive but not compelling.\nIt appeals to the fundamental intuition that \u2018dogtells you what Fido is better than \u2018brown thingdoes, but does not really give a reason for this claim.\nOnly in Section 3.3, when we discuss Wiggins\u2019s theory, will we find more formal reasons for treating species or sortal concepts as more revealing of \u2018what something really isthan are other terms.", "He took Hume\u2019s \u2018tendencies of the mind to passfrom one idea to another, without which we could not construct the world, and canonized them as a priori categories of the understanding.\nHume\u2019s empiricist emphasis is psychological.\nIt concerns what we are habituated to do.\nBecause of his empiricism, he will not bring non-psychological necessity into it.\nNevertheless, there is the implication that making these transitions is the only way in which one can understand the world.\nKant drops the empirical psychology and makes it a matter of a priori psychology, that only by employing certain categories could we have experience as of a physical world.", "But it remains the case that, by dint of the meaning of the term, a baby is a phase of a human being (or, perhaps, some other animal) even when a particular creature fails to get beyond that phase.\nA sword is not, however, in virtue of the meaning of the word \u2018sword\u2019, a phase of anything, and to use the term to name a phase of something in a given case, when it suits, is ad hoc.\nAllowing sortals of this kind would put the concept of sortal under pressure, for an ultimate sortal was originally thought to be a kind of concept that necessarily characterizes an object present-tensedly throughout its existence, not a concept that sometimes does and sometimes does not.", "In particular, we shall look at the issue of whether objects must be individuated under the kind of sortal expressions that correspond to Aristotelian substance concepts, or whether a more generic notion, such as physical body, will suffice.\nThis latter concern will lead on to a consideration of the connection between substance and teleology.\nOne natural response to the question of what distinguishes substances from properties is that properties depend for their existence on substances, for they are properties of objects (that is, of individual substances), but that substances do not similarly depend on properties for their existence.", "Different properties might have been hung on this hook.\nIt is not so clear, by contrast, that a substratum of the kind Locke considers, or like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter, is a particular in this sense.\nIt is more like a kind of stuff\u2014the substantiveness on to which properties are stuck.\nOn this conception, the suggestion that the \u2018pieceof substratum or \u2018prime matterthat is here in object a, might always instead have been there in object b, seems to lack content.\nIt is useful at this point to take note of the three different functions the thin particular or substratum might fulfil.", "If a monad is at place p at time t, it will contain all the features of the universe at all times, but with those relating to its own time and place most vividly, and others fading out roughly in accordance with temporal and spatial distance.\nBecause there is a continuum of perspectives on reality, there is an infinite number of these substances.\nNevertheless, there is internal change in the monads, because the respect in which its content is vivid varies with time and with action.\nIndeed, the passage of time just is the change in which of the monad\u2019s contents are most vivid.", "Substances, considered as kinds, or instances of kinds, can sustain change\u2014living things, for example, change in size throughout their lives.\nMost individual parcels of matter, however, become different individuals if they change any of their parts; although we have seen that this does not apply to living things, where there seems to be a metaphysical component called sameness of life.", "The most obvious is that it does not, as stated, distinguish between substances and events.\nSome property-instances belong to events rather than substances.\nThe performance of a symphony, for example, is an event, and it may possess the property, in one of its movements, of being allegro.\nIt seems plausible that this particular case of something\u2019s being allegro could not have been exemplified by another performance, but the performance might go on to be andante in another movement, so the event can continue to exist without that original property.\nThe assimilation of events with substances in this way seems strained, however.", "This involves reinterpreting the rationale of our substance concepts.\nLocke thought that our concept of gold was properly expressed as \u2018anything gold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia\u2019.\nHe thought that we add the optimistic assumption that there will be similarity at the microscopic level.\nWhat many philosophers, under Putnam\u2019s influence, now think he should have said is that gold is that kind of thing which is individuated by a particular kind of minute structure that underlies the stuff which is gold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia.\nIn other words, our confidence that these kinds have a genuine real essence is built into the concept.", "On this he says two things.\n\u2018It is reasonable that, after the primary substances, their species and genera should be the only other things called (secondary) substance.\nFor only they, of things predicated, reveal the primary substance.(2 b28\u201330) \u2018Of the secondary substances the species is more a substance than the genus, since it is nearer to the primary substance.\nFor if one is to say of the primary substance what it is, it will be more apt to give the species than the genus.(2 b8\u201311) The second of these two points is more uncontroversial than the first, for it is indubitable that species terms focus more precisely on particular things than generic terms.", "This is when he is discussing the individuation of living things.\nHe understands ordinary bodies as mereological sums of atoms.\nAs such, any change of particle constitutes a new object, for a mereological sum is individuated by its parts and a change of parts means a change of the object constituted by those parts.\nTreating ordinary, non-living, bodies as complex enduring objects is a matter of convention determined by the concepts we happen to possess.\nLiving things, however, have a deeper principle of unity.", "Locke was pessimistic in two connected respects.\nFirst he was sceptical about the possibility of science discovering the nature of the real essences\u2014the structures of atoms or molecules\u2014that underlie kinds of substance picked out by our ordinary sortals.\nSecond, he doubted whether the objects picked out by our actual substance concepts really shared a real essence in the way we assume that they do.\nHe was not confident, that is, that everything we call gold, or iron, or a monkey, was actually interestingly similar at a non-superficial level.\nBoth these forms of pessimism proved largely unfounded.", "Whereas, for Aristotle, the properties that an object has to possess and those that it possesses throughout its existence coincide, they do not do so for Leibniz.\nThat is, for Leibniz, even the properties that an object possesses only for a part of its existence are essential to it.\nEvery monad bears each of its properties as part of its nature, so if it were to have been different in any respect, it would have been a different entity.", "This gives a coherent, though speculative, conception of material substance.\nOf spiritual substance, we have no similar hypothesis.\nIf, on the other hand, he means pure logical substratum, there is nothing to know, for there is no more to it, in either the material or spiritual case, than its role as substratum.\nHe seems to conflate the ignorance we have of minute parts with the logical emptiness of the idea of pure substratum.\nIn fact there are three issues concerning the material underpinning of things which Locke regards as mysterious, and he seems to move indifferently from one to the other.", "It does not seem natural to say that the same event was first allegro, then andante, because it is more natural to attribute the different properties to different parts of the event, which are themselves events (in this case, movements).", "So Wiggins deals with objections mainly by two distinctions.\nOne is between sortals which apply to objects through the whole of their existence, and sortals appropriate only to a phase of their existence: the other is between the \u2018isof identity and the \u2018isof constitution.\nCorrespondingly, criticism centres on whether the concepts under which we pick things out behave in as regimented a way as Wiggins requires, and on whether the \u2018isof constitution is sufficiently different from the \u2018isof identity to perform the task he wants of it.\n3.3.1 The discipline of sortal identification There are certain kinds of counter-example that Wiggins does not discuss in print.", "They agree that, even if the world is \u2018closed under physics\u2019\u2014every event has a complete set of physical causes\u2014the concepts of the other sciences are irreducible and do autonomous explanatory jobs.\nEven if dogs are wholly physical objects and even if all the atoms in dogs follow very precise laws of physics, nevertheless when doing the biology of dogs one will need concepts not to be found in a physics textbook.\nThis is not for mere shorthand convenience, but because of the kinds of things in which, for example, the biologist or veterinary scientist is interested.", "So our division of things into species, though grounded in real continuities in the way that our non-biological (or non-natural) concepts are not, is still nominal.\nAs we shall see, the idea that there is a real unity which is passed on through the life of an object or through any principle of organization is something that Hume criticizes and rejects.\nThe potential for a stronger realism in Locke has been exploited by Putnam and Kripke in their development of a modern, essentialist conception of natural kind terms.", "It implies only that something from the category of substance might so exist and that this could not be true of any other category.\nOne might wonder what enabled substances that could not exist alone to count as substances at all.\nIf either of the above accounts are successful, substances, properties and events are distinguished.", "One strategy is to take the notion of body or material object as basic.\nIn the next section, this possibility is compared with other options.\n3.3.3 A possible reconciliation of Wiggins and Ayers.", "It is natural to reply to this that an object is not an attribute of a place in the same way as a property is an attribute of a thing: the property is in a thing \u2018as a subject\u2019, but a place is not a subject to which a thing is attributed: the place does not \u2018underliethe thing as a thing \u2018underliesits properties.\nAlthough this may be true, it presupposes that we already have a grasp on the sense in which properties belong to objects and how this differs from the various ways that objects belong to or can be attributed to things, and that we can call upon this informal understanding in interpreting the theoretical account.\nWhether this is legitimate might depend on what the objective was.", "Being able to receive contraries.\n(4 a10) A substance can go from being hot to being cold, or from being red to being blue, but the instance of blue in an object cannot similarly take on and lose a wide range of attributes.\nIf substance did not exist it would be impossible for things in any of the other categories to exist.\nThere could be no instances of properties if there were no substances to possess them.\nBut these criteria do not show why \u2018dogis a secondary substance term and \u2018brown thingis not.\nSo we need marks for being a secondary substance, or substance concept.", "The main objections to the \u2018universalsform of the theory rest on its apparent commitment to the Identity of Indiscernibles, for if an object is no more than a bundle of properties, then if a and b have exactly the same properties, they are the same bundle.\nWhether it does carry this commitment may depend on whether one allows spatial points as particulars, in addition to the properties that are universal.\nIf one did, then the universal theories would not entail the identity of indiscernibles, for the same universals could be in two bundles by being at two different locations.", "Living objects are simply the most dramatic case of this.\n(Though Peter van Inwagen (1990) defends the view that only living things and atoms are real entities: inanimate complex bodies are not true individuals.)\nNevertheless, though the appeal to \u2018lifeseems to modify Locke\u2019s conventionalism, it still leaves open the possibility that the divisions we make between different species are conventions, because, though we can recognize life (or a \u2018continuing principle of organization\u2019) itself, it is still relatively arbitrary and concept-dependent where life (or \u2018principle of organization\u2019) of one kind ends and another starts.", "The world must possess such enduring objects for it to be intelligible for us\u2014indeed, for us to be part of it, for we are essentially stable bodies amongst other stable bodies.\nThe important point for both Strawson and Kant is that there must be substances for there to be a coherent empirical, spatio-temporal world.\nSubstance has become a formal concept of central importance\u2014that is a concept with a special central role in the structure of our conceptual scheme\u2014rather than being the name for certain kinds of important things in the world.", "These are the most typical kinds of counter examples and Wiggins has responses to both.\nHe deals with the first by invoking the concept of a phase sortal.\nA phase sortal is one that, by its meaning, denotes part of the life history of something, which, as a whole, is denoted by another sortal.\nSo child is a phase sortal which applies to a phase of the things fully designated by human being.\nThis illuminates an important aspect of the concept of a sortal.", "For footed and two-footed are said of man as subject, but are not in a subject; neither footed not two-footed is in man.\n(3 a23\u20135) It would seem that these properties belong to objects in different ways when they are part of a definition from when they are not.\nThe issue is what constitutes the unity of the species or secondary substance: why is it not just a collection of properties and, if it is just such a collection, why is it so different from any other collection of properties?", "This assumption makes it possible to state substance individuation using the language of identity.\nWithin the scope of this assumption, he makes two claims.\nThe first is the sortal relativity of identity: that is, when any a and b are asserted to be the same thing, they must be the same something-or-other, and the something-or-other must be the kind of concept that answers \u2018what is it?questions.\nIn other words, there is no such a thing as \u2018bare identity\u2019\u2014identity under no concept at all.\nFurthermore, the relevant concept must be an Aristotelian substance concept or sortal.", "An opponent of the deflationary view will say that properties, however understood, must be components of objects, conceptually or formally speaking.\nIf they are not the only components in this sense, one must say something about the nature of the rest.\nThe deflationist thinks that this line of thought embodies some kind of category mistake in the way it handles the idea of a component.\nThe anti-deflationist will argue that the fact that we are talking about components only in a conceptual sense does not alter the fact that we are obliged, once we start, to offer an account that is complete and distinguishes the various elements.", "First, it has the intuitive disadvantage that it allocates two solid physical objects to the same place.", "\u2018[Unified] bodycould always do the job of F, because other, more specific, terms work just because the things they designate are unified bodies.\nOn its own, \u2018same bodyis just not very explanatory.\nThe account given in these five points has the advantage that it is compatible with the fact that most identities involving reidentification are categorizable under sortals, but that there are other cases\u2014such as \u2018piece of\u2026\u2019, \u2018hunk of\u2026\u2019\u2014where this is not so.", "They are also the subjects of predication, so they meet criterion (iii).\nLeibniz\u2019s substances, however, are the bearers of change (criterion (iv)) in a very different way from Aristotle\u2019s individual substances.\nAn Aristotelian individual possesses some properties essentially and some accidentally.\nThe accidental properties of an object are ones that can be gained and lost over time, and which it might never have possessed at all: its essential properties are the only ones it had to possess and which it possesses throughout its existence.\nThe situation is different for Leibniz\u2019s monads\u2014which is the name he gives to individual substances, created or uncreated (so God is a monad).", "That this table, for example, could have been the same object even if made from different material does not have the same plausibility.\nWhether these objections to the above versions of the independence account can be answered is unclear.\nHoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994 and 1997) develop a different, though probably not incompatible, conception of the relative independence of substances compared to other categories.", "One natural thought is that we can reidentify middle-sized physical bodies that have fairly stable properties, irrespective of whether there is any interesting sortal term under which they fall.\nThis is not to say that they could be reidentified under the purely generic notions body or physical thing, if there were no continuity of manifest properties.\nThat this may be a powerful criticism of Wiggins\u2019s view can be seen by considering the notion of a Siamese object, which seemed to be necessary to answer the kind of problem posed by the swordstick.", "The point cannot be made quite so simply, however.\nProperties could not exist without objects to be properties of, but neither could substances exist without properties, so the dependence appears to be mutual.\nThis problem can be overcome by more careful expression of the point, making it clear that we are not talking about properties in general and substances in general, but about particular instances or cases of a property and the particular objects to which they belong.\nA particular property instance cannot exist and could not have existed without the substance of which it is a property, but the particular substance can exist and could have existed without that property instance.", "(v) and (vi) Kinds of individuals and stuffs.\nAlthough in everything, it is itself no kind of thing and therefore no kind of individual or stuff.\nSubstratum\u2019s claim to substancehood does not rest, however, on meeting the tests itself, but on being what enables particular kinds of substances to be substances.\nAccording to the believer in substratum, it is in virtue of their inhering in a substratum that a collection of properties can constitute an enduring, change-sustaining thing of a certain kind.\nWithout that support, individual instances of properties could, if they could exist at all, be no more than ephemeral events.", "We saw in the previous section that the differentia in terms of which a substance is defined is not treated as being \u2018inobjects, as other properties are.\nThis seems to suggest that calling an object a substance of a certain sort is not just a way of attributing to it the properties in terms of which it is defined.", "Each of them weighs, say, ten pounds, yet the total of their weight is only ten pounds.\nIt might seem natural to think\u2014and it was formerly a well established maxim\u2014that there can be only one solid physical thing at one place at a given time.\nSomeone impressed by the idea that two bodies cannot be in the same place at the same time might think it more natural to say that there are two different ways of conceptualizing the material presence at that point, than that there are two material things.\nThat way it is easy to see why two ten pound objects need not add up to twenty pounds when put together.", "Bennett offers one way out of the need to postulate a mysterious substratum.\nWhen I say \u2018This is an orangeI mean that there are here instances of certain properties such as orangeness, sphericality etc., and I indicate that I am operating on my ideas of those instances in a certain combining manner.\n(1987: 202.", "Let us agree, for purposes of argument, that human being is a kind of substance and that rationality and animality are the properties in terms of which that substance is defined.\nIt is uncontroversial that these properties are meant to be objective features of the external world.\nBut what is the relation between the substantial form and those properties?\nIs the presence of the substantial form human being nothing more than the presence of those properties, or is the form something further which is, in some sense responsible for the presence of those properties?", "All natural ultimate sortals designate unified physical bodies in the manner prescribed in (1), and so are very suitable as substitutions for F. It is logically possible, however, that this might not have been so (there might logically have been natural sortals that worked like swordstick), but that they do follow this model, and are not like swordstick, is a pretty deep fact about our world and about any world with similar laws of nature to those that hold in our world.", "(1978: 220) Hume\u2019s target is any account that postulates a unifying \u2018somethingthat underlies change, whether this be a characterless substratum, a substantial form or (though this is not explicitly mentioned) something like the \u2018continuing lifethat Locke sees as passed on in living things.\nThe crucial point is that a succession of very similar things does not constitute the real continuation of anything, only the illusion of real continuation.\nThus Hume\u2019s treatment of substance is like his treatment of causation, in that he sees both as the projection onto the world of a tendency of our minds either to pass from one thing to another or to associate them in some way.", "It also avoids the need to employ the \u2018\u201cis\u201d of constitutionto link sortals and particulars, like lumps and hunks, rather than just mass terms, such as \u2018clayor \u2018gold\u2019.\nThe case where the lump and the sortally individuated object do not coincide, applies only to some problematic artefactual cases, and in those cases the sortal name of the artefact will not be suitable substitute for F, but the \u2018lumpexpression will be.\nIn that way, it will be possible to avoid the need to have two material objects in the same place.", "Thus Fido the dog is a primary substance\u2014an individual\u2014but dog or doghood is the secondary substance or substantial kind.\nEach arm of this distinction raises different issues.\nIf one is concerned with kinds of substance, one obvious question that will arise is \u2018what makes something a thing of that kind (for example, what is involved in being a dog)?This is the question of the essence of substantial kinds.\nBut if one is concerned with individuals, the parallel question is \u2018what makes something that particular individual of a given kind (for example, what is involved in a dog\u2019s being and remaining Fido)?This is the question of individual essences and of identity over time.", "It is a strong claim for it purports to prove that any world with individuable objects must be constituted by Aristotelian substances.\nThe argument is powerful because it follows by simple logic, granted seemingly plausible claims about identity, and Leibniz\u2019s Law.\nOn the other hand, there seem to be many cases of objects which can be identified under a variety of concepts, leading to different life histories.", "Furthermore, there is a sense in which all monads are exactly similar to each other, for they all reflect the whole world.\nThey each do so, however, from a different perspective.\nFor God, so to speak, turns on all sides and considers in all ways the general system of phenomena which he has found it good to produce\u2026And he considers all the faces of the world in all possible ways\u2026the result of each view of the universe, as looked at from a certain position, is\u2026a substance which expresses the universe in conformity with that view.\n(1998: 66) So each monad reflects the whole system, but with its own perspective emphasised.", "This is termed relativity of identity.\nFor example, a and b may be the same person but not the same child because b is a grown up and no longer a child.\nOr a and b may be the same lump of clay but not the same statue because b is the lump after it has been reshaped out of its statue shape.", "This brings out a major difference between substances and events, namely that the temporal parts of events are themselves events in their own right, but the temporal parts of objects\u2014meaning by that expression the temporal phases of an object\u2019s existence\u2014are not themselves objects.\nIndeed, it is not natural to talk of the temporal parts of objects, though some philosophers (led by David Lewis (1986), but see also Sider (2001), Hawley (2001) and the entry on temporal parts) think that there are compelling philosophical reasons for doing so.\nThe rationale implicit in our ordinary concept is that an object is wholly present at all the temporal points of its existence.", "By the expression \u2018ad hoc phase sortalI mean a sortal that can be used sometimes as a phase sortal, designating an object only through part of its existence, and sometimes as an ultimate sortal, designating an object through the whole of its existence.\nOf course, even normal phase sortal might, contingently, in a given instance, designate an object through the whole of its existence.\nOne might say that the phase sortal baby could designate something through the whole of its existence if, for example, a human being died at the age of six months and hence never got beyond babyhood.", "Second, generation and decay depend on the material component in composites.\nAny form that does not require matter for its activity will be eternal by nature.", "It embodies the principle that if anything is both an F and a G, where F and G are normally ordinary sortals, then it is really an F/G and ceases to exist if it loses either its F or its G features and is replaced by something that is either just an F or just a G/ One possible way out of this kind of case is to say that the sword is a phase of the walking stick, thereby introducing ad hoc phase sortals.", "In other words the informed parts of an object \u2013 in the case of a living creature, its organs, and the various kinds of stuff that constituted it (in the end, quantities of earth fire air and water) did not possess their own forms, but were informed by the overall substantial form.", "Individual substances are more durable than instances of the properties in the other categories, for it is substances that can take on and lose those other properties.\nIndividuals are not, however, very long-lived and on this criterion Aristotle makes what could be regarded as a concession to Plato, for it is form as universal, which Aristotle does not consider properly substance, which is most durable.\nThere are at least two senses in which substantial forms are eternal.\nFirst, Aristotle believes the world to be eternal and all the same species to exist eternally.\nSo that, even though particular objects are subject to degeneration and decay, the species as such are eternal.", "First the compatibilist one.\nEmpiricist philosophers of science used to believe that the concepts in higher order sciences could be reduced, either by means of reductive definition or by \u2018bridging laws\u2019, to those in the more basic sciences.\n(See, for example, Nagel 1961.)\nBy such means, everything could be understood in terms of the most basic science\u2014presumed to be physics.\nConcepts in the other sciences are thus only a kind of shorthand for laborious descriptions in the language of physics.\nFew, if any, philosophers of science believe this now.", "I say \u2018implicit rationale\u2019, because it seems no more natural to speak of an object as being \u2018wholly present at all temporal points of its existencethan it is to say that it has objects as its temporal parts.\nNevertheless, one does not think of a long-lived object as consisting of a series of short-lived objects stacked end to end, but one does think it natural to think of a drawn-out event as consisting of a series of shorter events.\nIf it is not natural to think of objects as having objects as their temporal parts, this seems to commit one to thinking of objects as wholly present at all times of their existence, strange though this form of expression may also be.", "Buridan, who represents a further development in this direction, says In this sense, I am not the same as I was yesterday, because something was part of my integrity yesterday, which has already been used up, and something was not part of my integrity, which has meanwhile been added by nourishment.\n(Buridan, Physics I,q.10, f. xiii: cited Lagerlund, 476) It is clear that this way of thinking paves the way for atomism and its associated problems as they emerged in early modern philosophy.\nThe concept of substance figures centrally in a positive way for the rationalist philosophers, in a way that it does not for the empiricists.", "It is only by understanding the world as possessing enduring spatio-temporal objects, which enter into causal relations with each other (that is, it is only by applying the categories of substance and causation) that we can have intelligible experience.\nSubstances\u2014that is, a framework of stable, enduring objects\u2014are essential, but the source of this necessity lies not how the world is in itself, but in the framework which we are obliged to impose.\nIn the Kantian philosophy of P. F. Strawson (1959, 1966), this framework of necessity is taken in a more common-sense and realist spirit.", "This can be expressed as: The substances in a given system are those entities crucial from the teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucialmeans that other things exist either to constitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.\nDifferent philosophers emphasize different criteria from amongst this list, for reasons connected with their system as a whole.", "One we have already noticed, namely (i) whether such forms are universals or particulars.\nThe others are (ii) what is the relationship between the substantial form and the properties which enter into its definition?\nWe have already noticed this question when discussing Categories.\n(iii) What is the ontological status of such forms?\nThis is connected with the second question, for it is connected with the question of what the substantial form is over and above the properties essential to it.\nWhat I mean by this is as follows.", "One way out of this problem may be to resort to the notion of a master property which was invoked in the discussion of Locke on substratum (2.5.1); that is, to the notion of one property of which all the others are modes, as visual shape is a mode of colour, or extension is the master property of matter for Descartes.\nIn the Newtonian model, solidity might fill this role, for shape is merely the outline of the solidity which constitutes the heart of the object.\nIn a sense, theories of this kind are not ordinary bundle theories, for one property is chosen to fill the role of substratum, because the other properties inhere in, or are modes of, it.", "When we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the smooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the succession\u2026When we compare its situation after a considerable change the progress of the thought is broken; and consequently we are presented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which contradictions, the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and invisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these variations; and this unintelligible something it calls a substance, or original and first matter.", "The ontological status of complex bodies and \u2018masses of matter(in Locke\u2019s phrase) is an issue very much under dispute and we shall return to it below.\n3.3.2 The \u2018isof constitution A statue and a lump of clay occupy the same place at a given time.\nWhat is their relation to each other?\nThe apparent options are (i) they are identical (ii) they are not identical, but the clay constitutes the statue.\n(i) appears to be ruled out because they have different identity conditions.\n(ii) has seemed to many philosophers to be the natural solution to the problem, but it, too, faces difficulties.", "This introduces a category of what one might call Siamese objects.\nIt can be argued, however, that allowing this kind of entity undermines Wiggins\u2019s opposition to those, like Ayers, who think that the concept for reidentifying objects is, or often is, something more generic than sortal concepts; something akin to material body.\nTo see how this may come about, we must consider the rationale for Ayers\u2019s theory.\nThe fact that sortals do not seem to follow the discipline that Wiggins wishes for them might be taken to support the view that substances can be individuated under much more generic notions, such as same body or same material thing.\n(Ayers 1991a).", "In logic and in the application of Leibniz\u2019s Law, \u2018a is Fis normally equivalent to \u2018a was, is or will be F\u2019, otherwise the Law would not apply to such accidental properties as \u2018is brown\u2019.\nThis is also the way phase sortals work: a human being is, was, or will be a baby.\nThe argument against relative identity works by arguing that, if one allowed relative identity, a contradiction would follow, namely that one would get a situation in which a is G, a = b and b is not G. For this to be a contradiction, \u2018is Gmust be univocal in both cases as either \u2018\u2014was, is or will be Gor \u2018\u2014is at all times G\u2019.", "And substances are distinguished from events in the following way: events are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are temporally composed of further things of the same category (i.e., events): substances are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are not temporally composed of things of the same category (i.e., of substances) but endure singly through the period.", "This question can be given a deflationary or a substantive answer.\nThe deflationary answer is that a substance is a thing which has properties, and that is all one needs to say.\n(See, for example, Crane and Farkas 2004, 143f, and Chisholm 1969.)\nAn object is not composed of properties and some further ingredient\u2014the \u2018thingybit\u2014an object is something which simply has properties.\nAny feature of it can, of course, be regarded as a property, but that does not render an object nothing but a collection of properties.\nThere seems to be a clash of intuitions at this point about what makes sense.", "The division between being said of and being in\u2014that is, between substance concepts and other properties\u2014seems intuitively clear enough until one remembers that substance concepts are complex and are definable in terms of other properties.\nThus, \u2018manis defined as \u2018featherless bipedor \u2018rational animal\u2019, and it would seem that \u2018featherless\u2019, \u2018two-footedor \u2018rationalare properties and hence the kinds of things that are in objects.\nAristotle denies that this is so when they enter into the definition of a substance.\nThe features that specifically make an object the kind of substance that it is, are called differentiae, and Aristotle says the differentia also is not in a subject."]
