Soviet Union being portrayed as essentially justified.\n[184] This was even more the case as Nolte insisted that Operation Barbarossa was as Hitler claimed a \"preventive war\", which meant that for Nolte, Wehrmacht war crimes were portrayed as a defensive response to the threat posed to Germany by the \"Asiatic hordes\".\n[184] This was even more the case as Nolte insisted that Operation Barbarossa was as Hitler claimed a \"preventive war\", which meant that for Nolte, Wehrmacht war crimes were portrayed as a defensive response to the threat posed to Germany by the \"Asiatic hordes\".\nAndreas Hillgruber's call for historians to \"identity\" and \"empathize\" with German troops fighting on the Eastern Front in 1944\u201345 implicitly devalued the lives of those suffering and dying in the Holocaust, which was allowed to continue in part because the German troops held out for so long.\n[184]", "In their memoirs, German Army generals claimed that the war had been a \"clean war\" on their part with the Army fighting because of the noble Prussian-German traditions, patriotism and a deep sense of honour and duty and that National Socialism had virtually no influence on the Army.\n[176] In this version, almost all German war crimes were the work of the SS and any \"excesses\" committed by the Army were only the product of a long and bitter war and were no different from Allied war crimes.\n[176] Very typical were the claims of one Infantry commander, who stated in his memoirs that all of the battles fought by his men were \"always fairly conducted, though tough and bitter.\n\"[177] Such claims were widely believed not only in Germany but abroad, with the British military historian Captain Basil Liddell Hart writing that \"the German Army in the field on the whole observed the rules of war better than in 1914\u201318\".\n[178] On 11 December 1979, the West German television show Report aired a documentary entitled \"Crimes of the Wehrmacht in World War Two\".\n[172] The public's reaction was almost overwhelmingly negative, with World War II veterans leading a campaign to have the producer of Report fired for the \"defamation\" of German soldiers.\nThis despite the fact \u2013 as the German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster was to write in 1989 \u2013 that the producers of the documentary had gone out of their way to be fair and unbiased.\n[172]", "Michael St\u00fcrmer's geographical interpretation of German history meant that Germany's \"mission\" in Central Europe was to serve as a bulwark against the Slavic menace from the East in both World Wars.\n[184]", "Anyone who has ever looked into the face of a Red commissar knows what the Bolsheviks are.\nThere is no need here for theoretical reflections.\nIt would be an insult to animals if one were to call the features of these, largely Jewish, tormentors of people beasts.\nThey are the embodiment of the infernal, of the personified insane hatred of everything that is noble in humanity.\nIn the shape of these commissars we witness the revolt of the subhuman against noble blood.\nThe masses whom they are driving to their deaths with every means of icy terror and lunatic incitement would have brought about an end of all meaningful life, had the incursion not been prevented at the last moment;\" [the last statement is a reference to the \"preventive war\" that Barbarossa was alleged to be].\n[26]", "In 1989, the British historian Richard J. Evans wrote that right from the beginning of the war against the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht fought a genocidal war of \"extreme brutality and barbarism\".\n[181] Evans noted that the Wehrmacht officers regarded the Russians as \"sub-human\", were from the time of the invasion of Poland in 1939 telling their troops that war was caused by \"Jewish vermin\", and explained to the troops that the war against the Soviet Union was a war to wipe out what were variously called \"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans\", the \"Mongol hordes\", the \"Asiatic flood\" and the \"red beast\".\n[182]", "Rapes [ edit ] Rapes were allowed in practice by the German military (officially forbidden, however) in eastern and southeastern Europe, while northern and western countries were relatively spared.\n[78][79] In Occupied Denmark, which initially agreed to collaborate with Nazi Germany, rapes were not widespread, and German officials promised to punish them.\n[78] By contrast thousands of Soviet female nurses, doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured, and were often murdered afterwards.\n[18] German soldiers used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women \u2013 and other women as well \u2013 with the words \"Whore for Hitler's troops\" and rape them.\n[80] Following their capture some German soldiers vividly bragged about committing rape and rape-homicide.\n[81] Susan Brownmiller argues that rape played a pivotal role in Nazi aim to conquer and destroy people they considered inferior, such as Jews, Russians, and Poles.\n[82] An extensive list of rapes committed by German soldiers was compiled in the so called \"Molotov Note\" in 1942.\nBrownmiller points out that Nazis used rape as a weapon of terror.\n[83] Examples of mass rapes in Soviet Union committed by German soldiers include:", "The last of the 08/15 films ends with Germany being occupied by a gang of American soldiers portrayed as bubble-gum chewing, slack-jawed morons and uncultured louts, totally inferior in every respect to the heroic German soldiers.\n[188] The only exception is the black-marketing Jewish American officer, who is shown as both hyper-intelligent and unscrupulous, which Bartov noted seems to imply that the real tragedy of World War II was the Nazis did not get a chance to exterminate all of the Jews, who have now returned with Germany's defeat to once more exploit the German people.\n[188] This is especially the case because the Jewish officer speaks his German with an upper-class accent, which is evidently meant to suggest he is a rich German Jew who fled to the United States in the 1930s and upon his return after 1945 is engaging in the same sort of black-market activities that had led the Nazis to run people like him out of Germany in the first place.\n[188]", "The Nuremberg trials did not prosecute anyone for rape or other sexual violence; rape was defined as a crime against humanity, but prosecutors deemed that such crimes had \"no nexus to war\".\n[86]", "One SS man who saw the killings at Byelaya Tserkov described them as follows: I went to the woods alone.\nThe Wehrmacht had already dug a grave.\nThe children were brought along in a tractor.\nI had nothing to do with this technical procedure.\nThe Ukrainians were standing around trembling.\nThe children were taken down from the tractor.\nThey were lined up along the top of the grave and shot so that they fell into it.\nThe Ukrainians did not aim at any particular part of the body.\nThey fell into the grave.\nThe wailing was indescribable.\nI shall never forget the scene throughout my life.\nI find it very hard to bear.\nI particularly remember a small fair-haired girl who took me by the hand.\nShe too was shot later..\nThe grave was near some woods.\nIt was not near the rifle-range.\nThe execution must had taken place in the afternoon at about 3.30 or 4.00.\nIt took place the day after the discussions at the Feldkommandanten...Many children were hit four or five times before they died.\n[69]", "According to the Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, it was typical for camps devoted to armaments production to be run by the branch of the Wehrmacht that used the products.\nDozens of camps and subcamps were staffed primarily by the Luftwaffe alone.\n[a] In 1944, many Wehrmacht soldiers were transferred to the SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde to alleviate personnel shortages in concentration camps.", "Widespread plunder and theft [ edit ] Throughout the campaign Wehrmacht engaged in widespread theft and plunder of Polish citizens' property.\n[54] Until 3 November 1939 the Wehrmacht sent to the Nazi Germany 10,000 train wagons with stolen property including agricultural machinery, furniture and food.\n[55][56]", "The historians responsible for the exhibition assume that the anti-Semitic climate and propaganda in Nazi Germany had an immense impact on the entire population and emphasize the importance of the indoctrination.\n[205]", "The killing of POWs by Wehrmacht soldiers started during the September 1939 Poland campaign.\nIn many cases large groups of Polish soldiers were murdered after capture.\nHitler's Commando Order, issued in 1942, provided \"justification\" for the shooting of enemy commandos, whether uniformed or not.\n[citation needed] The massacres include that of at least 1500 black French POWs of West African origin and was preceded by propaganda depicting the Africans as savages.\n[105] From October 1942 onwards, the Wehrmacht carried out the 'Commando Order' calling for the summary execution of all captured commandos, even if in uniform.\nAfter the Italian armistice in 1943, many POWs were executed on several occasions when Italian troops resisted their forcible disarmament by the Germans.\nThe massacre of the Acqui Division at Kefalonia is the most infamous.\nOn 26 March 1944, 15 uniformed US Army officers and men were shot without trial at La Spezia, in Italy, after orders of the commander of the German 75th Army Corps, General Anton Dostler, despite the opposition of his subordinates of the 135th Fortress Brigade.\nDostler was sentenced to death by an American military tribunal and executed by firing squad in December 1945.\n[106][107]", "In Soviet Russia rapes were only a concern if they undermined military discipline.\n[89] Since 1941, rape was theoretically punishable with the death sentence, although rapes were rarely prosecuted in practice and rapes by Germans of non-German women were not taken seriously, nor was it punishable by death, especially in the eastern European territories.\n[86]:288 In October 1940 the laws on rape were changed, making it a \"petitioned crime\" \u2013 that is a crime for which punishment had to be requested.\nHistorian Christa Paul writes that this resulted in \"a nearly complete absence of prosecution and punishment for rape\".\n[86]:288 There were rape cases in the east where the perpetrators were sentenced if the rape was highly visible, damaging to the image of the German Army and the courts were willing to pass a condemning verdict against the accused.\n[86]:289 According to the historian Regina M\u00fchlh\u00e4user, the Wehrmacht also used sexual violence and undressing in numerous cases of interrogations.\n[95] M\u00fchlh\u00e4user adds that the number of illegitimate children born in the occupied regions did not exceed the prewar time.\nShe comes to the conclusion that rapes on the Eastern front were not singular cases but has to admit that the state of source material is very poor.\n[96]", "The Wehrmacht also worked very closely with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering members of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union.\nOn October 10, 1941 General Walther von Reichenau drafted an order to be read to the troops under his command stating that: \"the soldier must achieve full understanding of the necessity for a harsh but just vengeance against Jewish subhumanity.\n\"[75] Upon hearing of Reichenau's Severity Order, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group South announced his \"complete agreement\" with it, and sent out a circular to all of the Army generals under his command urging them to send out their own versions of the Severity Order, which would impress upon the troops the need to exterminate Jews.\n[76] Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942", "The German people is deeply indebted to the Fuehrer, because if these animals, our enemies here, had reached Germany, murders of a nature not yet witnessed in the world would have occurred.. No newspaper can describe what we have seen.\nIt verges on the unbelievable, and even the Middle Ages do not compare with what has transpired here.\nReading Der Stuermer and observing its photos give only a limited impression of what we have seen here and of the crimes committed here by the Jews.\nJudith Levin and Daniel Uziel state that this type of writing and opinion was very common in correspondence left by German soldiers, especially on the Eastern Front.\n[205] Other samples of German soldiers' letters were sent home and copied during the war by a special Polish Home Army cell that infiltrated the German postal system.\n[206] These letters have been analyzed by historians and the picture they paint is similar to views expressed by Levin and Uziel.\nMany soldiers wrote openly about the extermination of Jews and were proud of it.\nSupport for \"untermensch\" and \"master race\" concepts were also part of the attitude expressed by German soldiers.\n[206] Presented examples reflecting this trend include samples such as:", "Although this material was not used at the time, later in 1941 the material the psychological war laboratory had developed in 1935 was dusted off, and served as the basis not only for propaganda in the Soviet Union but also for propaganda within the German Army.\n[26] Before Barbarossa, German troops were exposed to violent anti-Semitic and anti-Slavic indoctrination via movies, radio, lectures, books and leaflets.\n[27] The lectures were delivered by \"National Socialist Leadership Officers\", who were created for that purpose, and by their junior officers.\n[27] German Army propaganda portrayed the Soviet enemy in the most dehumanized terms, depicting the Red Army as a force of Slavic Untermenschen (sub-humans) and \"Asiatic\" savages engaging in \"barbaric Asiatic fighting methods\" commanded by evil Jewish commissars to whom German troops were to grant no mercy.\n[28] Typical of the German Army propaganda was the following passage from a pamphlet issued in June 1941:", "In the summer of 1940, Reinhard Heydrich, the chief of the Reich Main Security Office (including the Gestapo), noted that: \"...compared to the crimes, robberies and excesses committed by the army [part of the Wehrmacht], the SS and the police don't look all that bad\".\n[42] Even when the German Army was not involved in war crimes, all of the top military leaders were aware of what was happening in Poland.\nNone objected on moral principles; the few who did object did so due to concerns about discipline.\n[38] Moreover, the general who objected the loudest to war crimes in Poland, General Johannes von Blaskowitz, was opposed to the Army committing war crimes with the SS, not the idea of atrocities against Poland.\n[43] The Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that Blaskowitiz was actually \"legitimizing murder\" by expressing approval of SS massacres while demanding that the Army be kept out of the massacres as damaging to discipline.\nBartov wrote that once officers and troops saw that murder was \"legitimate\" in Poland, the effect was that the Army tended to copy the SS.\n[44]", "Only with Jenseits des Krieges (released in the US as East of War) in 1996, a documentary directed by Ruth Beckermann dealing with the public's reaction to the exhibition \"War of Extermination\" in Vienna in 1995, did a German film admit to Wehrmacht war crimes being commonplace instead of an exception to the rule.\n[199] Some veterans in Jenseits des Krieges denied that the German Army committed any war crimes at all while others express relief at long last that the truth has been told.\n[200] One critic wrote of the veterans in Jenseits des Krieges that \"Some are sorry for their brutality, while others rationalize such acts as shooting POWs, raping women and butchering Jewish people as part of what soldiers were expected to do\".\n[201]", "Bartov wrote that all three historians had in varying ways sought to justify and excuse Wehrmacht war crimes by depicting the Wehrmacht as engaging in a heroic battle for Western civilization, often using the same language as the Nazis such as referring to the Red Army as the \"Asiatic hordes\".\n[184] Bartov ended that these sorts of arguments reflected a broader unwillingness of the part of some Germans to admit to what their Army did during the war.\n[184] In 1998, J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster, a German historian, wrote that for too long most people have accepted at face value the self-serving claims made by generals like Erich von Manstein and Siegfried Westphal who promoted the idea of the Wehrmacht in their memoirs as a highly professional, apolitical force who were victims of Adolf Hitler rather than his followers.\n[185] F\u00f6rster argues the Wehrmacht played a key role in the Holocaust in Eastern Europe and other war crimes.\n[186] In 1999, New Zealand historian Christian Leitz wrote that the claims promoted after the war that the Wehrmacht had been an \"untarnished shield\" with the Army somehow standing apart from the regime it served so loyally was a \"myth\" that no serious historian had taken seriously since the 1980s.\n[174][175]", "Barbarossa Decree [ edit ] The background behind the Barbarossa Decree was laid out by Hitler during a high level meeting with military officials on 30 March 1941,[18] where he declared that war against Soviet Russia would be a war of extermination, in which both the political and intellectual elites of Russia would be eradicated by German forces, in order to ensure a long-lasting German victory.\nHitler underlined that executions would not be a matter for military courts, but for the organised action of the military.\n[18] The decree, issued by Field Marshal Keitel a few weeks before Operation Barbarossa, exempted punishable offenses committed by enemy civilians (in Russia) from the jurisdiction of military justice.\nSuspects were to be brought before an officer who would decide if they were to be shot.\nProsecution of offenses against civilians by members of the Wehrmacht was decreed to be \"not required\" unless necessary for the maintenance of discipline.\n[citation needed]", "(he was not a member of the SS).\nHe performed experiments on the limbs of middle-aged and young prisoners;

both German states needed to establish armed forces and could not do so without trained officers and soldiers that had served in the Wehrmacht.\nGerman historiography in the 1950s viewed war crimes by German soldiers as exceptional rather than ordinary; soldiers were seen as victims of the Nazi regime.\nTraces of this attitude can still be seen in some German works today, which minimize the number of soldiers who took part in Nazi crimes.\n[171] This was especially the case as the German public in the immediate post-war period were more interested in seeing themselves rather than others as victims.\n[172] Thus the subject of Red Army atrocities against German civilians in 1944\u201345 received vastly more popular and historical interest in the 1950s than did the subject of Wehrmacht atrocities against Soviet civilians in 1941\u201344.\n[172]", "One criticism was that both exhibitions only covered the German presence in the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1945 and excluded the German occupation of Poland after September 1939.\nThe Polish exhibition \"Gr\u00f6\u00dfte H\u00e4rte..
