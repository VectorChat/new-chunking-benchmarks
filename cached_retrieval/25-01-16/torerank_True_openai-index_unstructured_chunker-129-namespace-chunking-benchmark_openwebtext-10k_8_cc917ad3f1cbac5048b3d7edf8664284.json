["Chris Stephen writes from Misrata to say he can foresee the rebels falling out amongst themselves over whether to hand Muammar Gaddafi to the international criminal court, or give him an \"off with his head\" type of trial in Libya.\nChris says he feels the key to the rebels' rapid success over the last few days was Nato.\nGaddafi could not replace the kit being blown up every day by Nato raids, but instead of shortening his lines, he kept them in place.\nThe rebels played a subsidiary role, says Chris: their own poorly planned attacks helped with attrition and the other key role was that by forcing Gaddafi to defend the front lines they made Gaddafi concentrate his tanks and guns on the frontlines, giving Nato handy targets.\nChris says the rebel National Transitional Council has a problem with legitimacy.\nIt took power in a revolution, but if it does anything certain tribes or sections of the population do not like, the result will be protests claiming they are dictators.\nIt will be interesting, Chris says, to see in the coming weeks whether the NTC brings forces from outside Tripoli in to control the capital.\nChris also says he has heard that Nato suspects the Gaddafi

regime collapses, there's still fierce fighting in some areas, and we have reports of regime elements threatening to continue fighting.\nAlthough it's clear that Gaddafi's rule is over, he still has

perhaps the case can be made that no-fly zones have proven their effectiveness.\nNato went further than that, though, and that troubles me \u2014 because that's not what the citizens of Nato countries were told would happen, and it's not what the UN sanctioned.\nThe usual blowhard neocon commentators are now using this not only to defend the idea of humanitarian interventionism, but to bash
