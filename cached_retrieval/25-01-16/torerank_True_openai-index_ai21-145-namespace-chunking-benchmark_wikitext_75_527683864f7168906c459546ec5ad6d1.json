["Public executions were normally attended by large crowds.\nFor the killing in 1546 of Anne Askew, charged with heresy and tortured at the Tower of London, a \"Substancyall Stage\" was built to seat the various officials who presided over her burning.\nA witness to proceedings reported that Askew was so badly injured by her torture that she was unable to stand.\nInstead, \"the dounge carte was holden up betwene ij sarjantes, perhaptes syttyng there in a cheare\".\nA pamphlet detailing the burning in April 1652 of Joan Peterson, the so-called Witch of Wapping, also describes the execution of Prudence Lee, found guilty of mariticide.", "About 30 minutes later, faggots were placed around the stake, her body was chained into position, and subsequently burned for over two hours.\nExecutions like this had once passed with little to no comment in the press.\nHistorically, while fewer women than men were subjected to capital punishment, proportionately more were acquitted, found guilty of lesser charges, or pardoned if condemned.\nIn centuries past, these women were judged by publications such as The Newgate Calendar to have succumbed to their own perversions, or to have been led astray.", "Lee was apparently brought on foot, between two sheriff's officers and dressed in a red waistcoat, to the place of execution in Smithfield.\nThere she confessed to having \"been a very lewd liver, and much given to cursing and swearing, for which the Lord being offended with her, had suffered her to be brought to that untimely end\".\nShe admitted to being jealous of and arguing with her husband, and stabbing him with a knife.\nThe executioner put her in a pitch barrel, tied her to the stake, placed the fuel and faggots around her and set them alight.\nLee was reported to have \"desired all that were present to pray for her\" and, feeling the flames, \"shrike[d] out terribly some five or six several times.\"", "The Times incorrectly stated that Sullivan was burned alive, rhetoric which, in Dr Simon Devereaux's opinion, could be \"rooted in the growing reverence for domesticated womanhood\" that might have been expected at the time.\nAs many objections may also have been raised by the perceived iniquity of drawing and burning women for coining, whereas until 1783, when the halting of executions at Tyburn removed ritualistic dragging from public view, men were simply drawn and hanged.\nA widening gulf between the numbers of men and women whipped in London (during the 1790s, 393 men versus 47 women), which mirrors a similar decline in the sending of women to the pillory, may also indicate an imposition of commonly-held gender ideals on English penal practices.", "Another law enforceable by public burning was De heretico comburendo, introduced in 1401 during the reign of Henry IV.\nIt allowed for the execution of persons of both sexes found guilty of heresy, thought to be \"sacrilegious and dangerous to souls, but also seditious and treasonable.\"\nBishops were empowered to arrest and imprison anyone suspected of offences related to heresy and, once convicted, send them to be burned \"in the presence of the people in a lofty place\".\nAlthough the act was repealed in 1533/34, it was revived over 20 years later at the request of Queen Mary I who, during the Marian persecutions, made frequent use of the punishment it allowed.", "Fly agaric shamanism is also explored in the 2003 novel Thursbitch by Alan Garner.\n= Burning of women in England = In England, burning was a legal punishment inflicted on women found guilty of high treason, petty treason and heresy.\nOver a period of several centuries, female convicts were publicly burnt at the stake, sometimes alive, for a range of activities including coining and mariticide.\nWhile men guilty of heresy were also burned at the stake, those who committed high treason were instead hanged, drawn and quartered.", "Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as \"the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies\".\nHowever, an observation by historian Jules Michelet, that \"the first flame to rise consumed the clothes, revealing poor trembling nakedness\", may, in the opinion of historian Vic Gatrell, suggest that this solution is \"misconceived\".\nIn The Hanging Tree, Gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in Europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling, kicking female hanging from a noose could \"elicit obscene fantasies\" from watching males.", "The English jurist William Blackstone supposed that the difference in sentencing, although \" full as terrible to the sensation as the other \", could be explained by the desire not to publicly expose a woman's body.\nPublic executions were well @-@ attended affairs, and contemporary reports detail the cries of women on the pyre as they were burned alive.\nIt later became commonplace for the executioner to strangle the convict, and for the body to be burned post @-@ mortem.\nIn the latter half of the eighteenth century, changing attitudes to such public displays prompted Sir Benjamin Hammett MP to denounce the practice in Parliament.", "Burning alive for murder was abolished in 1656, although burning for adultery remained.\nThereafter, out of mercy, the condemned were often strangled before the flames took hold.\nNotable exceptions to this practice were the burnings in 1685 and 1726 of Elizabeth Gaunt, found guilty of high treason for her part in the Rye House Plot, and Catherine Hayes, for petty treason.\nHayes apparently \"rent the air with her cries and lamentations\" when the fire was lit too early, preventing the executioner from strangling her in time.\nShe became the last woman in England to be burned alive.", "The burning in 1789 of Christian Murphy, for coining, received practically no attention from the newspapers (perhaps owing to practical limitations on how much news they could publish across only four pages), but it may have been enacted by Sir Benjamin Hammett, a former sheriff of London.\nHammett was also an MP, and in 1790 he introduced to Parliament a Bill for Altering the Sentence of Burning Women.\nHe denounced the punishment as \"the savage remains of Norman policy\" which \"disgraced our statutes\", as \"the practice did the common law\".\nHe also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution.", "High treason remained distinct though, from what became known as petty treason: the killing of a lawful superior, such as a husband by his wife.\nThough twelfth century contemporary authors made few attempts to differentiate between high treason and petty treason, enhanced punishments may indicate that the latter was treated more seriously than an ordinary felony.\nAs the most egregious offence an individual could commit, viewed as seriously as though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment.\nBut whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned.\nIn his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, \"to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive\", was \"full as terrible to the sensation as the other\".", "The change in execution venues, from Tyburn to Newgate, also attracted criticism.\nFollowing Phoebe Harris's burning in 1786, as well as questioning the inequality of English law The Times complained about the location of the punishment and its effect on locals: When remission of burning was refused, the scene of inhumanity should have been changed; the consequences have been serious; several persons in the neighbourhood of Newgate lying ill, have been severely affected by the smoke which issued from the body of the unhappy female victim.", "The newspaper asked \"why should the law in this species of offence inflict a severer punishment upon a woman, than upon a man\"?\nHarris's fate prompted William Wilberforce to sponsor a bill which, if passed, would have abolished the practice.\nBut as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers, the House of Lords rejected it.\nThough sympathetic to reform of England's Bloody Code, Lord Chief Justice Loughborough saw no need to change the law: \"Although the punishment, as a spectacle, was rather attended with circumstances of horror, likely to make a more strong impression on the beholders than mere hanging, the effect was much the same, as in fact, no greater degree of personal pain was sustained, the criminal being always strangled before the flames were suffered to approach the body\".", "Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A. caesarea-like species in Mexico.\nAmanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric.\nFurthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white.\nThe volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales.", "De heretico comburendo was repealed by the Act of Supremacy 1558, although that act allowed ecclesiastical commissions to deal with occasional instances of heresy.\nPersons declared guilty, such as Bartholomew Legate and Edward Wightman, could still be burned under a writ of de heretico comburendo issued by the Court of Chancery.\nThe burning of heretics was finally ended by the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677 which, although it allowed ecclesiastical courts to charge people with \"atheism, blasphemy, heresy, schism, or other damnable doctrine or opinion\", limited their power to excommunication.", "The law also allowed for the hanging of children aged seven years or more.\nMary Troke, \"but sixteen years of age\", was burned at Winchester in 1738 for poisoning her mistress.\nAn unidentified 14-year-old girl imprisoned at Newgate was more fortunate.\nFound guilty in 1777 of being an accomplice to treason, for concealing whitewashed farthings on her person (at her master's request), she had been sentenced to burn.\nShe was saved by the intervention of Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath, who happened to be passing.", "The west part of the Strand was in the parish of St Martin in the Fields and in the east it extended into the parishes of St Clement Danes and St Mary le Strand.\nMost of its length was in the Liberty of Westminster, although part of the eastern section in St Clement Danes was in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex.\nThe precinct of the Savoy, located approximately where the approach to Waterloo Bridge is now, had the Strand as its northern boundary.\nAll of these parishes and places became part of the Strand District in 1855, except St Martin in the Fields which was governed separately.\nThe Strand District Board of Works was based at No.\n22, Tavistock Street.", "William Wilberforce and Hammett were not the first men to attempt to end the burning of women.\nAlmost 140 years earlier, during the Interregnum, a group of lawyers and laymen known as the Hale Commission (after its chairman Matthew Hale), was tasked by the House of Commons to take \"into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law\".\nAmong the proposed reforms was the replacement of burning at the stake with hanging, but, mainly through the objections of various interested parties, none of the commission's proposals made it into law during the Rump Parliament.\nHammett was confident though.\nHe believed that public opinion was on his side and that \"the House would go with him in the cause of humanity\".", "Strand District was abolished in October 1900 and became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.\nFrom the 12th century onwards, large mansions lined the Strand including several palaces and townhouses inhabited by bishops and royal courtiers, mainly located on the south side, with their own river gates and landings directly on the Thames.\nThe road was poorly maintained, with many pits and sloughs, and a paving order was issued in 1532 to improve traffic.\nWhat later became Essex House on the Strand was

bolt driven into the top of the stake, was placed around her neck.\nAs prayers were read, the stool was taken away and over the course of several minutes, her feet kicking as her body convulsed, Harris choked to death.", "Apart from the rebuilt Somerset House, all of these buildings have been demolished and replaced from the 17th century onwards.", "But while 18th and 19th-century women guilty of treasonable crimes were still seen as villains, increasingly, the cause of their descent was ascribed to villainous men.\nThose people concerned about the brutality inflicted on condemned women were, in Gatrell's opinion, \"activated by the sense that even at their worst women were creatures to be pitied and protected from themselves, and perhaps revered, like all women from whom men were born.\"\nCommenting on Harris's execution, The Daily Universal Register claimed that the act reflected \"a scandal upon the law\", \"a disgrace to the police\" and \"was not only inhuman, but

peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A. muscaria was not practised by these peoples.\nIn western Siberia, the use of A. muscaria was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state.\n(Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.)\nIn eastern Siberia, A. muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously.\nIn eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine.\nThis urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the A. muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.", "Amanita muscaria contains several biologically active agents, at least one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive.\nIbotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with approximately 10 \u2013 20% converting to muscimol after ingestion.\nAn active dose in adults is approximately 6 mg muscimol or 30 to 60 mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of Amanita muscaria.\nThe amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue.", "After Elizabeth's death in 1603, it was owned by Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI and I.\nThe building was renamed Denmark House in commemoration of Anne's brother, Christian IV of Denmark.\nFollowing James' death in 1625, his body lay there intestate for a month.\nIt was taken over by Parliament in 1645 following the Civil War, renaming it back to Somerset House.", "Amanita muscaria poisoning has occurred in young children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience.\nOccasionally it has been ingested in error, because immature button forms resemble puffballs.\nThe white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and the mushrooms then may appear to be the edible A. caesarea.", "Medical attention should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning.\nIf the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours, activated charcoal is given.\nGastric lavage can be considered if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion.\nInducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended in any poisoning situations.\nThere is no antidote, and supportive care is the mainstay of further treatment for intoxication.\nThough sometimes referred to as a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended.\nIf a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints.\nA benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures.\nOnly small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol.\nRecurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required.\nSerious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation.\nHemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary.\nWith modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.", "At the base is a
