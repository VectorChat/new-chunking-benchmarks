["Williams asked, \u201cIf we come in with the retropack attached, what\u2019s the worst that could happen to us?\u201d Kranz could imagine Glenn\u2019s response if he could have heard that question: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018us\u2019?\u201d After a little more discussion, it was decided that they would keep an eye on it, but not to tell John Glenn because they didn\u2019t want to worry him.\nLeaving the retropack on could work, but only if all three retro rockets fired on time.\nIf they didn\u2019t, there was a chance one of the rockets could go off during reentry and kill Glenn.", "Glenn was troubleshooting some attitude control problems while Mission Control tried to make sense of the data they were getting from the remote sites.\nOnly about half those sites were seeing the Segment 51.\nSome of the design techs suggested making sure the landing bag switch was off and asking Glenn whether he had heard any banging noises when he maneuvered.\nWalt Williams and two of the designers joined Chris Kraft at his console and suggested leaving the retropack on during reentry in the hope it would keep the heat shield in place.\nKraft was convinced it was a false reading and didn\u2019t like that very much.", "The last orbit was the worst.\nThe controllers had no new data and they were trying to troubleshoot without letting Glenn know that he could be in serious trouble.\nGlenn figured out that something was up anyway and tried to get them to tell him what it was.\nWhen he returned to dry land, he would tell the controllers exactly what he thought of not having all the information available.\nAs it was, Glenn\u2019s response to the retropack plan was pretty tart: \u201cWhat is the reason for this?\nDo you have a reason?", "During the nineteenth orbit, Cooper\u2019s05 G indicator came on.\nThis would have meant that he had started reentry, but Cooper believed it was a false reading and disabled the fuses leading to it.\nThis disabled an automatic system that would have been used for retrofire.\nCooper would have to fire the retro rockets manually.\nKranz made sure the new plans went out to the remote stations and set up backup communications with John Glenn, the capcom on the Coastal Sentry.\nIt may have occurred to the control team that part of the reason Scott Carpenter had landed so far out of the planned recovery area was that he had fired the retros a few seconds late, but that was the biggest concern.", "Over.\u201d Shepard finally told him that they weren\u2019t sure whether the landing bag had deployed.\nAll three retro rockets fired on time and, as Glenn reentered, the Friendship 7 was surrounded by an ion buildup that blocked radio signals.\nIt was a tense wait for the people in Mission Control and those watching the live coverage of the mission.\nFinally, the spacecraft was spotted by the recovery ship USS Noa.\nJohn Glenn was brought on board to the cheers of the Noa\u2018s crew and got a taste of the nation-wide celebration to come when his route back to Cape Canaveral ended with an impromptu parade through the nearby Cocoa Beach.\nThe telemetry readings of the Segment 51 would turn out to be false.", "While going over the stowage and pre-retro checklists with the Zanzibar CapCom, Cooper reported, \u201cMy automatic control system inverter has failed.\nI\u2019ll have to make a manual reentry.\u201d Zanzibar asked, \u201cHave you tried the standby inverter?\u201d \u201cRoger.\nIt would not start.\u201d They continued with the checklist, and then Cooper made contact with Coastal Sentry: \u201cOh, my automatic inverter failed along with a few other odds and ends.\nI will shoot the retros on manual and then reenter manually also.", "The people in Mission Control wished he had reported it sooner.\nThough the astronauts and NASA medical staff had never gotten along, the flight surgeon could have helped.\nIt certainly didn\u2019t help Scweickart\u2019s reputation or the image of the tough astronaut.\nFortunately, he was still able to perform most of the work.\nTests of the Spider\u2018s thrusters and descent engine went well.\nThe next day, Schweickart was feeling well enough to try his EVA.\nRetrieving some science packets from outside the LM wore him out and they decided to call off the planned transfer to the command module.\nThey were ready for the real test.", "If that thing came off with Cernan nearby, they stood a chance of losing one astronaut.\nNASA didn\u2019t need that kind of poor publicity.\nHe was overridden and, even worse, Chris Kraft had done nothing to back him up.\nFurious, Kranz threatened to quit after the mission was over.\nKraft shrugged it off and ordered him to get the job done.\nHowever, Kranz still had one trump card.\nNo one could override a flight director when he was directing a mission in real time.\nIf it seemed like Cernan was having any kind of trouble, Kranz would wave him off.\nEven so, he spent a sleepless night going over possibilities.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of this, but I\u2019m showing an indication of Segment 51.\u201d This was more serious than the President\u2019s phone call.\nSegment 51 was the impact bag deploy.\nIf that had somehow come undone, the heat shield was loose and John Glenn would burn up when he reentered the atmosphere.\nAs they tried to track down the indication, the chief audio technician had the unfortunate duty of telling the president, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten pretty busy down here!\u201d The president answered, \u201cGive me a call when you get the chance.\u201d Some of the readouts suggested that the Segment 51 was a false alarm, but they couldn\u2019t be certain.", "The people on the ground concurred and recommended resetting the gyros.\nThis didn\u2019t help, and Carpenter ended up wasting a lot of fuel trying to correct until they suggested that he simply coast until he was ready to start the reentry sequence.\nAs Aurora 7 went into the final orbit, it became obvious that Carpenter would have to make a manual reentry.\nThe Capcom at the Hawaiian station talked him through the checklist for retrofire.\nIn the meantime, he was still having trouble with the temperature on his pressure suit and, by the end of his third orbit, was starting to show signs of overheating.\nAt one point, Chris Kraft snapped to Gus Grissom at CapCom, \u201cDammit, Gus, keep him on task.", "He felt that it could have been arranged in advance.\nKraft only replied, \u201cThe President is the boss.\u201d As it turned out, the audio technicians were better informed than he was and had been expecting the call.\nAlan Shepard told Glenn, \u201cSeven, this is the Cape.\nThe President will be talking to you.\u201d Glenn was as surprised as Kranz had been.\n\u201cAh, the President?\nThis is Friendship 7, standing by.\u201d They had trouble patching the President through.\nThe techs gestured to each other for assistance as they stammered out, \u201cHello, Mister President!\u201d In another part of the room, the man monitoring the spacecraft\u2019s systems got Kranz\u2019s attention.", "It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Llewellyn got curious and asked Kranz.\nKranz had a hard time keeping a straight face as he explained, \u201cWe have orders to patch communications through to Sealab so Carpenter can give the countdown for the retrofire.\nI argued with Kraft about it but he says, \u2018Do it!\n'\u201d Llewellyn was furious and inadvertently pulled Dave Scott into the gotcha by telling him all about the fictional test.\nScott blew up and threatened to quit the program if this was the kind of crazy decision he could expect during a mission.\nKranz let them both dangle for a few more minutes before explaining that it was all a joke.", "Luckily, they had spares on hand and they were able to replace it with only a minor delay.\nWalt Williams kept one eye on the weather while they waited.\nWhen the hold was over, Williams started the poll of the controllers, spacecraft and test conductors.", "Twenty minutes sped by fast and both the ground team and McDivitt prompted him to begin thinking about getting back into the spacecraft.\nMcDivitt told him, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get back in here before it gets dark.\u201d White reacted like a kid told to come in for supper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the saddest moment of my life.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re going to find it sadder when we have to come down with this whole thing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d White came back through the hatch and they wrestled to get the hatch closed.\nIt had lost its flexibility in the cold of space.\nMission Control had planned to jettison the now unnecessary EVA gear but decided not to press their luck.", "I am going to have it framed and hanged on the wall of my bathroom.\u201d Chris Kraft\u2019s patience was gone.\n\u201cYou have your orders, young man!\u201d If Kraft had his way, Hunter wasn\u2019t going to have much of a future in Mission Control.\nAt the customary party on the evening before the launch, the tension between Kraft, Kranz and Slayton had spread to the rest of the controllers and the astronauts and there was none of the usual mingling.\nLlewellyn had too much to drink and tried to start a fight with Alan Shepard.\nKranz intervened and got him out of there.", "Some intermittent communications problem gave Kraft\u2019s team headaches and caused Grissom to growl, \u201cHow can we get to the moon if we can\u2019t even talk between two buildings?\u201d They could have called it a day, but decided to give it another hour.\nThen, shouts from the cockpit sent chills down everybody\u2019s spine.\n\u201cFire!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fire in the cockpit!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bad fire, get us out!\nWe\u2019re burning up.\u201d Then, somebody screamed and they heard nothing else.", "\u201c1201-Executive Overflow-No vacant areas.\u201d For some reason, the computer was receiving more data than it could handle and had gone through a restart cycle.\nMission rules told him nothing, so he checked with his computer expert.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a BAILOUT alarm.\nThe computer is busier than hell and has run out of time to get all the work done.\u201d Still clueless, he watched the computer go through some more restarts.\nHe had to make up his mind.\n\u201cFlight, Guidance.\nSomething is wrong with the computer.\nI\u2019ve got a bunch of computer alarms.", "Do you know what it really takes to be an astronaut?\u201d \u201cNo, Jose, tell me.\u201d \u201cYou should have courage and the right blood pressure and four legs.\u201d \u201cWhy four legs, Jose?\u201d \u201cThey were going to send a dog.\nBut they decided that would be too cruel.\u201d Now who in the world would be playing a recording of comedian Bill Dana\u2019s cowardly astronaut routine at a time like this?\nKranz scrambled to find the cause.\nIf it was coming from anywhere in this room, he was history.\nBut, as it turned out, the launch pad crew were piping it into Shepard\u2019s spacecraft in an attempt to get him to lighten up.\nIt certainly added to the surreal feeling and got grins from a few people in Mission Control.", "Thinking fast, the crew abandoned the planned rendezvous maneuver and powered down equipment.\nKraft could have aborted the mission right then, but decided to give it a few more orbits to troubleshoot and see if the oxygen levels began to level out.\nTo be on the safe side, Kraft had recovery teams redeployed to emergency landing areas.\nThe White Team began to move into place to back up Kraft\u2019s Red Team.\nThe fuel cell situation began to stabilize, but it was obvious that they weren\u2019t able to operate at full power and some of the experiments were canceled.\nKraft wanted to go for a full day and began preparing for the handover.", "DPS DELTA V indicated that the thrust hadn\u2019t built up fast enough.\nThey would have to reset the timer.\nThe other one was simply labeled, FORGET IT.\nThis meant that the command to throttle up the engine had not been executed.\nThey extended the mission by an orbit to see if they could still accomplish all their goals.\nSending commands went from being a hassle to being a major problem due to poor signal strength.\nThe controllers ended up punching in commands manually.\nKranz did not want to lose the test of the LM\u2019s abort system, so he decided to ditch all the other tests if he absolutely had to and focus on that one.", "He backed down after the fifth day and the crew tried to make up for it by continuing the tradition of Schirra\u2019s humorous signs.\nKraft and Slayton broached the subject of keeping their helmets on during reentry and Schirra blew up.\nAs he later put it in a Sudafed commercial, \u201cHave you ever tried sneezing in one of these?\u201d On the one hand, keeping the helmets on would protect them if the cabin depressurized suddenly.\nOn the other, they still had the colds and risked ear blockage and possible hearing loss if they kept the helmets on.", "Glynn Lunney oversaw the launch and handed things over to Gene Kranz.\nThings seemed to be proceeding smoothly so far.\nThen, Schirra reported that he had developed a cold and taken an Aspirin.\nLuckily, they had Kleenex on board though Schirra reported that he had to blow pretty hard to clear his nostrils.\nThe flight surgeon recommended a decongestant.\nHis crewmates caught his cold and it did nothing for the mood of any of them.\nBy the third day, Schirra\u2019s bad temper was obvious enough for newspapers to comment, \u201cCaptain Awakes Grumpy.\u201d He curtly vetoed the TV show, leaving an embarrassed PR staff to explain that one to the press.", "Kranz considered the plan too risky and had his suspicions about who was behind it.\nBuzz Aldrin was one of the more loudly opinionated astronauts and had picked up the nickname of \u201cDr.\nRendezvous\u201d for his attempts to assist with rendezvous planning.\nHe was in the middle of explaining how the EVA might be done.\nKranz explained to the top players in the room that there was a lot of energy stored up in the shroud\u2019s release mechanism and Cernan would have nothing to latch onto while he worked.\nNewtonian physics applied while in orbit and just using a screwdriver could send him spinning if he had nothing to hold onto.", "I think he\u2019s delirious.\u201d Though California gave him the countdown for firing the retro-rockets, Carpenter hit the button three seconds too late.\nHe was going to land somewhere past the planned landing area.\nIt was questionable whether he could even get into the proper attitude for reentry and he would have to use the fly-by-wire system to keep his spacecraft from tumbling.", "The safest approach seemed to be taking some medical scissors to the lanyard.", "His team\u2019s handling of the crisis convinced Kranz that he was now a full-fledged flight director and, at the press conference at the end of the shift, he featured Aaron as the real hero for saving the fuel cell.\nThe mission made it almost the full eight days.\nKranz was forced to cut it one orbit short during his final shift so the crew wouldn\u2019t fall into a hurricane during reentry.", "The launch was set for January 27, 1962 and then scrubbed again due to a faulty tank bulkhead.\nThe next date was February 14, and they were forced to scrub one more time due to weather.\nJohn Glenn was actually the coolest of the lot by this point, losing his temper only once when somebody suggested that he could get kicked off his flight for supporting his wife when she didn\u2019t want to see the Vice President.\nFinally, they settled for February 20, 1962 for a launch date.\nKranz had watched enough Atlas rockets blow up to acknowledge that they were gambling with a man\u2019s life this morning.\nSomebody broke one of the hatch bolts while John Glenn was being inserted into the spacecraft.", "A few minutes later, he reported that the booster was moving away from the Gemini in a lower orbit.\nIt was a quick lesson in orbital mechanics.\nBy accelerating toward the Titan, McDivitt had boosted the Gemini into a higher orbit and lost ground speed.\nTo catch the booster, he would have had to drop into a lower orbit and gain ground speed.\nThat was counterintuitive to a pilot used to the idea that he had to accelerate toward the object he wanted to rendezvous with.\nAfter another attempt to rendezvous with the booster, Kraft decided that they should give it up.", "Because the Agena spacecraft had given them so many problems, nobody was taking any chances that it might misinterpret a command and go wild.\nThe Agena had an error checking routine that helped controllers verify that the command being put in the onboard computer\u2019s memory was the one they had sent.\nAs a backup, the remote site computers performed an echo check by automatically recording each command as it was converted into radio waves and checking it with the intended command load.\nIf the telemetry from the Agena\u2019s error checking routine failed, controllers could perform a manual check that would take several hours or save time by basing their decisions on the echo check.", "They took numerous pictures, including this iconic image of the Earth rising over the moon.\nThe crew had been working for almost a full day by this point and Borman decided that the crew should get some rest before the trans-Earth injection burn that would put them on course for the return to Earth.\nKranz was observing from one of the consoles in the back of the room when Bill Anders revealed his Christmas Eve surprise.\nHe began reading the Creation story from the Book of Genesis.\nKranz, a Catholic, felt chills go down his spine as Jim Lovell and then Frank Borman picked up the story.\nWhat could possibly be more appropriate?", "\u201cIt was gruesome,\u201d was all John Hodge could get out.\nChris Kraft was on the phone with Deke Slayton.\nSlayton described fire spewing out from inside the capsule and molten metal running down the sides.\nThere was nothing more they could do for the crew.\nThey had lost three pilots in the worst way imaginable, in a ground test that shouldn\u2019t have been much of a risk.\nMost thought it had taken only seconds.\nIt was a harsh reminder of the hazards of space flight.\nKranz organized a meeting of his branch and flight control team in a nearby auditorium.\nAt Hodge\u2019s request, he also included the civil servants, Philco controllers and spacecraft contractors.", "Just call me \u2018Aunt Emma\u2019; certainly some smart people may laugh at my concern, but I just feel that the crew should not be diddling around with the computer keyboard during powered descent unless absolutely necessary.\nThey will never hit a wrong button, of course, but if they do, the results can be really lousy.\u201d Many of his Tindallgram ideas were incorporated into the mission rules, including changing the Go/NoGo decisions to Stay/NoStay for actual lunar activity.\nFor his efforts, Bill Tindall became an honorary flight director with Gray as a team color and Kranz invited Tindall to sit beside him for the lunar landing.", "Simulated missions were one thing the mission controllers had in common with the astronauts.\nBrooks would throw every imaginable scenario at them to see how they handled it.\nOne time, the simulation supervisor (SimSup) decided Kraft was depending too much on Kranz and pulled him off.\n\u201cKranz had an accident on the way to MCC and is in the hospital,\u201d SimSup told Kraft.\nKranz protested, \u201cWhat are you doing?\nWe have a mission to prepare for!\u201d Kraft was amused.", "Abort the landing, abort!\u201d Kranz passed the abort command along to CapCom and it was executed perfectly.\nDick Koos told them, \u201cThat was not an abort.\nYou should have continued the landing.\u201d He skewered both Kranz and Bales for the mistake.\nIt was a lousy way to finish the team\u2019s training.\nSteve Bales was embarrassed and frustrated.", "Llewellyn resorted to high school geometry to determine that Carpenter was going to land at least 200 miles long.\nAs Carpenter began coming back into the atmosphere and they lost radio contact, all the people in the control room could do was pray.\nKranz had only felt this kind of helplessness when he held his wife\u2019s hand during childbirth.\nFinally, Grissom caught Carpenter\u2019s report that his chute had deployed and replied that they would get Air Rescue personnel to him within an hour.\nRescue personnel found an annoyed Carpenter munching on a candy bar.\nCarpenter was heard to comment, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d That made Llewellyn mad.", "I\u2019m looking to get a lot of experience on this flight.\u201d Glenn\u2019s response was a little sarcastic: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get it.\u201d Glenn gave the countdown for the retrofire.\nCooper made a nearly flawless reentry and, when complimented on a job well done, drawled in his Oklahoman accent, \u201cAw, shucks, we aim to please.\u201d The Gemini Project had the goals of developing many of the techniques and technologies needed to get to the Moon.\nGemini demonstrated extra-vehicular activity (EVA), rendezvous and docking techniques and man\u2019s ability to function in space for mission durations of up to two weeks.", "Somehow, they kept it to mere words and talked it out until three in the morning.\nThey cut a deal that would work for the short-term.\nHunter would be in charge of the station, and Conrad would be in charge of real-time operations during the mission.\nKranz had the changes Teletyped out to the remote stations in Carnarval and Hawaii.\nHunter didn\u2019t seem to know when to back down and, the day before Gemini 3 was due to launch, gave Kranz a message to relay to Kraft.\n\u201cThis message doesn\u2019t resolve anything.", "Kranz had taken up Judo at Llewellyn\u2019s invitation and realized that the evening\u2019s match was going to be an especially rough one.\nGemini 5 splashed down with a duration record under their belts and Mission Control began to look ahead to their first attempt at rendezvous and docking.\nThe planned star of the show was an automated spacecraft called Agena.\nSome of the MCC controllers were less than impressed, especially after one ground test in which faulty software sent every available command to the Agena.\nIf this had happened during an actual mission, they would have been in big trouble.\nTheir disparaging comments would turn out to be accurate.", "We failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked, they must be considered as one spacecraft, one integrated power system, and a single structure.\n\u201cThe next thing is that many of us did not trust the Agena.\nBrooks\u2019s team thought it was a great piece of hardware.\nIf we don\u2019t trust a spacecraft, we have to fix it.\nWe were lucky, too damned lucky, and we must never forget this mission\u2019s lessons.\u201d They were all lessons that would serve them well during the Apollo 13 crisis.\nFor the moment, they made the necessary changes and went forward into preparations for Gemini 9.", "He hung his white vest on a hook, his thoughts racing ahead to the news conference he now had to face.\nThough NASA\u2019s public-relations officers were not universally popular and often hated by the astronauts, Gene Kranz thought they really earned their pay when dealing with the press conferences.\nThis press conference did cause one lingering misconception about Kranz.\nThe blurbs about the flight directors in the press release said he looked like a poster boy for the Marines.\nThe press ate that one up and, from then on, Kranz felt like he was forever explaining that he was Air Force, not Marines.\nHe found a place at MCC to sleep until the end of the mission.", "The EVA ground team reviewed footage of Leonov\u2019s spacewalk and inspected hardware being developed for White\u2019s EVA with the goal of having everything ready two weeks before the scheduled launch date.\nIn the meantime, Marta had given birth to their fifth child.\nTheir house in Flight Controller Alley had become too small.\nWith Gene Kranz at work most of the time, she had to prepare for a move to Dickinson, Texas, alone.\nIt was her idea to make him a white vest representing his team\u2019s color that he could wear when leading the White Team during a mission.\nHe agreed to give it a try.", "A brainstorming session by the ATDA team failed to come up with any workable ideas.\nStafford suggested using the nose of the Gemini to nudge the shroud off and Kranz was quick to veto that idea.\nFor the time being, Kranz\u2019s team gave up on trying to get the shroud off.\nKranz went home for supper and to get some fresh clothes to bring back to MCC quarters.\nWhen he got back, he found out that somebody had come up with an idea of doing an EVA to release the shroud and went down to the ready room to see what he could find out.\nSome of NASA\u2019s top staffers were there.", "It took some doing, but the flight directors did their best to keep their cool with the crew and keep their flight teams on track.\nEven so, it took its toll and Lunney vented his frustration to Kranz during the last handover, \u201cI have finally had enough of this crew.\u201d Schirra got his way on the helmet issue and his crew made it down on schedule.\nIt was Schirra\u2019s third and last space flight and Eisele and Cunningham never flew in space again.\nLunney received a well-deserved medal for his efforts.\nKranz never found out why Schirra had been so bad-tempered and, after leaving NASA, Schirra went back to his normal funny self.", "For all that the other flight directors teased him about it, none of them could deny that they were tense today, as well.\nChris Kraft was sitting at the back of the room and kept asking Charlesworth about the status of the countdown.\nCharlesworth finally threatened to have him kicked out of the control room if he didn\u2019t cool it.\nThis was one of the few times when a flight director could talk back to his boss and Kraft desisted.\nAt first, the launch could have been just another simulation if it wasn\u2019t for the presence of luminaries like Bob Gilruth and the MCC\u2019s in-house PR representative, Jack Riley.", "If things got too bad, Slayton and Kraft could get involved and things tended to snowball when training for subsequent missions got pushed back.\nSixteen-hour days were

"Kranz expected a normal handover routine in which they would go over any outstanding issues.\nKraft was eager to get to the press conference and abruptly put his headset away.\nKranz didn\u2019t know if he had a plan.\n\u201cChris, what do you want to do?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the flight director; it\u2019s your shift.\nMake up your own mind.\u201d Kraft was handing him another test.\nGemini 5 was going to fly through a zone of poor coverage in the ground network and Kranz had an important Go/NoGo decision to make.", "He reported a spectacular sunrise, and then the glittering \u201cfireflies\u201d surrounding his spacecraft.\nThose fireflies would turn out to be drops of frozen water from the spacecraft.\nKraft was less than impressed when Kranz relayed that to him.\n\u201cKeep me advised.\u201d The first orbit came to an end with no problems worse than a slight increase of temperature in the cabin.\nThen, Kraft dropped a bombshell on Kranz: \u201cShorty Powers has confirmed that the President will make a call at the end of the first orbit.\nGet with the communications people and make sure everything is set up.\u201d Kranz didn\u2019t like that very much.", "Cernan went on to make the planned EVA.\nEven without going over to the Agena, it was a surprisingly tough job and he wore himself out just getting to the backpack stowed in a compartment outside the Gemini.\nHe was drenched with sweat and the evaporation fogged up his visor, blinding him.\nNASA physician Chuck Berry recommended rest breaks that didn\u2019t help much.\nCernan didn\u2019t need any prodding to give it up.\nWhite\u2019s easy EVA during Gemini 4 had fooled them all.\nEVA was harder than it looked and it was added to their list of problems to solve before the first moon landing.", "Marta made a special vest with gold and silver brocade over the familiar white for the next launch attempt.\nIt made an impression on visitors on June 3 and Kraft even made a few kidding comments.\nIt may have been a good luck charm.", "Systems engineer John Aaron had helped design the fuel cells and suggested running a load test.\nKranz had the crew power up and then send an oxygen purge through the fuel cell.\nThis would hopefully get rid of excess moisture and impurities in the cell.\nHe timed it so that, if something went wrong, they could run on batteries until they could get to a convenient spot to start reentry.\nThe fuel cell held up to the load test and Kranz watched the oxygen flow to the fuel cell begin to increase gradually.\nBy the time Hodge\u2019s Blue Team took over, they had worked out a plan to power up systems incrementally for the next few days.", "Gene Kranz summed it up at the debriefing.\n\u201cWe got our crew home safely and the control teams did a damn fine job under real-time pressure.\nI know this is going to sound like Monday morning quarterbacking, but the lessons from the mission are how we screwed up in planning and training.\n\u201cThe crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong.", "So they pulled out a new backup rendezvous vehicle called the augmented target docking adopter (ATDA), the mission was renamed Gemini 9A for the sake of bureaucracy and they scheduled the next launch attempt for June 1.\nThe ATDA launch went well but the controller for this new automated spacecraft reported that it was guzzling fuel and the adapter shroud might not have opened fully.\nA command shut down the ATDA\u2019s attitude control jets.\nIf the shroud hadn\u2019t opened fully, they might not be able to dock but that was a secondary objective.\nA failure in the ground support equipment forced them to scrub the Gemini launch for two days.", "Mission Control believed otherwise.\nKranz, in particular, felt that the astronautsproper role at the remote sites was as observers and assistants.\nFive days before the launch of the first manned Gemini, Astronauts Pete Conrad and Neil Armstrong went out to the remote sites at Carnarvon and Hawaii, respectively.\nOnce Pete Conrad got to Carnarvon, he encountered Dan Hunter, who was in charge of the station.\nBoth were equally strong-willed and it would lead to a showdown that would provide greater clarity of the roles of both Mission Control and the Astronaut Office during the flight.\nThe trouble started while Kranz and Kraft were still in Florida after Gemini 2.", "He would acknowledge that she was an extraordinary woman for sticking with him when he was spending so many long, stressful hours in the Mission Control Center.\nIn the meantime, the Atlas suffered two failures that needed to be sorted out before Cooper could go up in the Faith 7.\nThe launch was pushed back again when the Atlas booster failed an inspection on the launch pad.\nThe problems were solved and the booster passed a second inspection.\nThe launch date for the final Mercury flight was set for May 15, 1963.\nCooper\u2019s mission would last for 34 hours and 22 orbits.", "\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been benched.\u201d Von Ehrenfried filled in as assistant flight director and did fine.\nJust before Cooper\u2019s flight, he got a local hospital to provide an electrocardiogram of somebody having a heart attack, fed it into the simulation, and stood back and laughed up his sleeve while the physicians tried to figure it out.\nThat taught the physicians that an astronaut might not have time for doctors to argue over the diagnosis.\nBrooks became notorious for his challenging simulations.\nKranz\u2019s family was still growing.\nMarta gave birth to their fourth child, a boy, and the residents of Flight Controller Alley ganged up on Kranz to send him to her side while she was in labor.", "NASA procedure also called for nearly all communications between the crew and the ground to be available to the press.\nTo allow for limited private communications, Mission Control worked out a workaround code called UHF-6.\nIf either the ground or the crew requested a UHF-6 test, a private loop would be set up with a surgeon in the back room and the surgeon would privately brief the flight director afterwards.\nThe press was typically nosy, however, and Kranz tried to give them a runaround with highly technical jargon about communications and antenna.\nThat failed and he was forced to admit defeat.\nWith the Gemini 6 launch coming up, all the controllers were pulling exhausting double shifts.", "Harlan had exactly two worries at this point.\nNobody particularly liked the Gemini ejection system, so he did not want to call an abort when one wasn\u2019t necessary.\nNeither did he want to call an abort too late and risk losing a crew in a fireball.\nThe clock reached zero and the engines lit with the usual rumble intense enough to be felt inside the Gemini.\nThen, everything went quiet.\nFor an instant, Harlan wondered if they were having a repeat of \u201cKaputnik,\u201d an early American answer to Sputnik that had been lost in a launchpad explosion, with two crewmen inside.", "Both had been part of the trajectory team.\nThey had only two months to prepare for Gemini 9 and Kranz was forced to make an unpopular move.\nHe declared that there would be no holidays or vacations.\nSome of the controllerswives were quite annoyed and let him know about it.\nHe stuck to his guns and explained that astronautslives were on the line every time they sat on top of one of those rockets.\nDuring a launch, controllers had to be capable of making split-second decisions.\nWhenever a controller made a mistake in simulations, the worst that would happen was that he would get teased about it at the end of the day.\nIf it happened during a mission, the astronauts might not make it home.", "Nobody really expected him to obey.\nDuring the third orbit, Gemini 4 was given the Go to depressurize the spacecraft.\nWhile the air in the spacecraft was gradually reduced, McDivitt and White performed final checks on their spacesuits.\nAn inflated pressure suit was like a balloon with a man inside and White had difficulties getting through the hatch.\nHe made it, though, and cavorted around the Gemini with only a thruster gun to manuever.\nHe was obviously having a good time as he made observations on the Earth and space.", "Problems developed in the thrusters and seat tests and Kraft dived into the task of insuring that the control team was ready for any contingency.\nHe was still the senior flight director and gave Kranz the authority to do the same with his team.\nKranz assured him that he was already on the job.\nThen, Kranz got his first real test in his new role of flight director when Kraft became practically bedridden with influenza six days before the launch.\nThe job of handling the final simulation, pad tests and pre-launch briefings fell on Kranz\u2019s lap.", "There was a chance that Kranz would have to step into Kraft\u2019s place for the launch and he was so nervous that he clipped out a Sports Illustrated picture of a woman in a swimsuit for emotional support.\nKraft recovered enough to cover the actual launch and Kranz stepped back to his original role of insuring that the control teams and data network were ready.\nIt was one of the few unmanned shots covered by reporters in the control room and Kranz thought it was a bit much for an unmanned suborbital shot that had become nearly routine in the Mercury days.\nThere were so many cameras in the room that a fuse blew, plunging them into darkness.\nThis was where blindfold drills came in handy.", "The Americans scored their second space first when Armstrong reported, \u201cWe\u2019re docked, no noticeable oscillations, very smooth.\u201d Everything seemed to be going well, though CapCom Jim Lovell decided that Armstrong and Scott should be informed of the failed load comparison.\nA military coup in Zanzibar had forced NASA to move the remote station over to Madagascar and Gemini 8 was making a pass over it when Lovell told them, \u201cIf the Agena attitude control system goes wild, just send the command to turn it off and take control of the spacecraft.\u201d Everything looked normal when Gemini 8 flew into a zone of no coverage.", "Gemini 9 was just completing the third planned rendezvous when the White Team came back on duty.\nThe crew ended up saving Kranz from having to make a choice.\nThey were already exhausted and getting low on fuel.\nThey wanted to save the EVA for the next day.\nConsidering the circumstances, this was the equivalent of canceling it altogether.\nCapCom looked to Kranz for direction and a relieved Kranz gave him a thumbs-up.\n\u201cFlight concurs.\u201d Kranz had recently been offered a chance to return to test flight and would likely have done so if they had gone ahead with the plan to release the shroud.\nHe had dodged a bullet.", "Efforts to get them out took several minutes and they found the crew in a heap next to the hatch.\nThey had obviously been trying to undo it but simply couldn\u2019t in time.\nThe Aftermath Gene Kranz had just gotten dressed for a night out with his wife when he got a knock on the door.\nHe thought it was just the baby-sitter, so he called, \u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming.\u201d He went downstairs and the man at the door was flight controller Jim Hannigan.\n\u201cThey had a fire on the launchpad.\nThey think the crew is dead!\u201d Kranz turned on the TV to see what the reporters had found out so far.\nIt wasn\u2019t much.\nChris Kraft had acted quickly to lock down Mission Control so they could investigate.", "If he needed an assist to wind down, he could go to the doctors for a double shot of whiskey to put in his coffee.\nHe found out fast that whiskey and coffee were not a good combination.\nOther controllers didn\u2019t like the idea of relying on drugs to get to sleep and did without.", "Gemini 4 splashed down on June 27 after a successful mission.\nMarta was happy that her white vest had gone over so well and Kranz had an idea that she could make a more flashy vest he could wear at the end of a mission to signal his team that they had done a good job.\nGemini-Titan 5 Kranz\u2019s team came up with a surprise for him in the form of an American flag he could keep in his office and bring down to Mission Control at the beginning of each mission.\nIt saw its first use on August 21, 1965, at the launch of Gemini-Titan 5, an eight-day mission set to beat Russia\u2019s endurance record and put the U.S. in the lead.", "NAA took the EOR side, which would give them full control of manufacturing the spacecraft.\nNorth American turned out a spacecraft that was so riddled with problems that Gus Grissom hung a lemon on it.\nPerhaps someone should have taken the hint.\nThe \u201cplugs-out\u201d test scheduled for January 27, 1967, was considered to be low-risk.\nThe crew were in their pressure suits, in a one hundred percent oxygen atmosphere, and locked in with a newly redesigned hatch that would not blow off by accident.\nThe crew were Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom, Gemini 4 Spacewalker Ed White and a rookie astronaut named Roger Chaffee.", "In the meantime, Ed White was preparing for his EVA.\nThis would mean exposing the entire interior of the spacecraft to vacuum.\nThere would be nothing between the astronauts and instant death but their thin space suits and helmets.\nThe team decided to give him an extra orbit to get through his checklist.\nNo one knew what to expect.\nDeke Slayton had told McDivitt that if White was having problems outside that could endanger both of them, he should simply close the hatch and come home.", "With each \u201cGo,\u201d the room became more electrified.\nScott Carpenter called from the blockhouse, \u201cGodspeed, John Glenn!\nThree seconds, two, one, zero!\u201d As the Friendship 7 lifted off, Kranz jotted down some notes that included the time of liftoff in Greenwich time (14:14:39Z) and headed over to the Teletype machine to have the information sent to Bermuda.\nAlan Shepard, in the CapCom position, relayed the \u201cGo\u201d for seven orbits.\nThough the flight plan only called for three, the extra orbits would give them some extra time if they couldn\u2019t bring Friendship 7 down as planned.", "\u201cSpaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity and neglect.\nSomewhere, somehow, we screwed up.\nIt could have been in design, build or test.\nWhatever it was, we should have caught it.\n\u201cWe were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw in each day of our work.\nEvery element of the program was in trouble and so were we.\nThe simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed Daily.\nNothing we did had any shelf life.\nNot one of us stood up and said, \u2018Dammit, stop!\u201cI don\u2019t know what Thompson\u2019s committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find.", "The signal from the spacecraft was relayed from Cape Canaveral to the station in Bermuda, and then on to the Canary Islands.\nAn ex-Marine named Llewellyn was in charge at Canary Islands and stammered a bit as he asked Glenn for the spacecraft status.\nAs Glenn rattled off readings, Kranz couldn\u2019t resist smiling.\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one who was nervous.\nBut there was an overtone of victory, as well, and he resisted the urge to yell, \u201cWe\u2019ve got an American in orbit!\u201d NASA had really come a long way since \u201cThe Four Inch Flight.\u201d Glenn\u2019s reports could have been mesmerizing if Kranz didn\u2019t have a job to focus on.", "Having to walk on site will maybe put a dent in his thick skull.\u201d Kranz doubted it and Llewellyn proved him right when he showed up with his own horse the very next day.\nWhenever Gemini 7 flew into gaps in ground coverage, Kranz drilled his team in the fine art of handling two flights at once.\nIt was a nightmare for the CapComs and the computer people, who had to learn how to switch between the programs for each mission in an instant.\nOne little glitch could bring the computer system down.\nEarly in the morning of December 12, 1965, Kranz\u2019s team was exhausted but ready when they handed things over to Hodge\u2019s Blue Team.", "Though neither side in the Space Race had mastered rendezvous yet, the Russians had already demonstrated their capacity for running two missions at once.\nCould the Americans do the same?\nThey were certainly going to find out and Gemini 6 and 7 came to be known collectively as Gemini 7/6.\nGemini 7/6 Some people at the Cape weren\u2019t too thrilled with the idea of a dual mission, mostly because it added quite a bit of complexity to their normal work.\nMSC chief Robert Gilruth was a quick convert and a review by Kranz\u2019s team revealed no problems that they couldn\u2019t solve or work around.\nThe Gemini 7 crew, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, welcomed the idea.", "When he found out the truth, he chalked it up to the fact that if you asked enough experts, you would eventually find one nay-sayer.\nSlayton took charge of the astronaut corps, an important job that must have felt like a consolation prize.\nCarpenter swung right into preparations and named his spacecraft the Aurora 7.\nThe flight date was changed to give him more time for training.\nThe Friendship 7 had proven the value of having a man in control of the spacecraft and they hoped to expand on it with Aurora 7.\nThe plan also included observations of the spectacular sunsets and sunrises that John Glenn has reported, as well as Earth and space.", "Things were going reasonably well until Slayton was making a centrifuge run and the physician detected a minor heart fibrillation.\nHe stopped the run and reported it.\nEven then, Slayton didn\u2019t expect problems.\nHe had made test flights in the F-105 without any trouble and didn\u2019t expect this to be any more serious.\nIt didn\u2019t turn out that way and Slayton was yanked from the flight.\nNormally, Wally Schirra would have stepped up to the plate as his backup, but they gave the flight to Scott Carpenter instead.\nAt first, Kranz thought Slayton had been pulled off the flight because he complained too much about the experiments he was supposed to perform on the flight.", "The crew came up with the names of Gumdrop for the CSM and Spider for the LM.\nThat got chuckles from some of the controllers while PR staff howled in outrage at the undignified names.\nThe entire crew caught colds before the launch date of February 28.", "Many of these new people were brand-new graduates from colleges around Texas.\nA basic training course for flight controllers was set up.\nThe first class of six spent two weeksworth of twelve-hour days learning learning Morse code and speed printing.\nKranz handed out their flight controllerscertificates himself, and then the first class went out to the remote sites.\nA few of the controllers posted in unfriendly territories like Zanzibar had military experience that served them well when they ran across such obstacles as burning roadblocks and hostile natives.", "Inspections revealed that an umbilical had released prematurely and a dust cover also hadn\u2019t been removed.\nSome people may have thought of \u201cThe Four-Inch Flight,\u201d in which a power cord had also caused a premature shutdown by disconnecting early.\nOnce again, they were lucky.", "The crew was Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad.\nCooper had come up with the slogan \u201cEight Days or Bust\u201d for the mission.\nThe public relations department didn\u2019t like that very much and suppressed it until after the mission.\nConrad had recovered nicely from his spat with Hunter before Gemini 3 and Kranz liked his intensity and honesty.\nIt turned out to be a good match for Gemini 5.\nThe oxygen flow to the fuel cells dropped to alarming levels during the first orbit.", "Hodge started the meeting with a briefing that included the information they knew so far.\nThen, Kranz took the podium.\nHe had gone from shock to anger and wanted to say something that would snap the people out of their own shock.\nHe had not planned a speech, but the words seemed to flow naturally anyway.", "\u201cThat SOB is lucky to be alive.\u201d From then on, whenever someone wanted to get Llewellyn to tell the story, all they had to do was repeat the line, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d Kranz felt that a combination of a distracted crewman, too many scientific experiments, and ground crew taking too long to remind him of checklists had almost cost them an astronaut.\nThey had gotten lucky, but Kranz wanted to eliminate luck as a factor in future space flights.\nIn any case, Carpenter would go on to participate in Sealab and never flew a space mission again.", "Kranz worked by feel and the mission came off reasonably well for the fact that they weren\u2019t really prepared for a power failure in the control center.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston adapted its electrical systems so that wouldn\u2019t happen in the future and camera crews were required to provide their own power when covering future space missions.\nTug Of War Even though everybody in NASA had the same goal of going to the Moon, there were frequent disagreements about how to get there and who was in charge of what.\nMission Control got into a tug-of-war with the astronaut office over who, exactly, was in charge of the remote stations.", "Things went smoothly at first, with Cooper ticking off his experiments on schedule and the shift change occurring on schedule as Faith 7 was progressing along its sixth orbit.\nHodge had a different approach to mission control than Kraft did.\nKraft was a very hands-on mentor of the young mission controllers and comfortable with his status as team leader.\nHodge tried to obtain a consensus before making a decision, was good with people but didn\u2019t seem quite so comfortable with his leadership role.\nKranz remembered him as a nice guy.", "His attitude could be abrasive and he didn\u2019t get along well with some of the flight directors.\nKranz thought he did fine as long as he was kept on a short leash.\nCharlie Duke joined the team as Kranz\u2019s CapCom.\nHe integrated with the team so well that Kranz thought that he would have made an excellent flight director.\nWhile establishing the mission rules, Bill Tindall livened things up with his Tindallgrams.\nA typical Tindallgram might read: \u201cThere is another thing about powered descent crew procedures that really bugged me.", "Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White and Chaffee.\nThese words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.\u201d The official investigation would reveal that the fire had started somewhere near Gus Grissom\u2019s seat.\nThere was some speculation that Grissom could have done something to cause the fire, which the controllers and engineers who were most involved in the project thought was pure nonsense.\nThe fire had started in an area that Grissom couldn\u2019t reach from his seat, even by accident.", "It seemed like the U.S. couldn\u2019t score a space first for anything and Chris Kraft seemed distracted when Kranz delivered a report on the Gemini 3 mission to his office.\nWhen Kranz finished giving a verbal summary, Kraft walked across his office and closed the door.\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re ready as a flight director for Gemini 4 because there\u2019s a job I want you to do for me.\u201d Gemini 4 was already a packed four-day mission and NASA chiefs had decided to add an EVA by Ed White.\nKraft wanted Kranz to work with the Crew Systems Division on planned altitude chamber tests and put together the mission rules and data packet for America\u2019s first spacewalk.", "Either way, the launch was successful that day.\nThe crew rendezvoused with the ATDA on the third orbit and confirmed Mission Control\u2019s suspicions about the shroud.\nIt was only partly open and held in place by a band.\n\u201cIt looks like an angry alligator,\u201d reported Stafford.\nMission Control sent several rapid maneuver commands in an attempt to jettison the shroud with no luck.\nIn the meantime, the Gemini left the Agena, orbited Earth one more time, and returned for a second rendezvous.", "The Gemini 3 crew, Gus Grissom and John Young, had been unaware of trouble before the party but it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out that something was up.\nKranz decided that this was no way to run a mission.\nThe first manned Gemini mission launched on March 23, 1965.\nThough the official documentation called it Gemini-Titan 3, Gus Grissom had named the spacecraft the Molly Brown.\nNASA Public Relations hated it but the name was all over the newspapers after the Houston Capcom gave them the send-off, \u201cYou\u2019re on your way, Molly Brown!\u201d The mission was a success.\nAfter Grissom and Young splashed down, Kraft went to Slayton and cut a deal.", "Then, he checked his readouts.\n\u201cNo liftoff!\u201d he told the flight director over the communications loop.\nIn the Gemini, nobody would have particularly blamed Wally Schirra if he had activated the ejection system.\nHowever, he was cool as a cucumber and realized that it would have been the wrong move.\nHe would comment later that having been through a launch once before helped.\nHe knew what liftoff felt like and knew by the lack of rising G-forces that they were still on the launchpad.\nHe and Stafford kept rattling off numbers.\nThe ground crew moved swiftly through the launch kill procedures.\nThe Titan\u2019s systems detected that launch hadn\u2019t occurred and engines shut down automatically.", "A new influx of college graduates were brought in to maintain the new technology and bring the control team up to speed.\nKranz had only limited experience with computers and had to scramble to catch up.\nThe residents of Flight Controller Alley spent almost two years preparing for the first Gemini launch and became a close-knit bunch in the process.\nOne of Kranz\u2019s contribution was a mock-up of a Gemini cockpit.\nHe wanted his team to become nearly as familiar with the spacecraft\u2019s controls as the astronauts would be.", "Gemini 6 was a success and came home the next day.\nAt the press conference, the reporters played a gotcha on Gene Kranz by bringing along a bottle of what they claimed was champagne for a toast.\nIt turned out to be Canada Dry ginger ale.\nGemini 7 went on to set an American endurance record that would stand until Skylab eight years later.\nAfter the success of Gemini 7/6, many of the controllers began to move over to Apollo, draining the Gemini team enough that Mission Control decided to go with a two-shift rotation for Gemini 8.\nGemini 8 March 16, 1966 Having only two shifts for a mission was a staffing mistake they never made again.", "The team\u2019s performance went downhill from there.\nIt got so bad that Chris Kraft gave Kranz a call.\n\u201cI listened to your runs today.\nSounds like you had a tough time.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kranz assured his boss that his team was only having a bad day and would get through it with more training and revisions of the mission rules.\nThings did improve for a while.", "They were up for a two-week mission in a spacecraft that wasn\u2019t very big and the rendezvous would give them a break in the monotony.\nThe plan was to launch Gemini 7 and promptly swing into action to prepare the same pad for the launch of Gemini 6.\nThe pad and the surrounding area would be checked for debris.\nThe pad would be checked for damage, and then the Titan with the Gemini 6 spacecraft on top would be brought out to the pad and inspected.\nIf everything went smoothly, Gemini 6 would launch one week after Gemini 7.\nMission deployment began on November 21 and SimSup began running the controllers through their paces."]
