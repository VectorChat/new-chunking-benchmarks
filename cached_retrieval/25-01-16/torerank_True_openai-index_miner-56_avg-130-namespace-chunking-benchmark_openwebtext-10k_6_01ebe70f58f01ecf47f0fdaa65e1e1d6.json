carefully designated.", "Even the provision of one or two counter-examples- an editorial here, a column there- would hardly offset the general impression of a conspiracy of low-key mumbles, if not outright silence, on the gendercidal assault against ethnic-Albanian males.\n(19) The release of about two thousand men from Smrekovnica and other Serb detention facilities, in late May 1999, marked the one occasion on which victimized males came to the forefront of the discussion.\nThe result was some solid and nuanced reporting of the men's experiences.", "But men remain the \"absent subjects,\" entering the narrative only indirectly and by inference, if at all.\n(8) A more subtle version of the exclusionary strategy can be seen in the following passages: Several dozen Kosovo Albanians, many of them women and children, were hiding there in the hills when about six Serbian paramilitaries found them and shot the men, demanding to know where they were hiding their weapons, villagers said.\n(Fisher, 1999a.)", "One can see glimmers of comprehension in the occasional references to a pattern of male-selective killing in the Balkans conflict, and the attention paid to the phenomenon of male detentions and disappearances after the release of the inmates from Smrekovnica and Liplje prisons in May 1999 (see below).\nBut the coverage in no way approximated the kind of nuanced historical analysis that imbued treatments of Kosovo's women rape victims.\nFor the most part, the civilian male victims of the slaughter were buried in a slew of other designations-

April called for Yugoslavia to \"take immediate steps to punish the perpetrators of rape and other crimes..\" (Rubin quoted in Agence France-Presse, 1999c.)", "Many of the refugees were exhausted,

machetes.)\nObviously, Mr. Milosevic and his subordinates are brutal enough to do that.\nIf they haven't done it already (and there is no testimony that they have on that scale) it may well be because they fear that such annihilation would make an invasion inevitable.", "Here, the male is defined by some trait or label other than gender- even when gender obviously, or apparently, is decisive in shaping the experience or predicament being described.\nDuring the Kosovo war, typical displacement terminology included designations such as \"Kosovars,\" \"ethnic Albanians,\" \"bodies,\" \"victims,\" and \"people.\"\nIn this context, consider Daniel Williams' report in The Washington Post on the mass murder at Istok prison, a facility bombed by NATO planes in late May 1999.", "Good as Daniszewski's piece was, though, it again limited itself to the Kosovo context, failing to place the gendercide in regional, let alone global-historical, perspective.\nThis largely exhausted the

dropped in as an afterthought.", "A full sensitivity was evident to both the gender and age variables as they had shaped the atrocities so far.\nSomething of the process and periodicity of slaughter that often occurs in these cases was acknowledged (i.e., with the reference that the destruction of Kosovar civilians could proceed in two phases, the \"threatening\" males first, then the \"women,

that \"Such separations of men from women was [sic] commonplace in massacres carried out during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia between Moslems, Serbs and Croats.\"\n(Agence France-Presse, 1999d.)\nTo be sure, this is not a very extensive or sophisticated third-order framing, and the depiction of gendercide in Bosnia as the result of a \"war.. between Moslems, Serbs and Croats\" rather blurs the primary agents of the slaughter.", "In a late section of the paper, I also explore some of the more accurate and responsible media coverage of male victimization in the Kosovo conflict.\nAlthough such
