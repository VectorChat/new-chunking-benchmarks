best described as metonymic, since it involves a cause-effect association between the basic meaning of sharp and what the Pragglejaz Group call the \u201ccontextual\u201d meaning of the adjective (i.e., the particular kind of pain sensation evoked in the extract).\nIn contrast, the pain experiences described as sharp in extracts (3) and (4) do not arise as responses to injuries inflicted by

introspective simulators for the fear, distress and helplessness associated with being assaulted by a malevolent agent.\nAny such simulation would be more sustained than in the case of the previous

the sensations conveyed by the English word pain tend to be described via expressions that refer to potential causes of bodily damage.", "More specifically, metaphorical uses accounted for over 85 per cent of the instances of the above expressions in close proximity to pain\nThe rest of this paper will therefore be concerned primarily with metaphorical uses of \u201c CAUSES OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE

\u201d domain in the figurative description of pain in English (see also Deignan, Littlemore, and Semino, forthcoming Deignan, A., Littlemore, J and Semino, E. forthcoming.", "As a consequence, the use of the sharp in both (3) and (4) can be described as metaphorical.\nExample (5) differs from all previous examples in that the pain that is being described by sharp (as well as by the simile as if stabbed in the gut ) is primarily emotional: the character in question has just discovered that her husband has been unfaithful to her.", "None of the expressions that form the local textual pattern in this extract have conventional metaphorical uses to do with the sensation of pain: in fact, garden rake, and any scenario normally associated with it, would normally be unrelated to physical harm but rather have positive emotional associations.\nFor all these reasons, I would argue, this example is likely to facilitate a rich and intense simulation of what it would be like to be in that very specific pain-inducing situation.", "The top 62 collocates of this string include eight expressions that can be subsumed under the \u201c CAUSES OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE \u201d domain (NB: the numbers in

strong basis in metonymy, as they rely on common cause-effect associations for the experience of nociceptive pain in particular (see Lascaratou, 2007 Lascaratou, C. 2007.\nThe language of pain: Expression or description Amsterdam: John Benjamins.\n, pp.\n164-5).\nThe uses of the adjective sharp in the following extracts from the British National Corpus (hereafter BNC) can help to clarify the
