two phases of a three-phase study were carried out to determine the effects of the dam on fisheries.\nCompleted in 2005, the third phase of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water introduction and that water fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning.\nLarge mouth bass populations have also declined but striped bass have entered the lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP water.\nAround the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila

fairy tale \"Beauty and the Beast\" into an animated feature film.\nAlthough originally conceived as an animated film with \"no songs in it whatsoever\" under the direction of Richard Purdum, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg was unsatisfied with the dark and somber direction in which the film was headed, and ultimately ordered that it be re-written as a \"Broadway-style musical with a strong

for life, and stay together year-round.\nMated pairs sometimes sing together before nesting.\nDuring courtship they may also participate in a bonding behavior where the male collects food and brings it to the female, feeding her beak-to-beak.\nIf the mating is successful, this mate-feeding may continue throughout the period of incubation.\nMales sometimes bring nest material to the female, who does most of the building.\nShe crushes twigs with her beak until they are pliable, then turns in the nest to bend the twigs around her body and push them into a cup shape with her feet.\nThe cup has four layers: coarse twigs (and sometimes bits of trash) covered in a leafy mat, then lined with grapevine bark and finally grasses, stems, rootlets, and pine needles.\nThe nest typically takes three to nine days to build; the finished product is 5.1-7.6 cm (2.0-3.0 in) tall, 10.1 cm (4.0 in) across, with an inner diameter of about 7.6 cm (3.0 in).\nCardinals do not usually use their nests more than once.\nThe female builds a cup nest in a well-concealed spot in dense shrub or a low tree 1-3 m (3.3-9.8 ft) off the ground.\nThe nest is made of thin twigs, bark strips, and grasses, lined with grasses or other plant fibers.\nEggs are laid one to six days following the completion of the nest.\nThe eggs are white, with a tint of green, blue or brown, and are marked with lavender, gray, or brown blotches which are thicker around the larger end.\nThe shell is smooth and slightly glossy.\nThree or four eggs are laid in each clutch.\nEggs measure approximately 26 mm \u00d7 19 mm (1.02 in \u00d7 0.75 in) in size.\nThe female generally incubates the eggs, though, rarely, the male will incubate for brief periods of time.\nIncubation takes 12 to 13 days.\nYoung fledge 10 to 11 days after hatching.\nTwo to three, and even four, broods are raised each year.\nThe male cares for and feeds each brood as the female incubates the next clutch of eggs.\nThe oldest wild cardinal banded by researchers lived at least 15 years and 9 months, although 28.5 years was achieved by a captive bird.\nAnnual survival rates for adult northern cardinals have been estimated at 60 to 65%; however, as with other passerine birds, the high mortality of juveniles means that the average lifespan is only about a year.", "\"Belle\" has been universally acclaimed by film and music critics.\nMusically, the song has been compared to various musical numbers from the musical films West Side Story (1961) and The Sound of Music (1965), as well as the Broadway musicals Fiddler on the Roof and She Loves Me.\nAt the 64th Academy Awards in 1992, \"Belle\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, but ultimately lost to the film's title song.\nThe song was similarly featured in the

include corn (maize) and oats, sunflower seeds, the blossoms and bark of elm trees, and drinks maple sap from holes made by sapsuckers, an example of commensalism.\nDuring the summer months it shows
