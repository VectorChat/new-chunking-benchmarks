; only 10 % of Republicans blamed the legislature more and only 2 % of DFLers blamed Dayton more\nFollowing the shutdown DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns in the event of disagreements between the governor and legislature as she had done in several past sessions\nThe House commissioned a policy brief from its research

found the average bite force for this species in the wild to be 95 N with a maximum of 135 N while under experimental conditions sharks could be induced to bite with over 200 N of force\nLarge horn
