classified in two ways\nOn the one hand there is the detached academic philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves : this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function\nThen there is the practical utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use\nCultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code\nThis Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce\nThose cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria : they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name ; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations ( except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name ) ; it

into 698 genera with illustrations\nThe establishment of this precursor of scientific classification vastly improved the organisation of plant variation into approximately equivalent groups or ranks
