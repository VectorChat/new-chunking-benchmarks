["Gemini 6 October 25, 1965 looked like a beautiful morning for the planned double launch.\nThe Agena would go up first to set up the conditions of the rendezvous.\nWally Schirra and Tom Stafford waited in their Gemini for the second launch.\nThe Agena launch went smoothly.\nThe Atlas booster separated from the automated spacecraft on schedule and the Agena lit its engine.\nThen, the data on FIDO\u2019s console stopped updating.\nThey had lost contact with the Agena.\nThe Gemini 6 countdown continued until Range Safety reported debris falling into the ocean.\nWhen it became obvious that the Agena had exploded, Kranz\u2019s team decided that there was no point in launching the Gemini and called it a day.", "Either way, the launch was successful that day.\nThe crew rendezvoused with the ATDA on the third orbit and confirmed Mission Control\u2019s suspicions about the shroud.\nIt was only partly open and held in place by a band.\n\u201cIt looks like an angry alligator,\u201d reported Stafford.\nMission Control sent several rapid maneuver commands in an attempt to jettison the shroud with no luck.\nIn the meantime, the Gemini left the Agena, orbited Earth one more time, and returned for a second rendezvous.", "Because the Agena spacecraft had given them so many problems, nobody was taking any chances that it might misinterpret a command and go wild.\nThe Agena had an error checking routine that helped controllers verify that the command being put in the onboard computer\u2019s memory was the one they had sent.\nAs a backup, the remote site computers performed an echo check by automatically recording each command as it was converted into radio waves and checking it with the intended command load.\nIf the telemetry from the Agena\u2019s error checking routine failed, controllers could perform a manual check that would take several hours or save time by basing their decisions on the echo check.", "We failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked, they must be considered as one spacecraft, one integrated power system, and a single structure.\n\u201cThe next thing is that many of us did not trust the Agena.\nBrooks\u2019s team thought it was a great piece of hardware.\nIf we don\u2019t trust a spacecraft, we have to fix it.\nWe were lucky, too damned lucky, and we must never forget this mission\u2019s lessons.\u201d They were all lessons that would serve them well during the Apollo 13 crisis.\nFor the moment, they made the necessary changes and went forward into preparations for Gemini 9.", "Gemini 8 was only half an orbit from rendezvousing with the Agena when the CapCom on Rose Knot reported that they had lost the automatic data comparison on the Agena.\nThe Agena systems engineer tried to rerun it, and then began printing out the memory data for the manual check.\nThe echo check looked okay, so Gemini 8 approached the Agena as planned, Rose Knot gave everything one last check, and the controllers gave the Go for docking.", "Efforts to get them out took several minutes and they found the crew in a heap next to the hatch.\nThey had obviously been trying to undo it but simply couldn\u2019t in time.\nThe Aftermath Gene Kranz had just gotten dressed for a night out with his wife when he got a knock on the door.\nHe thought it was just the baby-sitter, so he called, \u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming.\u201d He went downstairs and the man at the door was flight controller Jim Hannigan.\n\u201cThey had a fire on the launchpad.\nThey think the crew is dead!\u201d Kranz turned on the TV to see what the reporters had found out so far.\nIt wasn\u2019t much.\nChris Kraft had acted quickly to lock down Mission Control so they could investigate.", "Kranz had taken up Judo at Llewellyn\u2019s invitation and realized that the evening\u2019s match was going to be an especially rough one.\nGemini 5 splashed down with a duration record under their belts and Mission Control began to look ahead to their first attempt at rendezvous and docking.\nThe planned star of the show was an automated spacecraft called Agena.\nSome of the MCC controllers were less than impressed, especially after one ground test in which faulty software sent every available command to the Agena.\nIf this had happened during an actual mission, they would have been in big trouble.\nTheir disparaging comments would turn out to be accurate.", "Glynn Lunney oversaw the launch and handed things over to Gene Kranz.\nThings seemed to be proceeding smoothly so far.\nThen, Schirra reported that he had developed a cold and taken an Aspirin.\nLuckily, they had Kleenex on board though Schirra reported that he had to blow pretty hard to clear his nostrils.\nThe flight surgeon recommended a decongestant.\nHis crewmates caught his cold and it did nothing for the mood of any of them.\nBy the third day, Schirra\u2019s bad temper was obvious enough for newspapers to comment, \u201cCaptain Awakes Grumpy.\u201d He curtly vetoed the TV show, leaving an embarrassed PR staff to explain that one to the press.", "By the time the launch day for Gemini 8 arrived, Kranz and Hodge were both exhausted from planning, training, mission reviews and press conferences.\nThe crew, Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott, were going to rendezvous and dock with an Agena.\nThe Agena control team was made up of novices but was balanced out by an experienced Gemini team.\nThis time, Hodge\u2019s team got both the Agena and the Gemini on their way smoothly.\nThe crew and Mission Control were preparing for final rendezvous maneuvers when the White Team came on duty.\nMission Control and the remote sites used timed-tagged stored program commands (SPC) to control the unmanned Agena.", "Thinking fast, the crew abandoned the planned rendezvous maneuver and powered down equipment.\nKraft could have aborted the mission right then, but decided to give it a few more orbits to troubleshoot and see if the oxygen levels began to level out.\nTo be on the safe side, Kraft had recovery teams redeployed to emergency landing areas.\nThe White Team began to move into place to back up Kraft\u2019s Red Team.\nThe fuel cell situation began to stabilize, but it was obvious that they weren\u2019t able to operate at full power and some of the experiments were canceled.\nKraft wanted to go for a full day and began preparing for the handover.", "We need to get going on our own work.\u201d Kranz just handed over the logbook, went down to his office to get a little work done, and then knocked off early to beat the rush hour traffic.\nThe crew received their \u201cgo\u201d to enter the capsule.\nGrissom plugged his suit into the oxygen supply and immediately reported a sour smell.\nHodge paused the countdown for air sampling and the countdown resumed at 1:25 p.m. Chris Kraft had planned to head up his Red Team for the launch and went down to the MCC for the planned handover.\nHodge decided to hang around in case the test dragged on as it had for some of the plugs-in work.", "Problems developed in the thrusters and seat tests and Kraft dived into the task of insuring that the control team was ready for any contingency.\nHe was still the senior flight director and gave Kranz the authority to do the same with his team.\nKranz assured him that he was already on the job.\nThen, Kranz got his first real test in his new role of flight director when Kraft became practically bedridden with influenza six days before the launch.\nThe job of handling the final simulation, pad tests and pre-launch briefings fell on Kranz\u2019s lap.", "Hodge\u2019s Blue Team had been on duty for eleven hours and was exhausted, so Hodge asked Kranz to take over.\nKranz called in his White Team and contacted recovery forces.\nGemini 8 was going to come down in an area not covered by the recovery network.\nArmstrong wasn\u2019t very happy about having to abort and spend time floating in the western Pacific Ocean but started the reentry procedures.\nGemini 8 lasted only ten hours and forty-one minutes but the rookie Agena team got two more days to practice controlling the Agena.\nThough Gemini 8 had been abortive, NASA had learned some important lessons.", "If that thing came off with Cernan nearby, they stood a chance of losing one astronaut.\nNASA didn\u2019t need that kind of poor publicity.\nHe was overridden and, even worse, Chris Kraft had done nothing to back him up.\nFurious, Kranz threatened to quit after the mission was over.\nKraft shrugged it off and ordered him to get the job done.\nHowever, Kranz still had one trump card.\nNo one could override a flight director when he was directing a mission in real time.\nIf it seemed like Cernan was having any kind of trouble, Kranz would wave him off.\nEven so, he spent a sleepless night going over possibilities.", "Luckily, they had spares on hand and they were able to replace it with only a minor delay.\nWalt Williams kept one eye on the weather while they waited.\nWhen the hold was over, Williams started the poll of the controllers, spacecraft and test conductors.", "Gene Kranz summed it up at the debriefing.\n\u201cWe got our crew home safely and the control teams did a damn fine job under real-time pressure.\nI know this is going to sound like Monday morning quarterbacking, but the lessons from the mission are how we screwed up in planning and training.\n\u201cThe crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong.", "Cernan went on to make the planned EVA.\nEven without going over to the Agena, it was a surprisingly tough job and he wore himself out just getting to the backpack stowed in a compartment outside the Gemini.\nHe was drenched with sweat and the evaporation fogged up his visor, blinding him.\nNASA physician Chuck Berry recommended rest breaks that didn\u2019t help much.\nCernan didn\u2019t need any prodding to give it up.\nWhite\u2019s easy EVA during Gemini 4 had fooled them all.\nEVA was harder than it looked and it was added to their list of problems to solve before the first moon landing.", "During the nineteenth orbit, Cooper\u2019s05 G indicator came on.\nThis would have meant that he had started reentry, but Cooper believed it was a false reading and disabled the fuses leading to it.\nThis disabled an automatic system that would have been used for retrofire.\nCooper would have to fire the retro rockets manually.\nKranz made sure the new plans went out to the remote stations and set up backup communications with John Glenn, the capcom on the Coastal Sentry.\nIt may have occurred to the control team that part of the reason Scott Carpenter had landed so far out of the planned recovery area was that he had fired the retros a few seconds late, but that was the biggest concern.", "The Americans scored their second space first when Armstrong reported, \u201cWe\u2019re docked, no noticeable oscillations, very smooth.\u201d Everything seemed to be going well, though CapCom Jim Lovell decided that Armstrong and Scott should be informed of the failed load comparison.\nA military coup in Zanzibar had forced NASA to move the remote station over to Madagascar and Gemini 8 was making a pass over it when Lovell told them, \u201cIf the Agena attitude control system goes wild, just send the command to turn it off and take control of the spacecraft.\u201d Everything looked normal when Gemini 8 flew into a zone of no coverage.", "When they regained contact, Armstrong and Scott were rolling at a rate of one complete rotation per second.\nAt that rate, they risked blacking out.\nThe roll had started when they were still docked to the Agena and they had undocked, thinking something had gone wrong with the automated spacecraft.\nAs it turned out, one of their own thrusters was stuck open.\nArmstrong drained the orbital fuel trying to get the Gemini back under control and had to fire the reentry thrusters to stop the roll.\nThey would have to come back home.", "The NAA fought them on issues like releasing technical details of the spacecraft and assigning representatives to the control center to help with preparations.\nThey even got into the ongoing debate about the route they would take to the moon.\nOne favorite route was called Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR), in which astronauts would rendezvous with a spacecraft already in orbit and land that spacecraft on the moon.\nAnother route was an underdog called Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR), in which a crew of three astronauts would go into lunar orbit, and then two of them would undock in a smaller spacecraft and land it on the moon.", "Some intermittent communications problem gave Kraft\u2019s team headaches and caused Grissom to growl, \u201cHow can we get to the moon if we can\u2019t even talk between two buildings?\u201d They could have called it a day, but decided to give it another hour.\nThen, shouts from the cockpit sent chills down everybody\u2019s spine.\n\u201cFire!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fire in the cockpit!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bad fire, get us out!\nWe\u2019re burning up.\u201d Then, somebody screamed and they heard nothing else.", "They had nailed six tough simulations, boosting their confidence.\nThe 12 prime crew switched places with their backup crew.\nThis would be the final simulation before Launch Day and Kranz\u2019s mind was already on the bits of business he had to take care of before the launch.\nIt turned out to be a mistake.\nSimSup had \u201cCase Number 26\u201d loaded into the simulation computers and told his men, \u201cOK, gang, let\u2019s see how much they know about program alarms.\u201d The GUIDO, Steve Bales, spotted a 1201 alarm on his readouts.\nHe had to look it up in an index file.", "For all that the other flight directors teased him about it, none of them could deny that they were tense today, as well.\nChris Kraft was sitting at the back of the room and kept asking Charlesworth about the status of the countdown.\nCharlesworth finally threatened to have him kicked out of the control room if he didn\u2019t cool it.\nThis was one of the few times when a flight director could talk back to his boss and Kraft desisted.\nAt first, the launch could have been just another simulation if it wasn\u2019t for the presence of luminaries like Bob Gilruth and the MCC\u2019s in-house PR representative, Jack Riley.", "We are the cause!\nWe were not ready!\nWe did not do our job!\nWe were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when we knew in our hearts it would take a miracle.\nWe were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did.", "To cover it, Mercury Control operated in two shifts for the first time.\nJohn Hodge became flight director for the second shift and Kranz was assigned to his team as assistant flight director.\nKranz had forgiven Cooper for the wild car ride on his first day of work and liked him for his fun-loving spirit.\nHowever, Cooper was not universally popular.\nA few people were hesitant about his Oklahoman accent, which made him sound like a back-waters country boy, and he nearly got yanked from the mission when he rattled nerves by buzzing the control center in a T-38.\nThe launch went off as planned at 8:04 AM EST.", "\u201cIt was gruesome,\u201d was all John Hodge could get out.\nChris Kraft was on the phone with Deke Slayton.\nSlayton described fire spewing out from inside the capsule and molten metal running down the sides.\nThere was nothing more they could do for the crew.\nThey had lost three pilots in the worst way imaginable, in a ground test that shouldn\u2019t have been much of a risk.\nMost thought it had taken only seconds.\nIt was a harsh reminder of the hazards of space flight.\nKranz organized a meeting of his branch and flight control team in a nearby auditorium.\nAt Hodge\u2019s request, he also included the civil servants, Philco controllers and spacecraft contractors.", "DPS DELTA V indicated that the thrust hadn\u2019t built up fast enough.\nThey would have to reset the timer.\nThe other one was simply labeled, FORGET IT.\nThis meant that the command to throttle up the engine had not been executed.\nThey extended the mission by an orbit to see if they could still accomplish all their goals.\nSending commands went from being a hassle to being a major problem due to poor signal strength.\nThe controllers ended up punching in commands manually.\nKranz did not want to lose the test of the LM\u2019s abort system, so he decided to ditch all the other tests if he absolutely had to and focus on that one.", "Inspections revealed that an umbilical had released prematurely and a dust cover also hadn\u2019t been removed.\nSome people may have thought of \u201cThe Four-Inch Flight,\u201d in which a power cord had also caused a premature shutdown by disconnecting early.\nOnce again, they were lucky.", "The last orbit was the worst.\nThe controllers had no new data and they were trying to troubleshoot without letting Glenn know that he could be in serious trouble.\nGlenn figured out that something was up anyway and tried to get them to tell him what it was.\nWhen he returned to dry land, he would tell the controllers exactly what he thought of not having all the information available.\nAs it was, Glenn\u2019s response to the retropack plan was pretty tart: \u201cWhat is the reason for this?\nDo you have a reason?", "Llewellyn resorted to high school geometry to determine that Carpenter was going to land at least 200 miles long.\nAs Carpenter began coming back into the atmosphere and they lost radio contact, all the people in the control room could do was pray.\nKranz had only felt this kind of helplessness when he held his wife\u2019s hand during childbirth.\nFinally, Grissom caught Carpenter\u2019s report that his chute had deployed and replied that they would get Air Rescue personnel to him within an hour.\nRescue personnel found an annoyed Carpenter munching on a candy bar.\nCarpenter was heard to comment, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d That made Llewellyn mad.", "Twenty minutes sped by fast and both the ground team and McDivitt prompted him to begin thinking about getting back into the spacecraft.\nMcDivitt told him, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get back in here before it gets dark.\u201d White reacted like a kid told to come in for supper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the saddest moment of my life.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re going to find it sadder when we have to come down with this whole thing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d White came back through the hatch and they wrestled to get the hatch closed.\nIt had lost its flexibility in the cold of space.\nMission Control had planned to jettison the now unnecessary EVA gear but decided not to press their luck.", "Things went smoothly at first, with Cooper ticking off his experiments on schedule and the shift change occurring on schedule as Faith 7 was progressing along its sixth orbit.\nHodge had a different approach to mission control than Kraft did.\nKraft was a very hands-on mentor of the young mission controllers and comfortable with his status as team leader.\nHodge tried to obtain a consensus before making a decision, was good with people but didn\u2019t seem quite so comfortable with his leadership role.\nKranz remembered him as a nice guy.", "I am going to have it framed and hanged on the wall of my bathroom.\u201d Chris Kraft\u2019s patience was gone.\n\u201cYou have your orders, young man!\u201d If Kraft had his way, Hunter wasn\u2019t going to have much of a future in Mission Control.\nAt the customary party on the evening before the launch, the tension between Kraft, Kranz and Slayton had spread to the rest of the controllers and the astronauts and there was none of the usual mingling.\nLlewellyn had too much to drink and tried to start a fight with Alan Shepard.\nKranz intervened and got him out of there.", "Kranz considered the plan too risky and had his suspicions about who was behind it.\nBuzz Aldrin was one of the more loudly opinionated astronauts and had picked up the nickname of \u201cDr.\nRendezvous\u201d for his attempts to assist with rendezvous planning.\nHe was in the middle of explaining how the EVA might be done.\nKranz explained to the top players in the room that there was a lot of energy stored up in the shroud\u2019s release mechanism and Cernan would have nothing to latch onto while he worked.\nNewtonian physics applied while in orbit and just using a screwdriver could send him spinning if he had nothing to hold onto.", "There was a chance that Kranz would have to step into Kraft\u2019s place for the launch and he was so nervous that he clipped out a Sports Illustrated picture of a woman in a swimsuit for emotional support.\nKraft recovered enough to cover the actual launch and Kranz stepped back to his original role of insuring that the control teams and data network were ready.\nIt was one of the few unmanned shots covered by reporters in the control room and Kranz thought it was a bit much for an unmanned suborbital shot that had become nearly routine in the Mercury days.\nThere were so many cameras in the room that a fuse blew, plunging them into darkness.\nThis was where blindfold drills came in handy.", "Bob Carlton, dubbed \u201cThe Silver Fox\u201d for his gray hair, became CONTROL, responsible for LM navigation, control and navigation systems.\nAmong other things, he would be responsible for keeping track of how much fuel remained on the LM.\nDon Puddy became TELMU, responsible for communications, power and life support systems.\nHe appointed himself leader of the lunar module team.\nSteve Bales became GUIDO, responsible for guidance systems.\nHe had the black round-rimmed glasses characteristic of his nature as a computer whiz, and had a habit of speaking rapidly.", "Harlan had exactly two worries at this point.\nNobody particularly liked the Gemini ejection system, so he did not want to call an abort when one wasn\u2019t necessary.\nNeither did he want to call an abort too late and risk losing a crew in a fireball.\nThe clock reached zero and the engines lit with the usual rumble intense enough to be felt inside the Gemini.\nThen, everything went quiet.\nFor an instant, Harlan wondered if they were having a repeat of \u201cKaputnik,\u201d an early American answer to Sputnik that had been lost in a launchpad explosion, with two crewmen inside.", "A few minutes later, he reported that the booster was moving away from the Gemini in a lower orbit.\nIt was a quick lesson in orbital mechanics.\nBy accelerating toward the Titan, McDivitt had boosted the Gemini into a higher orbit and lost ground speed.\nTo catch the booster, he would have had to drop into a lower orbit and gain ground speed.\nThat was counterintuitive to a pilot used to the idea that he had to accelerate toward the object he wanted to rendezvous with.\nAfter another attempt to rendezvous with the booster, Kraft decided that they should give it up.", "The walls of the LM were so thin that a good poke with a pencil would have punched a hole right through them.\nThey wouldn\u2019t have worked in an atmosphere and were so ungainly-looking that the astronauts called the training version \u201cflying bedsteads.\u201d It was a good chance to try out a few new controllers who had come on board since Gemini.\nKranz would need them.\nThree days before the launch, LM control engineer got into a traffic accident on his way to work.\nWhile he was still able to cover the actual launch, he was unable to move his upper body and could only communicate with the help of fellow controller Bob Carlton.\nThe launch went smoothly, and then they ran into two alarms at once.", "Borman and Lovell successfully rendezvoused with their own booster and flew in formation for a while.\nThen, they got started on medical experiments.\nThe suits might have been lightweight, but Borman and Lovell had a repeat of Scott Carpenter\u2019s suit heating problems during Aurora 7.\nWhen the crew reached Day 3 with little relief, Lovell stripped off his suit.\nMission Control wanted to let both of them remove their suits when medical data showed that Lovell was sleeping better, but NASA management refused to allow it.\nControl even tried playing the media card and told the press that the crew risked overheating in those suits to no avail.\nBorman and Lovell had to take turns wearing the suits.", "Williams asked, \u201cIf we come in with the retropack attached, what\u2019s the worst that could happen to us?\u201d Kranz could imagine Glenn\u2019s response if he could have heard that question: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018us\u2019?\u201d After a little more discussion, it was decided that they would keep an eye on it, but not to tell John Glenn because they didn\u2019t want to worry him.\nLeaving the retropack on could work, but only if all three retro rockets fired on time.\nIf they didn\u2019t, there was a chance one of the rockets could go off during reentry and kill Glenn.", "A brainstorming session by the ATDA team failed to come up with any workable ideas.\nStafford suggested using the nose of the Gemini to nudge the shroud off and Kranz was quick to veto that idea.\nFor the time being, Kranz\u2019s team gave up on trying to get the shroud off.\nKranz went home for supper and to get some fresh clothes to bring back to MCC quarters.\nWhen he got back, he found out that somebody had come up with an idea of doing an EVA to release the shroud and went down to the ready room to see what he could find out.\nSome of NASA\u2019s top staffers were there.", "Glenn was troubleshooting some attitude control problems while Mission Control tried to make sense of the data they were getting from the remote sites.\nOnly about half those sites were seeing the Segment 51.\nSome of the design techs suggested making sure the landing bag switch was off and asking Glenn whether he had heard any banging noises when he maneuvered.\nWalt Williams and two of the designers joined Chris Kraft at his console and suggested leaving the retropack on during reentry in the hope it would keep the heat shield in place.\nKraft was convinced it was a false reading and didn\u2019t like that very much.", "I think he\u2019s delirious.\u201d Though California gave him the countdown for firing the retro-rockets, Carpenter hit the button three seconds too late.\nHe was going to land somewhere past the planned landing area.\nIt was questionable whether he could even get into the proper attitude for reentry and he would have to use the fly-by-wire system to keep his spacecraft from tumbling.", "Somehow, they kept it to mere words and talked it out until three in the morning.\nThey cut a deal that would work for the short-term.\nHunter would be in charge of the station, and Conrad would be in charge of real-time operations during the mission.\nKranz had the changes Teletyped out to the remote stations in Carnarval and Hawaii.\nHunter didn\u2019t seem to know when to back down and, the day before Gemini 3 was due to launch, gave Kranz a message to relay to Kraft.\n\u201cThis message doesn\u2019t resolve anything.", "Marta made a special vest with gold and silver brocade over the familiar white for the next launch attempt.\nIt made an impression on visitors on June 3 and Kraft even made a few kidding comments.\nIt may have been a good luck charm.", "The crew came up with the names of Gumdrop for the CSM and Spider for the LM.\nThat got chuckles from some of the controllers while PR staff howled in outrage at the undignified names.\nThe entire crew caught colds before the launch date of February 28.", "They took numerous pictures, including this iconic image of the Earth rising over the moon.\nThe crew had been working for almost a full day by this point and Borman decided that the crew should get some rest before the trans-Earth injection burn that would put them on course for the return to Earth.\nKranz was observing from one of the consoles in the back of the room when Bill Anders revealed his Christmas Eve surprise.\nHe began reading the Creation story from the Book of Genesis.\nKranz, a Catholic, felt chills go down his spine as Jim Lovell and then Frank Borman picked up the story.\nWhat could possibly be more appropriate?", "Systems engineer John Aaron had helped design the fuel cells and suggested running a load test.\nKranz had the crew power up and then send an oxygen purge through the fuel cell.\nThis would hopefully get rid of excess moisture and impurities in the cell.\nHe timed it so that, if something went wrong, they could run on batteries until they could get to a convenient spot to start reentry.\nThe fuel cell held up to the load test and Kranz watched the oxygen flow to the fuel cell begin to increase gradually.\nBy the time Hodge\u2019s Blue Team took over, they had worked out a plan to power up systems incrementally for the next few days.", "Things were going reasonably well until Slayton was making a centrifuge run and the physician detected a minor heart fibrillation.\nHe stopped the run and reported it.\nEven then, Slayton didn\u2019t expect problems.\nHe had made test flights in the F-105 without any trouble and didn\u2019t expect this to be any more serious.\nIt didn\u2019t turn out that way and Slayton was yanked from the flight.\nNormally, Wally Schirra would have stepped up to the plate as his backup, but they gave the flight to Scott Carpenter instead.\nAt first, Kranz thought Slayton had been pulled off the flight because he complained too much about the experiments he was supposed to perform on the flight.", "Tindall won their respect quickly enough and they spent a lot of time debating ideas.\nKranz had to fight the urge to jump in and help.\nThis was his first mission as FCD chief and he was understandably keyed up.\nHis team assured him that everything was on schedule and, the evening before the launch, they got a surprise visitor.\nCharles Lindbergh stopped by to say hello and Kranz chose to interpret it as a good sign.\n\u201cLucky Lindy\u201d had been the first to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and it seemed to Kranz like he was silently passing the baton on to the next generation of pioneers.", "Envisioning explosions and an inferno that consumed the entire pad, he rushed to the Center and had trouble finding a parking space.\nEvery available controller was reporting in to see what they could do to help.\nThe controllers still in the control room were too stunned to say much.\nThose still capable of focusing were going over data at their stations.\nMost of the rest were milling around, trying to make sense of the tragedy.", "Over.\u201d Shepard finally told him that they weren\u2019t sure whether the landing bag had deployed.\nAll three retro rockets fired on time and, as Glenn reentered, the Friendship 7 was surrounded by an ion buildup that blocked radio signals.\nIt was a tense wait for the people in Mission Control and those watching the live coverage of the mission.\nFinally, the spacecraft was spotted by the recovery ship USS Noa.\nJohn Glenn was brought on board to the cheers of the Noa\u2018s crew and got a taste of the nation-wide celebration to come when his route back to Cape Canaveral ended with an impromptu parade through the nearby Cocoa Beach.\nThe telemetry readings of the Segment 51 would turn out to be false.", "Cooper made some celestial observations and took several pictures of Earth and celestial objects during a quiet period in his schedule, and then set a milestone of his own when he became the first American to sleep in orbit.\nHis heart rate dropped low enough to alarm the physicians, who had CapCom wake him briefly to make certain he was okay.\nThe team fell into a mode of relaxed alertness and kept an eye on things until Kraft\u2019s team came back on duty.", "The culprit was a switch that had been accidentally bumped.\nSwitch covers would be included in the future.\nA few hours later, the Spider finally came out of the compartment.\nFor such a fragile spacecraft, the Spider held up well to the repeated firings of the Gumdrop\u2018s main engine over the next few days.\nThey were just getting ready to power up the Spider for testing when McDivitt sprang an unpleasant surprise on them.\nSchweickart had been space sick for days and might not be able to perform a planned spacewalk that would have taken him from the lunar module to the command module.", "The people in Mission Control wished he had reported it sooner.\nThough the astronauts and NASA medical staff had never gotten along, the flight surgeon could have helped.\nIt certainly didn\u2019t help Scweickart\u2019s reputation or the image of the tough astronaut.\nFortunately, he was still able to perform most of the work.\nTests of the Spider\u2018s thrusters and descent engine went well.\nThe next day, Schweickart was feeling well enough to try his EVA.\nRetrieving some science packets from outside the LM wore him out and they decided to call off the planned transfer to the command module.\nThey were ready for the real test.", "Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White and Chaffee.\nThese words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.\u201d The official investigation would reveal that the fire had started somewhere near Gus Grissom\u2019s seat.\nThere was some speculation that Grissom could have done something to cause the fire, which the controllers and engineers who were most involved in the project thought was pure nonsense.\nThe fire had started in an area that Grissom couldn\u2019t reach from his seat, even by accident.", "Wally Schirra and Tom Stafford were up bright and early on launch day and went through the traditional launch routine that included a \u201clow-residue\u201d breakfast, a medical checkup, and suiting up for the ride.\nThe countdown went smoothly.\nThere were two abort controls that could be activated if there was trouble.\nOne was in Mission Control between booster engineer Charlie Harlan and CapCom C.C.\nWilliams.\nThe other was in the Gemini, located where Wally Schirra could grab and yank it.", "Training started eight weeks before the planned launch date.\nThey ran through the planned mission for the first couple of days to identify major Go/NoGo points and get a feel for what a \u201cnormal\u201d mission with no problems would be.\nA new SimSup named Dick Koos continued the tradition of imaginative simulation scripts that helped the control team refine procedures and mission rules.\nNot everything went perfectly.\nThe crew and controllers often trained together and that meant the computer network between the control room and crew simulators needed to stay up and running.\nWhen it didn\u2019t, SimSup had to contend with impatient astronauts and controllers while technicians tried to troubleshoot.", "The LM was in good shape and Dave Scott reported that it looked good on his end, so Kranz gave them the go for separation.\nThe descent propulsion system quickly moved the Spider away from Gumdrop and Scott reported that he could see it to a distance of fifty miles.\nThey kept going out to one hundred miles.\nThe Spider\u2018s crew now had to reverse course and head back to the Gumdrop.\nThis meant firing the ascent engine as if they were returning from the moon.\nIf it didn\u2019t work, Dave Scott would have to perform the first space rescue and track them down.\nThe Spider successfully flew back to the point where Scott could dock with them again.\nThe highlights of the mission were a success.", "The EVA ground team reviewed footage of Leonov\u2019s spacewalk and inspected hardware being developed for White\u2019s EVA with the goal of having everything ready two weeks before the scheduled launch date.\nIn the meantime, Marta had given birth to their fifth child.\nTheir house in Flight Controller Alley had become too small.\nWith Gene Kranz at work most of the time, she had to prepare for a move to Dickinson, Texas, alone.\nIt was her idea to make him a white vest representing his team\u2019s color that he could wear when leading the White Team during a mission.\nHe agreed to give it a try.", "His team\u2019s handling of the crisis convinced Kranz that he was now a full-fledged flight director and, at the press conference at the end of the shift, he featured Aaron as the real hero for saving the fuel cell.\nThe mission made it almost the full eight days.\nKranz was forced to cut it one orbit short during his final shift so the crew wouldn\u2019t fall into a hurricane during reentry.", "It took some doing, but the flight directors did their best to keep their cool with the crew and keep their flight teams on track.\nEven so, it took its toll and Lunney vented his frustration to Kranz during the last handover, \u201cI have finally had enough of this crew.\u201d Schirra got his way on the helmet issue and his crew made it down on schedule.\nIt was Schirra\u2019s third and last space flight and Eisele and Cunningham never flew in space again.\nLunney received a well-deserved medal for his efforts.\nKranz never found out why Schirra had been so bad-tempered and, after leaving NASA, Schirra went back to his normal funny self.", "NASA procedure also called for nearly all communications between the crew and the ground to be available to the press.\nTo allow for limited private communications, Mission Control worked out a workaround code called UHF-6.\nIf either the ground or the crew requested a UHF-6 test, a private loop would be set up with a surgeon in the back room and the surgeon would privately brief the flight director afterwards.\nThe press was typically nosy, however, and Kranz tried to give them a runaround with highly technical jargon about communications and antenna.\nThat failed and he was forced to admit defeat.\nWith the Gemini 6 launch coming up, all the controllers were pulling exhausting double shifts.", "Gene Kranz could only think: \u201cWell, let them get on with their great plans.\nI\u2019m gonna put a man in orbit first.\u201d The second suborbital, Liberty Bell 7 manned by Gus Grissom, was nearly a carbon copy of Freedom 7, though the capsule sank and Grissom nearly drowned.\nThe helicopter crews seemed more worried about retrieving the capsule than rescuing Grissom.\nKranz growled to his console, \u201cForget the capsule, just get Gus.\u201d Grissom barely made it out of there by grabbing a line from one of the helicopters.", "If he needed an assist to wind down, he could go to the doctors for a double shot of whiskey to put in his coffee.\nHe found out fast that whiskey and coffee were not a good combination.\nOther controllers didn\u2019t like the idea of relying on drugs to get to sleep and did without.", "Kranz described the moment when he heard Shepard had entered his spacecraft as \u201csurreal.\u201d This was the moment they had all waited for since signing up.\nThen, things started to go south.\nThey sat through five delays and the weather started to foul up.\nSome of them had to wonder if they were going to face another scrubbed launch.\nPencils tapped on desks and, during one delay, Kraft asked Kranz to get him a pint of milk from the lunch wagon to help calm his stomach.\nShepard was even less patient and barked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fix your little problem and light this candle?\u201d And then the most astonishing routine came over the communications loop.", "He reported a spectacular sunrise, and then the glittering \u201cfireflies\u201d surrounding his spacecraft.\nThose fireflies would turn out to be drops of frozen water from the spacecraft.\nKraft was less than impressed when Kranz relayed that to him.\n\u201cKeep me advised.\u201d The first orbit came to an end with no problems worse than a slight increase of temperature in the cabin.\nThen, Kraft dropped a bombshell on Kranz: \u201cShorty Powers has confirmed that the President will make a call at the end of the first orbit.\nGet with the communications people and make sure everything is set up.\u201d Kranz didn\u2019t like that very much.", "\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been benched.\u201d Von Ehrenfried filled in as assistant flight director and did fine.\nJust before Cooper\u2019s flight, he got a local hospital to provide an electrocardiogram of somebody having a heart attack, fed it into the simulation, and stood back and laughed up his sleeve while the physicians tried to figure it out.\nThat taught the physicians that an astronaut might not have time for doctors to argue over the diagnosis.\nBrooks became notorious for his challenging simulations.\nKranz\u2019s family was still growing.\nMarta gave birth to their fourth child, a boy, and the residents of Flight Controller Alley ganged up on Kranz to send him to her side while she was in labor.", "They were up for a two-week mission in a spacecraft that wasn\u2019t very big and the rendezvous would give them a break in the monotony.\nThe plan was to launch Gemini 7 and promptly swing into action to prepare the same pad for the launch of Gemini 6.\nThe pad and the surrounding area would be checked for debris.\nThe pad would be checked for damage, and then the Titan with the Gemini 6 spacecraft on top would be brought out to the pad and inspected.\nIf everything went smoothly, Gemini 6 would launch one week after Gemini 7.\nMission deployment began on November 21 and SimSup began running the controllers through their paces.", "Kranz worked by feel and the mission came off reasonably well for the fact that they weren\u2019t really prepared for a power failure in the control center.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston adapted its electrical systems so that wouldn\u2019t happen in the future and camera crews were required to provide their own power when covering future space missions.\nTug Of War Even though everybody in NASA had the same goal of going to the Moon, there were frequent disagreements about how to get there and who was in charge of what.\nMission Control got into a tug-of-war with the astronaut office over who, exactly, was in charge of the remote stations.", "Abort the landing, abort!\u201d Kranz passed the abort command along to CapCom and it was executed perfectly.\nDick Koos told them, \u201cThat was not an abort.\nYou should have continued the landing.\u201d He skewered both Kranz and Bales for the mistake.\nIt was a lousy way to finish the team\u2019s training.\nSteve Bales was embarrassed and frustrated.", "Finally, the countdown resumed and reached zero at 9:34 am Eastern standard time.\nKranz was so excited that, when he left his station to go over to the Teletype machine, he forgot to remove his headset.\nThe cord snagged a chair and knocked it over.\nHe picked it up just as Shepard made his thirty-second report.\nThe Freedom 7 reached an apogee of 116 miles and Shepard tested roll, pitch and yaw manuevers as planned.\nThis assured the doctors whom Kranz considered too conservative that humans could function in space.", "While going over the stowage and pre-retro checklists with the Zanzibar CapCom, Cooper reported, \u201cMy automatic control system inverter has failed.\nI\u2019ll have to make a manual reentry.\u201d Zanzibar asked, \u201cHave you tried the standby inverter?\u201d \u201cRoger.\nIt would not start.\u201d They continued with the checklist, and then Cooper made contact with Coastal Sentry: \u201cOh, my automatic inverter failed along with a few other odds and ends.\nI will shoot the retros on manual and then reenter manually also.", "He would acknowledge that she was an extraordinary woman for sticking with him when he was spending so many long, stressful hours in the Mission Control Center.\nIn the meantime, the Atlas suffered two failures that needed to be sorted out before Cooper could go up in the Faith 7.\nThe launch was pushed back again when the Atlas booster failed an inspection on the launch pad.\nThe problems were solved and the booster passed a second inspection.\nThe launch date for the final Mercury flight was set for May 15, 1963.\nCooper\u2019s mission would last for 34 hours and 22 orbits.", "It would be Gene Kranz\u2019s last Gemini mission before he moved over to the Apollo project.\nThe Angry Alligator With John Hodge moving over to Apollo, Gene Kranz was the only one of the original three flight directors left in Gemini.\nGlynn Lunney and Cliff Charlesworth were promoted to fill the role.\nLunney was the youngest flight director and earned a reputation as one of the smartest.\nKranz thought of him as his main competitor.\nCharlesworth had a background in Army ordnance labs and earned the nickname \u201cThe Mississipi Gambler\u201d for his laid-back personality.", "So they pulled out a new backup rendezvous vehicle called the augmented target docking adopter (ATDA), the mission was renamed Gemini 9A for the sake of bureaucracy and they scheduled the next launch attempt for June 1.\nThe ATDA launch went well but the controller for this new automated spacecraft reported that it was guzzling fuel and the adapter shroud might not have opened fully.\nA command shut down the ATDA\u2019s attitude control jets.\nIf the shroud hadn\u2019t opened fully, they might not be able to dock but that was a secondary objective.\nA failure in the ground support equipment forced them to scrub the Gemini launch for two days.", "The ground crew went through an efficient turnaround and they were ready for the next launch window just three days later.\nLaunch!\nGemini 6 had given them so many problems that it was almost a letdown when it finally launched without a hiccup on December 15, 1965.\nThe rendezvous maneuvers went smoothly and Gemini 6 caught up with Gemini 7 six hours after launch.\nWhen the White Team took over the control room, they had little time to celebrate but the 6 crew certainly found time for a few jokes.", "Do

depending too much on Kranz and pulled him off.\n\u201cKranz had an accident on the way to MCC and is in the hospital,\u201d SimSup told Kraft.\nKranz protested, \u201cWhat are you doing?\nWe have a mission to prepare for!\u201d Kraft was amused.", "The crew for Gemini 9 was Gene Cernan and Tom Stafford.\nCernan was one of the few early astronauts who had served a role other than CapCom in Mission Control.\nHe had been a booster tank monitor for the first four Gemini missions and the controllers easily accepted him into their ranks.\nHe did most of the talking for the 9 crew.\nStafford was the quiet one of the two and generally kept his opinions to himself.\nTheir first launch attempt on May 17, 1966 was a bust when the curse of the Agena struck again and pieces of it fell into the Atlantic Ocean.", "In the meantime, Ed White was preparing for his EVA.\nThis would mean exposing the entire interior of the spacecraft to vacuum.\nThere would be nothing between the astronauts and instant death but their thin space suits and helmets.\nThe team decided to give him an extra orbit to get through his checklist.\nNo one knew what to expect.\nDeke Slayton had told McDivitt that if
