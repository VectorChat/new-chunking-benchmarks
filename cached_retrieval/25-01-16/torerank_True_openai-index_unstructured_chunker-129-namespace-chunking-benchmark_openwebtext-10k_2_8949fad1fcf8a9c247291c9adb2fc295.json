["Aristotle acknowledges that there are three candidates for being called substance, and that all three are substance in some sense or to some degree.\nFirst, there is matter, second, form and third, the composite of form and matter.\nAristotle acknowledges that matter can be a subject of predication and of change, thereby meeting one of the main criteria set up in Categories (1028 b35ff).\nThis suggests an inadequacy or incompleteness in the account in Categories, for there he had seemed to assume that being the subject of predication belonged peculiarly to substance, and also that a subject is an individual of an appropriate kind\u2014what he calls a \u2018this such\u2019: and matter is not an individual, but that from which an individual is made.\nTwo of the criteria of substancehood presented in the Introduction above are: (v) being individuals and kinds of individual; (vi) being stuffs and kinds of stuff.\nAristotle acknowledges that things under (vi)\u2014\u2018natural bodies such as fire and water and everything of that sort(1028 b10\u201311)\u2014are, or are thought to be, substances.\nBut, without seeming to give much argument, he strongly favours (v) over (vi).", "The elimination of matter as a good candidate for being substance, leaves either form alone or the composite of form and matter.\nThe composite seems more consonant with the doctrine of Categories, for the composite is the individual.\nAristotle, however, chooses the form as more paradigmatically substance.\nThis has puzzled some commentators.\nWiggins (1998: 232ff), for example, thinks that the change in doctrine between Categories and Metaphysics is wholly unhelpful.\nThe choice of form as substance causes perplexity because the form seems to be a universal and equivalent to the secondary substance, and so not the most fundamental case of substance.\nBut whether substantial forms are universals in Aristotle is a controversial matter.\nInterpreters disagree about whether the doghood that is in Fido is best regarded as the universal, or as the particular instance of the universal doghood, other dogs exemplifying numerically different instances of the same universal.\n(For example, Lloyd: 1981, Irwin: 1988, Woods: 1991, and Bostock\u2019s commentary to Aristotle 1994.)\nOn this view, the most perspicuous way of regarding the individual substance is not as the composite of form and matter (though this is not wrong) but as the form individualized in the matter.\nThe matter is still an essential component in the substance, but not, so to speak, as an equal partner with the form, but as the catalyst by means of which the form becomes an individual substance.\nIt is clear, however, that if one holds that Aristotle thinks that forms are universals, then forms are not substance, for, in his", "First, consider substratum.\n(i) Ontological basicness.\nThere is a sense in which it is ontologically basic, but it is a rather empty sense: it is the substancehood of everything, without explaining the nature of anything.\n(ii) Durability.\nAgain, it meets the criterion, but in an empty way.\nIt is difficult to see how it could be destroyed (like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter) but it has no positive nature.\n(iii) and (iv) Bearer of predication and subject of change.\nAs with matter for Aristotle, it meets the first of these standards well, but, in so far as it is a component only in atoms, it is not the subject of change.\n(v) and (vi) Kinds of individuals and stuffs.\nAlthough in everything, it is itself no kind of thing and therefore no kind of individual or stuff.\nSubstratum\u2019s claim to substancehood does not rest, however, on meeting the tests itself, but on being what enables particular kinds of substances to be substances.\nAccording to the believer in substratum, it is in virtue of their inhering in a substratum that a collection of properties can constitute an enduring, change-sustaining thing of a certain kind.\nWithout that support, individual instances of properties could, if they could exist at all, be no more than ephemeral events.", "Finally, let us consider how Aristotle fares according to the criteria of substance with which we ended the introduction.\nAristotelian substance, whether construed as individualized form or composite of form and matter meets (i), the criterion of ontological basicness.\nIt also meets (ii), relative durability, although in a rather modest manner.\nIndividual substances are more durable than instances of the properties in the other categories, for it is substances that can take on and lose those other properties.\nIndividuals are not, however, very long-lived and on this criterion Aristotle makes what could be regarded as a concession to Plato, for it is form as universal, which Aristotle does not consider properly substance, which is most durable.\nThere are at least two senses in which substantial forms are eternal.\nFirst, Aristotle believes the world to be eternal and all the same species to exist eternally.\nSo that, even though particular objects are subject to degeneration and decay, the species as such are eternal.\nSecond, generation and decay depend on the material component in composites.\nAny form that does not require matter for its activity will be eternal by nature.\nThis applies to the active intellect, which is an essential feature of all human intellects, and to the immaterial movers of the cosmos described in Metaphysics, Book Lambda.\n(Further consideration of these topics would take us into Aristotle\u2019s philosophy of mind and his theology.)", "There are two main sources for Aristotle\u2019s approach to substance, the Categories and Metaphysics Z.\nThese will be discussed in turn.", "Aristotle analyses substance in terms of form and matter.\nThe form is what kind of thing the object is, and the matter is what it is made of.\nThe term \u2018matteras used by Aristotle is not the name for a particular kind of stuff, nor for some ultimate constituents of bodies, such as atoms (Aristotle rejects atomism).\n\u2018Matteris rather the name for whatever, for a given kind of object, meets a certain role or function, namely that of being that from which the object is constituted.\nRelative to the human body, matter is flesh and blood.\nThe matter of an axehead is the iron from which it is made.\nRelative to the elements, earth, fire, air and water, matter is an intrinsically characterless \u2018prime matterwhich underlies the qualities of them all.", "Reflection on the concept of an object has its first theoretical articulation in Aristotle\u2019s Categories, where he distinguishes between individual objects and the various kinds of properties they can possess.\nHe illustrates the various categories: each [individual term] signifies either substance or quantity or qualification or a relative or where or when or being in a position or having or doing or being affected.\nTo give a rough idea, ideas of substance are man, horse; of quantity: four foot, five foot; of qualification; white, grammatical; of a relative: double, half, larger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when: yesterday, last year; of being in a position: is-lying, is-sitting; of having: has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of being-affected: being-cut, being-burnt.\n(1b25\u20132a4)", "Aristotle\u2019s account in Categories can, with some oversimplification, be expressed as follows.\nThe primary substances are individual objects, and they can be contrasted with everything else\u2014secondary substances and all other predicables\u2014because they are not predicable of or attributable to anything else.\nThus, Fido is a primary substance, and dog\u2014the secondary substance\u2014can be predicated of him.\nFat, brown, and taller than Rover are also predicable of him, but in a rather different way from that in which dog is.\nAristotle distinguishes between two kinds of predicables, namely those which are \u2018said ofobjects and those which are \u2018inobjects.\nThe interpretation of these expressions is, as usually with Aristotelian cruxes, very controversial, but a useful way of looking at it is as follows.\nDog is said of Fido because it characterizes him as a whole.\nFat and the others are described as being in because they pick out a constituent feature that could be said to be, in a logical though not a physical sense, part of, or in him.\nFido the individual is not attributable to any further thing at all.", "attacks on Plato, Aristotle makes it plain that universals are not substance.\nSubstances for Aristotle are individuals, but it is much debated whether they are individualized forms or composites of form and matter.", "The stronger, incompatibilist interpretation is that Aristotle did not believe that the behaviour of complex entities followed from the laws that govern their parts or their matter.\n(Gotthelf 1987, Robinson 1983) By contrast, the behaviour of the matter is influenced by what it is the matter of.\nThe nature of the matter places restrictions on what the enmattered thing can do\u2014an animal can only be made from living tissue, not of stone or fire\u2014but exactly how that matter behaves depends on the substantial form present in it.\nThe substantial form plays, therefore, an essential role, not merely in certain kinds of scientific explanation, but by being a fundamental efficient cause in its own right.\nWhichever of these is the correct interpretation of Aristotle, it was the second which was the core of \u2018Aristotelian scienceas found in scholastic philosophy, and it was this aspect of the Aristotelian doctrine of substance that aroused most opposition amongst seventeenth century philosophers and scientists.\nThey insisted that bodies behave as they do because of the mechanical consequences of the nature of the matter from which they are made: the matter is not \u2018pushed aroundor organized by a substantial form.\nPhilosophers and scientists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries believed that in rejecting such influences they were rejecting the Aristotelian doctrine of substance.", "The Aristotelian tradition anchors the concept of substance, at least in nature, primarily to instances of species of natural object.\nThe Kantian tradition ties it to those enduring bodies the individuation of which gives sense and structure to our spatio-temporal framework.\nDavid Wiggins (1967, 1980, 2001) has made a sustained attempt to prove that these two objectives necessarily go together and to make the Aristotelian notion of substance, even including its bias towards the biological, central to our practice of individuating objects.\nWiggins assumes that individuating a temporally enduring object involves being able to re-identify it at different times and under different descriptions.\nThis assumption makes it possible to state substance individuation using the language of identity.\nWithin the scope of this assumption, he makes two claims.\nThe first is the sortal relativity of identity: that is, when any a and b are asserted to be the same thing, they must be the same something-or-other, and the something-or-other must be the kind of concept that answers \u2018what is it?questions.\nIn other words, there is no such a thing as \u2018bare identity\u2019\u2014identity under no concept at all.\nFurthermore, the relevant concept must be an Aristotelian substance concept or sortal.\nMore formally, this can be expressed as follows:", "As we have seen, substances are the paradigm subjects of predication and change, so (iii) and (iv) are met.\nAs Aristotle\u2019s substances are individual things and kinds of things (v) is met.\nA nod is made in the direction of stuffs and kinds of stuff, but Aristotle does not develop this thought, so (vi) is barely met.\nThere were two major problems that the Aristotelian tradition has faced in the modern period.\nThey are: (1) explaining and justifying the sense in which substantial forms have causal or explanatory power, especially in the light of a developed mechanistic chemistry or physics; (2) the difficulty in understanding the relation of substantial form to properties, especially those in terms of which a given substance is defined.\nThese are connected.\nIt is because the substantial form has genuine causal force that it is conceived of by Aristotle as a unified entity in its own right, and not just as a name for the collocation of properties in terms of which it is defined.\n(One subject that has not been discussed is the connection between the doctrine of substance and teleology.\nAristotle regards this relation as important, but in this entry it will have a section of its own, 3.5 below.)\nThe standard account of the medieval treatment of the topic is that S. Thomas Aquinas is the only important figure and what he says differs little from Aristotle, except for making things more rigid and formal.\nIt is clear, however, that this is a serious oversimplification.\nFor a more nuanced and sophisticated view, see Lagerlund (2012), on which this section draws extensively.", "The division between being said of and being in\u2014that is, between substance concepts and other properties\u2014seems intuitively clear enough until one remembers that substance concepts are complex and are definable in terms of other properties.\nThus, \u2018manis defined as \u2018featherless bipedor \u2018rational animal\u2019, and it would seem that \u2018featherless\u2019, \u2018two-footedor \u2018rationalare properties and hence the kinds of things that are in objects.\nAristotle denies that this is so when they enter into the definition of a substance.\nThe features that specifically make an object the kind of substance that it is, are called differentiae, and Aristotle says the differentia also is not in a subject.\nFor footed and two-footed are said of man as subject, but are not in a subject; neither footed not two-footed is in man.\n(3 a23\u20135)", "substances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our spatio-temporal framework, and the individuation and re-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework.\n(It should be remarked in passing that at least one major expositor of Aristotle (Irwin: 1988, especially chs 1, 9, 10) attributes a very similar intention to Aristotle himself.)\nIn section 3.5 we shall introduce a notion grounded in Aristotle\u2019s account, but which has not naturally found a place in the earlier discussion, namely the connection between substance and teleology.\nThis can be expressed as: The substances in a given system are those entities crucial from the teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucialmeans that other things exist either to constitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.", "Perhaps it is better, therefore, to see Aristotle in Categories not as defining \u2018substance\u2019, so that someone wholly lacking the concept might come to understand it, but as exhibiting the marks and characteristics of a primitive concept on which we have an intuitive grasp.\nIf we understand his project in this way, we can see Aristotle as presenting various marks of substance in Categories.\nThe marks of primary substance are: Being objects of predication but not being themselves predicable of anything else (at least, not in the way entities in the other categories are: see the problem about attribution to location above).\nBeing able to receive contraries.\n(4 a10) A substance can go from being hot to being cold, or from being red to being blue, but the instance of blue in an object cannot similarly take on and lose a wide range of attributes.\nIf substance did not exist it would be impossible for things in any of the other categories to exist.\nThere could be no instances of properties if there were no substances to possess them.\nBut these criteria do not show why \u2018dogis a secondary substance term and \u2018brown thingis not.\nSo we need marks for being a secondary substance, or substance concept.\nOn this he says two things.", "There are at least three serious questions about Aristotle\u2019s substantial forms.\nOne we have already noticed, namely (i) whether such forms are universals or particulars.\nThe others are (ii) what is the relationship between the substantial form and the properties which enter into its definition?\nWe have already noticed this question when discussing Categories.\n(iii) What is the ontological status of such forms?\nThis is connected with the second question, for it is connected with the question of what the substantial form is over and above the properties essential to it.\nWhat I mean by this is as follows.\nLet us agree, for purposes of argument, that human being is a kind of substance and that rationality and animality are the properties in terms of which that substance is defined.\nIt is uncontroversial that these properties are meant to be objective features of the external world.\nBut what is the relation between the substantial form and those properties?\nIs the presence of the substantial form human being nothing more than the presence of those properties, or is the form something further which is, in some sense responsible for the presence of those properties?\nWe saw in the previous section that the differentia in terms of which a substance is defined is not treated as being \u2018inobjects, as other properties are.\nThis seems to suggest that calling an object a substance of a certain sort is not just a way of attributing to it the properties in terms of which it is defined.\nAristotle is undoubtedly a realist about substantial forms, in the sense of thinking them to be", "colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia.\nIn other words, our confidence that these kinds have a genuine real essence is built into the concept.\nIf this is correct, then our ordinary \u2018natural kindconcepts, like water and gold, have built into them intimations of a deeper unity than that supplied by superficial features, even if it be allied to a complete agnosticism about what that unity might consist in or whether we might ever uncover it.", "3.2.2.\nThe concept of substratum or \u2018thin particular\u2019", "The individual substances are the subjects of properties in the various other categories, and they can gain and lose such properties whilst themselves enduring.\nThere is an important distinction pointed out by Aristotle between individual objects and kinds of individual objects.\nThus, for some purposes, discussion of substance is a discussion about individuals, and for other purposes it is a discussion about universal concepts that designate specific kinds of such individuals.\nIn the Categories, this distinction is marked by the terms \u2018primary substanceand \u2018secondary substance\u2019.\nThus Fido the dog is a primary substance\u2014an individual\u2014but dog or doghood is the secondary substance or substantial kind.\nEach arm of this distinction raises different issues.\nIf one is concerned with kinds of substance, one obvious question that will arise is \u2018what makes something a thing of that kind (for example, what is involved in being a dog)?This is the question of the essence of substantial kinds.\nBut if one is concerned with individuals, the parallel question is \u2018what makes something that particular individual of a given kind (for example, what is involved in a dog\u2019s being and remaining Fido)?This is the question of individual essences and of identity over time.\nAristotle was mainly, if not exclusively, concerned with questions of the first kind, but, as we shall see in sections 2.5.2 and 3, the latter question assumed a prominence later.", "2.2.2 Metaphysics", "He considers two objections to his own account which would seem to apply to all independence accounts.\nOne is that it cannot cope with essential properties, for it seems to imply that, for any given property-instance, a substance can exist without it, which is not true of essential properties.\nThe other is that it cannot cope with the necessity of origin for individual identity.\nLowe responds to the former objection by saying that essential properties are identical with the substance, so cannot be cited as something other than substance that meets his criterion for being substance.\nIt is not clear that this will work.\nThe idea that the essence is identical with the substance is Aristotelian, but it is not clear how this applies to essential properties, taken individually.\nWe have already seen, in our discussion of Aristotle, that the relation between the essence as some kind of unity and the properties that seem to constitute it is not clear.\nHe copes with the second by denying that origin is essential to identity.\nUnfortunately, he argues for this position by citing human subjects: Socrates, for example, would still have been who he was even if he had had different parents.\nThis is, of course, controversial about humans, but it is our Cartesian intuitions that make it plausible in that case.\nThat this table, for example, could have been the same object even if made from different material does not have the same plausibility.", "The Categories sets out important logical distinctions between different kinds of attribute, but it does not enter into a metaphysical analysis of substance itself.\nThis takes place mainly in Metaphysics, Book Z.\nIn the latter, the analysis of substances in terms of form and matter is developed, whereas these notions have no place in Categories.\nThe distinction has led some commentators to talk of Aristotle\u2019s \u2018two systems\u2019, containing two radically different conceptions of substance.\n(Graham 1987) In the earlier, Categories, substances are simply individuals; in the later work they are complexes of form and matter.\nWhether this represents a change of view, or whether the purposes of the Categories simply did not require reference to the metaphysical analysis of substance is a moot point.\nIt seems unlikely, however, given Aristotle\u2019s Platonic background, that his early thought was oblivious to the role of form in substance.\nWhichever interpretation of the development of Aristotle\u2019s thought is correct, the introduction of substantial form is what gives the fully developed Aristotelian account of substance.", "The first role will not be necessary if one thinks that there is a \u2018master propertyof which the others are modes, or if one thinks that unity can come from some causal or organizational connection.\n(ii) will not apply to a tropist theory, or if one thinks that location will do the job.\n(iii) rests on the intuition that no collection of properties could, in themselves, amount to a substance: the very idea is a category mistake, and only the presence of a special \u2018substantializingelement could do that.\nIt might be argued that this intuition begs the question against the bundle theory.\nAt the current state of the debate, it looks as if there is no compelling reason for accepting substratum.", "There is a connotation of the word \u2018substance\u2019, reflected in the sense of substantial, which signifies durability or even permanence.\nEvents, or Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are never substantial in this sense, because they are fleeting.\nAtoms, fundamental kinds of stuff, gods, or abstract entities, such as Platonic Forms or numbers, might be considered to be substantial to the point of being indestructible or eternal: they last at least as long as the world exists\u2014and, in the case of gods or God, or abstract entities, perhaps longer.\nIt seems, in summary, that there are at least six overlapping ideas that contribute to the philosophical concept of substance.\nSubstances are typified as: being ontologically basic\u2014substances are the things from which everything else is made or by which it is metaphysically sustained; being, at least compared to other things, relatively independent and durable, and, perhaps, absolutely so; being the paradigm subjects of predication and bearers of properties; being, at least for the more ordinary kinds of substance, the subjects of change; being typified by those things we normally classify as objects, or kinds of objects; being typified by kinds of stuff.", "\u2018It is reasonable that, after the primary substances, their species and genera should be the only other things called (secondary) substance.\nFor only they, of things predicated, reveal the primary substance.(2 b28\u201330) \u2018Of the secondary substances the species is more a substance than the genus, since it is nearer to the primary substance.\nFor if one is to say of the primary substance what it is, it will be more apt to give the species than the genus.(2 b8\u201311)", "we have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of body: the one being supposed to be (without knowing what it is) the substratum to those simple ideas we have from without; and the other supposed (with a like ignorance of what it is) to be the substratum to those operations which we experiment in ourselves within.\n\u2018Tis plain then, that the idea of corporeal substance in matter, is as remote from our conceptions, and apprehensions, as that of spiritual substance, or spirit;\u2026.\n(II 23 v) This argument seems to conflate the notions of substratum as pure logical support with that as minute parts.\nIf he means minute parts, then, though it is true that we do not and, in his view, cannot know in detail what they are, we have a theory, which he endorses, that they are probably minute parts as conceived by the atomists, which means they have primary qualities similar in kind though not in scale to those possessed by macroscopic objects.\nThis gives a coherent, though speculative, conception of material substance.\nOf spiritual substance, we have no similar hypothesis.\nIf, on the other hand, he means pure logical substratum, there is nothing to know, for there is no more to it, in either the material or spiritual case, than its role as substratum.\nHe seems to conflate the ignorance we have of minute parts with the logical emptiness of the idea of pure substratum.", "Many of the pre-socratic philosophers in fact had a concept of substance rather like that above attributed to chemistry: that is, their emphasis was on criterion (vi) above.\nThey thought, that is, that the being of the universe (hence they were pursuing substance in sense (i)) consisted in some kind or kinds of stuff.\nThales, for example, thought that everything was essentially water, and Anaximenes that everything was a form of air.\nFor Anaximander, the \u2018stuffin question was indeterminate, so that it could transmute into the various determinate stuffs such as water, air earth and fire.\nBy contrast, atomists such as Democritus took those determinate particular objects they called \u2018atomsto be the substance of the universe.\nAtoms are objects in our ordinary sense, though they are not our ordinary objects: they are not dogs and cats or tables and chairs.\nThey are the subjects of predication, but they do not change their intrinsic properties.\nClassical atoms are, therefore, strong instances of (i) and (ii), but somewhat deviant cases of (iii) and (v).", "It would be universally agreed by scholars that substantial forms are real in the sense that they play an irreducible and ineliminable explanatory role in the behaviour of the things in which they are the form.\nThere are two interpretations of what Aristotle meant by this, one of which seems compatible with modern science and the other not.\nFirst the compatibilist one.\nEmpiricist philosophers of science used to believe that the concepts in higher order sciences could be reduced, either by means of reductive definition or by \u2018bridging laws\u2019, to those in the more basic sciences.\n(See, for example, Nagel 1961.)\nBy such means, everything could be understood in terms of the most basic science\u2014presumed to be physics.\nConcepts in the other sciences are thus only a kind of shorthand for laborious descriptions in the language of physics.\nFew, if any, philosophers of science believe this now.\nThey agree that, even if the world is \u2018closed under physics\u2019\u2014every event has a complete set of physical causes\u2014the concepts of the other sciences are irreducible and do autonomous explanatory jobs.\nEven if dogs are wholly physical objects and even if all the atoms in dogs follow very precise laws of physics, nevertheless when doing the biology of dogs one will need concepts not to be found in a physics textbook.\nThis is not for mere shorthand convenience, but because of the kinds of things in which, for example, the biologist or veterinary scientist is interested.\nThere are interpreters of Aristotle who think that this kind of irreducibility is all that Aristotle means\u2014or needs to mean\u2014by", "There is nothing over and above the properties of an object corresponding to our substance concepts\u2014nothing, that is, like a substantial form\u2014present in the world.\nSortals are entirely formed by our minds, in the light of the properties perceived to be in the world.\nThe boundaries we draw between kinds of things are, to some degree at least, arbitrary and concept relative.\nI do not deny, but nature, in the constant production of particular beings, makes them\u2026 very much alike and of kin one to another: but I think it nevertheless true, that the boundaries of the species, whereby men sort them, are made by men\u2026.\n(III vi 37: italics in original) The situation in (ii) is greatly aggravated by our ignorance of real essences.\nIf we could know those more accurately, we would know better where to draw the boundaries.\nThe disposition of properties in nature need not have been as it is and might actually contain oddities not corresponding to any of our sortals.\nSortals, unlike Aristotelian species, place no constraints on how individual objects must or ought to be.", "as brown thing, which may or may not characterize something through the whole of its existence.\nBut it is vital that the distinction between sortals, phase or ultimate, and expressions such as brown thing be clearly maintained, if the notion of sortal is to serve any formal purpose.", "The conclusion is striking because it is a denial that a and b might be identical under one form of identification, but not under another.\nIn fact it implies that every individuable object falls under just one ultimate sortal.\n(Wiggins admits this in (2001: 67 n.7).\nWhat is meant by ultimate sortal will emerge below.)\nFor every ultimate sortal has its own principle of individuation, and if an object fell under more than one, there could be a time at which it satisfied the criteria for one and not for the other.\nWiggins\u2019s thesis is a very strong claim, apparently backed up by a powerful argument.\nIt is a strong claim for it purports to prove that any world with individuable objects must be constituted by Aristotelian substances.\nThe argument is powerful because it follows by simple logic, granted seemingly plausible claims about identity, and Leibniz\u2019s Law.", "It would seem that these properties belong to objects in different ways when they are part of a definition from when they are not.\nThe issue is what constitutes the unity of the species or secondary substance: why is it not just a collection of properties and, if it is just such a collection, why is it so different from any other collection of properties?\nIn order to begin to see how Aristotle tackled this problem we need the apparatus of form and matter, which does not appear in the Categories.\n(We will see when discussing contemporary theories in section 3.1, however, that it is not clear that even now can we provide a wholly non-circular account of substance.)", "Almost all major philosophers have discussed the concept of substance and an attempt to cover all of this history would be unwieldy.\nThe selection made will concentrate on those philosophers in whom the broadly analytic tradition has shown most interest.\nFirst we shall look at the development of the concept in the ancient world, culminating in the work of Aristotle.\nHis account dominated debate through the Middle Ages and until the early modern period.\nWe shall consider various rationalist and empiricist treatments of the concept.\nLocke\u2019s contribution will be considered in especial detail because so much contemporary discussion is inspired (as we shall see in section 3) by an Aristotle-Locke nexus.", "A statue and a lump of clay occupy the same place at a given time.\nWhat is their relation to each other?\nThe apparent options are (i) they are identical (ii) they are not identical, but the clay constitutes the statue.\n(i) appears to be ruled out because they have different identity conditions.\n(ii) has seemed to many philosophers to be the natural solution to the problem, but it, too, faces difficulties.\nFirst, it has the intuitive disadvantage that it allocates two solid physical objects to the same place.\nEach of them weighs, say, ten pounds, yet the total of their weight is only ten pounds.\nIt might seem natural to think\u2014and it was formerly a well established maxim\u2014that there can be only one solid physical thing at one place at a given time.\nSomeone impressed by the idea that two bodies cannot be in the same place at the same time might think it more natural to say that there are two different ways of conceptualizing the material presence at that point, than that there are two material things.\nThat way it is easy to see why two ten pound objects need not add up to twenty pounds when put together.", "Our discussion of Aristotle ended by returning to the issue if the unity of substantial form \u2013 what is the difference between a collection of \u2018essentialproperties and the form as a unitary entity.\nVarious aspects of this issue of the unity of substantial form preoccupied medieval philosophers.\nAccording to Aquinas, a substance possessed only one form, and its matter was the essentially characterless prime matter.\nIn other words the informed parts of an object \u2013 in the case of a living creature, its organs, and the various kinds of stuff that constituted it (in the end, quantities of earth fire air and water) did not possess their own forms, but were informed by the overall substantial form.\nOthers disagreed.\nSome of the disagreements were internal to the hylomorphic system.\nDuns Scotus, for example, argued that a dead person\u2019s body was the same body as had existed when that person was alive.\nThe soul had departed, so the form which was the immortal soul could not be identical with the form of the body.\nThis argument may seem to be specialized to the case of the human immortal soul, but, presumably, a similar problem applies to a dead parrot: it has lost its perceptive and vegetative souls, yet is the same body \u2013 even if it is no longer a parrot.", "Two major areas of controversy require attention.\nFirst, there are the issues concerning how to characterize substance in contradistinction to properties and the other categories.\nThere are at least two major questions here.\nOne concerns defining the notion of substance.\nIn particular, there has been much debate about whether substance can be accounted for in terms of its special kind of independence.\nThe other is whether substancehood require some extra component beyond properties, (and, if so, what?)\nor whether a \u2018bundle of propertiestheory of substance is adequate.\nSecond there is the relation between substances and our practices of individuation and reidentification.\nIn particular, we shall look at the issue of whether objects must be individuated under the kind of sortal expressions that correspond to Aristotelian substance concepts, or whether a more generic notion, such as physical body, will suffice.\nThis latter concern will lead on to a consideration of the connection between substance and teleology.\nOne natural response to the question of what distinguishes substances from properties is that properties depend for their existence on substances, for they are properties of objects (that is, of individual substances), but that substances do not similarly depend on properties for their existence.\nThe point cannot be made quite so simply, however.\nProperties could not exist without objects to be properties of, but neither could substances exist without properties, so the dependence appears to be mutual.", "There could be said to be two rather different ways of characterizing the philosophical concept of substance.\nThe first is the more generic.\nThe philosophical term \u2018substancecorresponds to the Greek ousia, which means \u2018being\u2019, transmitted via the Latin substantia, which means \u2018something that stands under or grounds things\u2019.\nAccording to the generic sense, therefore, the substances in a given philosophical system are those things which, according to that system, are the foundational or fundamental entities of reality.\nThus, for an atomist, atoms are the substances, for they are the basic things from which everything is constructed.\nIn David Hume\u2019s system, impressions and ideas are the substances, for the same reason.\nIn a slightly different way, Forms are Plato\u2019s substances, for everything derives its existence from Forms.\nIn this sense of \u2018substanceany realist philosophical system acknowledges the existence of substances.\nProbably the only theories which do not would be those forms of logical positivism or pragmatism which treat ontology as a matter of convention.\nAccording to such theories, there are no real facts about what is ontologically basic, and so nothing is objectively substance.", "For God, so to speak, turns on all sides and considers in all ways the general system of phenomena which he has found it good to produce\u2026And he considers all the faces of the world in all possible ways\u2026the result of each view of the universe, as looked at from a certain position, is\u2026a substance which expresses the universe in conformity with that view.\n(1998: 66)", "it is clear that created substances depend on God, who conserves them and indeed who produces them continuously by a kind of emanation, just as we produce our thoughts.\n(1998: 66) The analogy with thought hardly emphasizes the independence of substance!\nNevertheless, created substances do constitute the created world, and do, in that sense, meet criterion (i) for being substance.\nThey are also the subjects of predication, so they meet criterion (iii).\nLeibniz\u2019s substances, however, are the bearers of change (criterion (iv)) in a very different way from Aristotle\u2019s individual substances.\nAn Aristotelian individual possesses some properties essentially and some accidentally.\nThe accidental properties of an object are ones that can be gained and lost over time, and which it might never have possessed at all: its essential properties are the only ones it had to possess and which it possesses throughout its existence.\nThe situation is different for Leibniz\u2019s monads\u2014which is the name he gives to individual substances, created or uncreated (so God is a monad).\nWhereas, for Aristotle, the properties that an object has to possess and those that it possesses throughout its existence coincide, they do not do so for Leibniz.\nThat is, for Leibniz, even the properties that an object possesses only for a part of its existence are essential to it.\nEvery monad bears each of its properties as part of its nature, so if it were to have been different in any respect, it would have been a different entity.", "We have seen that Locke\u2019s particular substances are kinds of things, and because they are kinds they correspond to Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.\nBut we have also seen that the boundaries between these kinds are largely a matter of convention, which is not true of Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.\nIn so far as their individuation is dependent on human convention, they are not ultimately real in their own right.\nBut though they are not real as kinds, the individual parcels of matter that we classify in these ways are perfectly real.\nLocke does not, as far as I can see, refer to these individuals as \u2018substances\u2019.\nSubstances, considered as kinds, or instances of kinds, can sustain change\u2014living things, for example, change in size throughout their lives.\nMost individual parcels of matter, however, become different individuals if they change any of their parts; although we have seen that this does not apply to living things, where there seems to be a metaphysical component called sameness of life.", "3.3.2 The \u2018isof constitution", "This association of substance with kinds carries over into a use of the term which is perhaps more scientific, especially chemical, than philosophical.\nThis is the conception according to which substances are kinds of stuff.\nThey are not individual objects nor kinds of individual object.\nExamples of this usage are water, hydrogen, copper, granite or ectoplasm.", "According to Locke, we have two conceptions of substance.\nOne is a \u2018notion of pure substance in general(Essay II xxiii 2), the other \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substance(II xxiii 3).\nBoth these conceptions of substance provide difficulties of interpretation.\nThey also both relate to issues in contemporary philosophy of substance, in which Locke\u2019s influence is almost as important as Aristotle\u2019s.\n2.5.1 Locke on \u2018pure substance in generalLocke expresses this idea as follows:", "As Mackie (2000) points out, the full statement of this theory involves various relatively ad hoc restrictions.\nMore importantly, it does not seem to explain what unifies the category of substance, for it does not say that it is true of any substance that it could conceivably be the only substance existing for a period of time\u2014indeed, it could not apply to non-atomic substances, for complex ones can exist only if other substances\u2014those that constitute their parts\u2014also exist.\nIt implies only that something from the category of substance might so exist and that this could not be true of any other category.\nOne might wonder what enabled substances that could not exist alone to count as substances at all.\nIf either of the above accounts are successful, substances, properties and events are distinguished.\nThe question remains, however, how far these are nominal and how far real distinctions.\nThat there is a difference between substance concepts and property concepts has definitely been shown, but does it follow that there are, in reality two different kinds of thing, namely properties and substances?\nThe answer might seem to be obvious.\nGiven that there are substance concepts, if those concepts are instantiated, then there are substances in reality.\nCat, table, human being, are substance concepts by the above accounts, and there are cats, tables and humans, so there are substances in reality as well as properties.", "That being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in one coherent body, partaking of one common life, it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life, though that life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant\u2026.\n(Essay II.27.4) One might wonder what this \u2018common lifeis supposed to be, especially in the light of his rejection of Aristotelian \u2018substantial forms\u2019.\nFurthermore, it is tempting to argue that all coherent, solid bodies\u2014such as a lump of rock or plasticene\u2014have some principle of organization which persists through change.\nLiving objects are simply the most dramatic case of this.\n(Though Peter van Inwagen (1990) defends the view that only living things and atoms are real entities: inanimate complex bodies are not true individuals.)\nNevertheless, though the appeal to \u2018lifeseems to modify Locke\u2019s conventionalism, it still leaves open the possibility that the divisions we make between different species are conventions, because, though we can recognize life (or a \u2018continuing principle of organization\u2019) itself, it is still relatively arbitrary and concept-dependent where life (or \u2018principle of organization\u2019) of one kind ends and another starts.\nSo our division of things into species, though grounded in real continuities in the way that our non-biological (or non-natural) concepts are not, is still nominal.", "3.2.1 Bundle theories and their problems We have just noted that there could be analytically reductionist or de facto reductionist accounts of substance in terms of properties.\nIt is also the case that the properties might be conceived of as universals, or as individuals\u2014that is, property-instances, which are sometimes called \u2018tropes\u2019.\nThere are, therefore, four options for the bundle theorist.", "Many of the concepts analysed by philosophers have their origin in ordinary\u2014or at least extra-philosophical\u2014language.\nPerception, knowledge, causation, and mind would be examples of this.\nBut the concept of substance is essentially a philosophical term of art.\nIts uses in ordinary language tend to derive, often in a rather distorted way, from the philosophical senses.\n(Such expressions as \u2018a person of substanceor \u2018a substantial reasonwould be cases of this.\n\u2018Illegal substancesis nearer to one of the philosophical uses, but not the main one.)\nThere is an ordinary concept in play when philosophers discuss \u2018substance\u2019, and this, as we shall see, is the concept of object, or thing when this is contrasted with properties or events.\nBut such \u2018individual substancesare never termed \u2018substancesoutside philosophy.", "The concept of substance can be analysed in terms of some relation between properties conceived as universals.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of properties conceived of as individuals, e.g., as property-instances or tropes.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as universals.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as individuals.", "such as charm, energy, spin and mass\u2014is not easy to judge.", "Substantive theories take the thought of a further component seriously, and, though they do not seem to be generally distinguished, there are two main conceptions of this extra element, which I will call the \u2018thin particularand the \u2018substratumconceptions.\n\u2018Thin particularis an expression of D. M. Armstrong\u2019s.\nIt is the particular in abstraction from its properties.\nWhen considered with its properties it is a thick particular.\nThe important point is that thin particulars really are particulars.\n\u2018Bertrand Russell might have been a fried egg\u2019: that is, the thin particular associated with one set of properties and, hence, with one thing, might have belonged to another.\nDifferent properties might have been hung on this hook.\nIt is not so clear, by contrast, that a substratum of the kind Locke considers, or like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter, is a particular in this sense.\nIt is more like a kind of stuff\u2014the substantiveness on to which properties are stuck.\nOn this conception, the suggestion that the \u2018pieceof substratum or \u2018prime matterthat is here in object a, might always instead have been there in object b, seems to lack content.\nIt is useful at this point to take note of the three different functions the thin particular or substratum might fulfil.\nIts role might be (i) to bind the properties into a unity, so that they do not \u2018fall apart\u2019: (ii) to individualize them, if they are universals: (iii) to carry one across the categorial barrier from property to substance; that is, to be what it is that makes something to be in the category of substance.", "postulating an explanatory role for substantial form.\nHis theory is at least neutral on the question of whether there is a closed system at the level of basic physics.\n(Nussbaum 1978, 1984)", "Since about the mid 1990s there has developed a debate covering similar territory to that disputed by Wiggins and Ayers, but having rather different roots.\nIt claims to be a revival of a broadly Aristotelian hylomorphism, but it comes mainly from disputes in mereology.", "Various problems can be raised for this account.\nThe most obvious is that it does not, as stated, distinguish between substances and events.\nSome property-instances belong to events rather than substances.\nThe performance of a symphony, for example, is an event, and it may possess the property, in one of its movements, of being allegro.\nIt seems plausible that this particular case of something\u2019s being allegro could not have been exemplified by another performance, but the performance might go on to be andante in another movement, so the event can continue to exist without that original property.\nThe assimilation of events with substances in this way seems strained, however.\nIt does not seem natural to say that the same event was first allegro, then andante, because it is more natural to attribute the different properties to different parts of the event, which are themselves events (in this case, movements).\nThis brings out a major difference between substances and events, namely that the temporal parts of events are themselves events in their own right, but the temporal parts of objects\u2014meaning by that expression the temporal phases of an object\u2019s existence\u2014are not themselves objects.\nIndeed, it is not natural to talk of the temporal parts of objects, though some philosophers (led by David Lewis (1986), but see also Sider (2001), Hawley (2001) and the entry on temporal parts) think that there are compelling philosophical reasons for doing so.\nThe rationale implicit in our ordinary concept is that an object is wholly present at all the temporal points of its existence.\nI say", "3.3.1 The discipline of sortal identification", "The second use of the concept is more specific.\nAccording to this, substances are a particular kind of basic entity, and some philosophical theories acknowledge them and others do not.\nOn this use, Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are not substances, even though they are the building blocks of\u2014what constitutes \u2018beingfor\u2014his world.\nAccording to this usage, it is a live issue whether the fundamental entities are substances or something else, such as events, or properties located at space-times.\nThis conception of substance derives from the intuitive notion of individual thing or object, which contrast mainly with properties and events.\nThe issue is how we are to understand the notion of an object, and whether, in the light of the correct understanding, it remains a basic notion, or one that must be characterized in more fundamental terms.\nWhether, for example, an object can be thought of as nothing more than a bundle of properties, or a series of events.", "The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of those qualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist, sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia, which, according to the true import of the word, is in plain English, standing under or upholding.\n(II xxiii 2) The traditional rationale of Locke\u2019s doctrine of \u2018substance in generalis as follows.\nProperties\u2014or, in Locke\u2019s terms qualities\u2014must belong to something\u2014\u2018cannot subsist\u2026without something to support them\u2019.\nOf course, they belong to objects, but what are objects over and above their properties?\nThe special category of substantial form, as found in Aristotle, is rejected.\nAll that seems to be left is a bare \u2018something\u2019, which on pain of regress, has no properties in its own right, except the property of being the owner or support of other properties.", "The ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2014called sortals\u2014are formed by collecting such combinations of simple ideas, as are by experience and observation of men\u2019s senses, taken notice of to exist together, and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance.\nThus we come to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water, etc\u2026 (II xxiii 3)", "So each monad reflects the whole system, but with its own perspective emphasised.\nIf a monad is at place p at time t, it will contain all the features of the universe at all times, but with those relating to its own time and place most vividly, and others fading out roughly in accordance with temporal and spatial distance.\nBecause there is a continuum of perspectives on reality, there is an infinite number of these substances.\nNevertheless, there is internal change in the monads, because the respect in which its content is vivid varies with time and with action.\nIndeed, the passage of time just is the change in which of the monad\u2019s contents are most vivid.\nIt is not possible to investigate here Leibniz\u2019s reasons for these apparently very strange views.\nOur present concern is with whether, and in what sense, Leibniz\u2019s substances are subjects of change.\nOne can say that, in so far as, at all times, they reflect the whole of reality, then they do not change.\nBut in so far as they reflect some parts of that reality more vividly than others, depending on their position in space and time, they can be said to change.", "In the Kantian philosophy of P. F. Strawson (1959, 1966), this framework of necessity is taken in a more common-sense and realist spirit.\nThe world must possess such enduring objects for it to be intelligible for us\u2014indeed, for us to be part of it, for we are essentially stable bodies amongst other stable bodies.\nThe important point for both Strawson and Kant is that there must be substances for there to be a coherent empirical, spatio-temporal world.\nSubstance has become a formal concept of central importance\u2014that is a concept with a special central role in the structure of our conceptual scheme\u2014rather than being the name for certain kinds of important things in the world.\nThis distinction, however, is one that has to be handled carefully, especially within a realist Kantian framework, such as Strawson provides.\nThis should become clear below when we discuss Wiggins\u2019s theory, which is both Aristotelian and Strawsonian.\nNevertheless, it gives ground for adding the seventh of the marks of substance mentioned in the Introduction, namely that substances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our spatio-temporal framework and individuation and re-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework.", "It is clear that this way of thinking paves the way for atomism and its associated problems as they emerged in early modern philosophy.", "All these issues are very controversial, and different philosophers have different intuitions.\n(See, for example, Rea 1997.)\nBut, if one were to conclude that the statue and the lump are neither identical nor stand in the constitution relation, what else could one say?\nOne strategy is to take the notion of body or material object as basic.\nIn the next section, this possibility is compared with other options.", "The matter is not so simple, however.\nIt is possible, and not uncommon, for concepts of a certain kind to be exemplified, but for it to be the case that, nevertheless, entities answering directly to those concepts are not included in the most economical statement of one\u2019s ontology.\nThis is reductionism, and it can operate in either of two ways, namely either analytical reductionism or what one might call de facto or \u2018nothing butreductionism.\nIn the present case, it would conform to the analytical option if the concept of substance could be analysed in terms of properties or events (e.g., \u2018to be a substance =df to be a collection of properties bound together in way W\u2019).\nBut one might still hold that, though the concept of substance is not precisely analysable and is indispensible, substances in fact are nothing but collections of properties.\nThis latter is the de facto option.\nSo the existence of substances does not show that the concept is important from a philosophical perspective, or, if it has some significance, whether this is just as a necessary part of our conceptual scheme, or as an ineliminable feature of reality itself.", "3.3.3 A possible reconciliation of Wiggins and Ayers.", "How might we choose between sortalism and somatism?\nThe dispute between them can seem difficult to pin down.\nPerhaps an irenic compromise is possible.\nMetaphysically, this compromise favours the somatist, but seems to give the sortalist everything he should want.\nThe principle of the compromise is that Wiggins\u2019s formal argument is correct: and hence it is necessarily true that Relative Identity is not possible.\nBut it is only a contingent truth that the terms that can substitute for F in his formal proof are generally\u2014but not always\u2014sortals of an Aristotelian kind.\nAnything can be substituted for F which picks the object out as a unified body.", "The statue and the lump of clay are dealt with by denying that the lump and the statue are identical: the lump of clay constitutes the statue, but is not identical with it.\nNotice that he could have argued that the statue was just a phase of the

this section, defends an \u2018independenceaccount of substance, which he states in terms of identity, as follows: x is a substance if and only if x is a particular and there is no particular y such that y is not identical to x and the identity of x depends on the identity of y.", "This account is intuitive, but perhaps it cannot be treated as a formally adequate definition of the notion of primary substance or individual.\nFido the individual could be said to be in a certain location and so attributed to something, namely a place.\nIt is natural to reply to this that an object is not an attribute of a place in the same way as a property is an attribute of a thing: the property is in a thing \u2018as a subject\u2019, but a place is not a subject to which a thing is attributed: the place does not \u2018underliethe thing as a thing \u2018underliesits properties.\nAlthough this may be true, it presupposes that we already have a grasp on the sense in which properties belong to objects and how this differs from the various ways that objects belong to or can be attributed to things, and that we can call upon this informal understanding in interpreting the theoretical account.\nWhether this is legitimate might depend on what the objective was.\nIf the objective were to explain the difference between substance and property in an entirely non-circular way by appealing to the fact that properties are in substances but substances are not in things, this would involve taking the notion of being in as primitive.\nIf we have to distinguish the sense in which properties are in substances from the way in which substances can be in things\u2014such as places\u2014before we can make the original point, then there has not been a non-circular account.\nIf, on the other hand, the objective is simply to differentiate between concepts already in play, then Categories achieves its objective.", "Plato rejected these materialist attempts to explain everything on the basis of that of which it was made.\nAccording to Plato, the governing principles were the intelligible Forms which material objects attempted to copy.\nThese Forms are not substances in the sense of being either the stuff or the individuals or the kinds of individuals out of which all else is constructed.\nRather they are the driving principles which give structure and purpose to everything else.\nIn itself, the rest would be, at most, an unintelligible chaos.\nThe Forms meet criterion (i)\u2014ontological basicness\u2014but in a slightly eccentric way, because they do not, in a normal sense, constitute things.\nThey meet (ii)\u2014durability\u2014in a strong fashion, for they are eternal.\nThey are not, in the intended senses, the subjects of predication, and in no sense the subjects of change, so they do badly on (iii) and (iv).\nThey do not do well on (v) for they are not individual things in any normal sense, though they are individuals, of a very unusual kind.\n(Aristotle\u2019s main criticism of Plato\u2019s Forms was that they are a bastard confusion of universal and particular.\nSee Fine (1993).)\nThey are in no way kinds of stuff, hence failing

Rosenkrantz (1994 and 1997) develop a different, though probably not incompatible, conception of the relative independence of substances compared to other categories.\nSubstance, they say, is the only category of thing which might have only one instance through at least a minimally extended period of time.\nThus, for example, there is no possible world which has, in a given period of time, only one event, for any non-instantaneous event will be made of events which are its parts.\nSimilarly for properties or tropes, there can never be only one because any one entails the existence of others, as, for example, the existence of a red property (instance) entails the existence of (an instance of) the property colour.\nBy contrast, there could exist through a period of time just one substance,

later that the Kantian tradition adds a seventh mark of substance:", "In fact there are three issues concerning the material underpinning of things which Locke regards as mysterious, and he seems to move indifferently from one to the other.\nFirst, there is organization of the minute parts of particular kinds of objects, which is responsible for the manifest properties of those objects, and which he thinks will always fall beyond our knowledge.\nSecond is the mystery of what holds the minute parts together: the problem of explaining attraction in a system that only understands influence by impact.\n(xxiii 23).\nThird, is that idea of substance as a bare substratum, which is \u201ca supposed, I know not what, to support those ideas we call accidents.\u201d (xxiii 15).", "The concept of substance figures centrally in a positive way for the rationalist philosophers, in a way that it does not for the empiricists.\nThe rationalistssubstances are not, however, the individual objects of everyday life.\nDescartes believed in only two kinds of substance: material body, which is defined by extension, and mental substance, which is defined by thought, which, in this context, is more or less equivalent to consciousness.\nDescartes (like Aristotle and unlike most of his contemporaries and immediate successors) was not an atomist.\nHe did not believe in a void between bodies, so there is a sense in which there is just one material substance, numerically as well as specifically.\nFor Descartes, therefore, material substance falls more naturally into the stuff category, rather than into the thing category.\nThe situation is different for mental substance.\nThe cogito shows that Descartes definitely believes that each person is a different individual mental substance.\nDescartes, like the atomists, believed that matter operates in an entirely mechanical way.\nThere is, therefore, no causal role for substantial form to play and, hence, no need for such forms.\nHis two substances are each defined in terms of one property (extension for matter and thought for mind), hence there is no problem about the relation between substance and the properties in terms of which it is defined.\nAs he does not have substances as individuals made of kinds of stuff, there is no conflict between individuals and stuffs.", "This problem can be overcome by more careful expression of the point, making it clear that we are not talking about properties in general and substances in general, but about particular instances or cases of a property and the particular objects to which they belong.\nA particular property instance cannot exist and could not have existed without the substance of which it is a property, but the particular substance can exist and could have existed without that property instance.\nThus, a particular instance of colour cannot exist, and could not have existed, without the object of which it is the colour, but the object can exist without the colour instance, for it may change colour and remain the same object, or it could have had a different colour from the start.", "Another possible line is that a swordstick is not one object, but two objects that share some of their matter.\nThis introduces a category of what one might call Siamese objects.\nIt can be argued, however, that allowing this kind of entity undermines Wiggins\u2019s opposition to those, like Ayers, who think that the concept for reidentifying objects is, or often is, something more generic than sortal concepts; something akin to material body.\nTo see how this may come about, we must consider the rationale for Ayers\u2019s theory.\nThe fact that sortals do not seem to follow the discipline that Wiggins wishes for them might be taken to support the view that substances can be individuated under much more generic notions, such as same body or same material thing.\n(Ayers 1991a).\nOn this view, material cohesion is what picks out paradigmatic physical things.\nWiggins regards these ideas as too generic to be adequate on their own.\nSuch a concept cannot be", "2.2.1 Categories", "This line of thought proved to be a slippery slope, and, as so often, the downward slide was led by William of Ockham.\nOn the one hand, Ockham was committed to hylomorphism, in that a substance is composed of form and matter.\nBut he reverses the priorities of Aquinas and Scotus by saying that the parts are actual in their own right and do not derive their actuality from the whole: rather, the whole is nothing but the sum of its parts.\nThis line of thought opened the way to atomism and to treating the unity of wholes as a matter of convention or degree.\nBuridan, who represents a further development in this direction, says", "In general, Locke\u2019s particular substances are not ontologically basic, because their essences are nominal, though this is not so clearly true for sortals naming biological kinds.\nLocke\u2019s conceptualism about such substances makes most of the tests irrelevant, which are cast within a realist framework.\nLocke\u2019s \u2018particular substancesare kinds which are individuated conventionally, and so are not real substantial kinds, by Aristotelian standards.\nBut Locke is not without substance other than substratum, for his real essence\u2014that is, the atoms and their structures\u2014are his real substances, and what we say above about the substantiality of atoms also goes for Locke.", "Different philosophers emphasize different criteria from amongst this list, for reasons connected with their system as a whole.\nOne could plausibly say that an account is intuitively more appealing, the more of the criteria it can find a place for.\nProbably, the Aristotelian tradition comes nearest to doing this.",

\u2018more\u2019?\nThis question can be given a deflationary or a substantive answer.\nThe deflationary answer is that a substance is a thing which has properties, and that is all one needs to say.\n(See, for example, Crane and Farkas 2004, 143f, and Chisholm 1969.)\nAn object is not composed of properties and some further ingredient\u2014the \u2018thingybit\u2014an object is something which simply has properties.\nAny feature of it can, of course, be regarded as a property, but that does not render an object nothing but a collection of properties.\nThere seems to be a clash of intuitions at this point about what makes sense.\nAn opponent of the deflationary view will say that properties, however understood, must be components of objects, conceptually or formally speaking.\nIf they are not the only components in this sense, one must say something about the nature of the rest.\nThe deflationist thinks that this line of thought embodies some kind of category mistake in the way it handles the idea of a component.\nThe anti-deflationist will argue that the fact that we are talking about components only in a conceptual sense does not alter the fact that we are obliged, once we start, to offer an account that is complete and distinguishes the various elements.", "Thus, for Locke, the real essence is an unknown atomic constitution.\nThe types that we categorize them in depend on the properties we happen to be able to perceive and kinds or sorts are defined in terms of these observable properties.\nDefinition in these terms he calls \u2018nominal essence\u2019.\nOur concepts of natural substances presuppose that the nominal essence hides a real essence\u2014that is, that all water, gold, horses etc are in some way similar at a microscopic level.\nBut he both denies that these real essences play any role in the formation of our concepts and is deeply sceptical of our ever being able to discover what they are.\nHis attitude towards the Aristotelian view is expressed later in the paragraph just quoted: \u2026a philosopher\u2026whatever substantial forms he may talk of, has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are found in them\u2026.", "Furthermore, there is a sense in which all monads are exactly similar to each other, for they all reflect the whole world.\nThey each do so, however, from a different perspective.", "The difference between substances, events and properties can now be expressed as follows.\nSubstances and events are distinguished from properties by the fact that properties are the kinds of things the instances of which depend for their existence on the particular substance or event by which they are instantiated, whereas substances and events are such as not to depend for their existence on particular instances of properties.\nAnd substances are distinguished from events in the following way: events are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are temporally composed of further things of the same category (i.e., events): substances are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are not temporally composed of things of the same category (i.e., of substances) but endure singly through the period.", "Second, the language of constitution is more natural if the situation is described in some ways rather than others.\nIt is natural to say that the statue is made of clay or even from a piece of clay.\nBut suppose one characterizes the clay more exactly, in terms of the particular atoms in a particular arrangement.\nStrictly, on modal grounds, this structured collection and the statue are different.\nThe statue could have been made of a collection of atoms with at least some different members, but the entity defined as containing just those atoms could not.\nThis entity\u2014atoms A 1 \u2026A n in given spatial arrangement S\u2014is not a very natural kind of object, but it is a real body, in a way that something arbitrarily composed of, for example, half of this table and two toes from President Bush\u2019s left foot is not.\nThis collection of atoms in this structure is what investigation would show to be really there.\nThough it is natural to say that the statue is constituted by the atoms, it is less natural to say that the atoms and the structure taken together, are what it is made from: rather it might seem natural to say that that is what it is.\nTo use the Aristotelian terminology, there is strong pressure to say that atoms and structure together are matter and form, and hence are the complete individual.", "In this sense, I am not the same as I was yesterday, because something was part of my integrity yesterday, which has already been used up, and something was not part of my integrity, which has meanwhile been added by nourishment.\n(Buridan, Physics I,q.10, f. xiii: cited Lagerlund, 476)", "The ontological status of complex bodies and \u2018masses of matter(in Locke\u2019s phrase) is an issue very much under dispute and we shall return to it below.", "For any identifiable and re-identifiable object, there must be some predicate F which applies to it in a present-tense manner through the whole of its existence, and which, by its meaning, picks the object out as a unified physical whole.\nAll natural ultimate sortals designate unified physical bodies in the manner prescribed in (1), and so are very suitable as substitutions for F. It is logically possible, however, that this might not have been so (there might logically have been natural sortals that worked like swordstick), but that they do follow this model, and are not like swordstick, is a pretty deep fact about our world and about any world with similar laws of nature to those that hold in our world.\nArtifactual sortals generally designate distinct, unified bodies (as do \u2018swordand \u2018walking stickin the ordinary cases), though exceptions ( as in the case of the swordstick considered above) are more common and less fantastic than in the natural cases.\nThere are acceptable substitutions for F which would not normally be classified as sortals, but using concepts such as piece, or hunk or lump of stuff.\nIn at least some of these cases, there is no sortal available.\n\u2018[Unified] bodycould always do the job of F, because other, more specific, terms work just because the things they designate are unified bodies.\nOn its own, \u2018same bodyis just not very explanatory.", "This solution, as Bennett recognizes, makes substancehood a function of how we operate on the properties we perceive.\nIt is, in that sense, more Kantian than realist.\nAs what it recognizes as out there in the world is just a bundle of properties, it does not dissolve the problem in the way that a deflationist would require.", "The main objections to the \u2018universalsform of the theory rest on its apparent commitment to the Identity of Indiscernibles, for if an object is no more than a bundle of properties, then if a and b have exactly the same properties, they are the same bundle.\nWhether it does carry this commitment may depend on whether one allows spatial points as particulars, in addition to the properties that are universal.\nIf one did, then the universal theories would not entail the identity of indiscernibles, for the same universals could be in two bundles by being at two different locations.", "As we shall see, the idea that there is a real unity which is passed on through the life of an object or through any principle of organization is something that Hume criticizes and rejects.", "2.5.2 Locke on \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2019", "Take Wiggins\u2019s formula, a = F b, where it is assumed that the F is a material object (not God or a spirit etc).\nThe following theses might plausibly be maintained.", "If properties are conceived of as individuals\u2014otherwise known as tropes, property-instances or individualized forms\u2014then there cannot be a problem about the distinctness of exactly similar bundles, for the difference is built into the identity of the elements of the bundle, as it is not if the bundle is made of universals.\nThe problem for this version of the bundle theory seems to be that it is difficult to individuate or distinguish tropes in a way that makes them suitable to be individuals\u2014in one sense, the substances\u2014from which objects are made.\n(Armstrong 1989, 115ff) For example, if an object has a size, a mass, and a motion, are the size and the mass different tropes and is it not strange to think of the size alone as a genuine particular suited to be treated as an \u2018atomiccomponent of the whole?\nOne way out of this problem may be to resort to the notion of a master property which was invoked in the discussion of Locke on substratum (2.5.1); that is, to the notion of one property of which all the others are modes, as visual shape is a mode of colour, or extension is the master property of matter for Descartes.\nIn the Newtonian model, solidity might fill this role, for shape is merely the outline of the solidity which constitutes the heart of the object.\nIn a sense, theories of this kind are not ordinary bundle theories, for one property is chosen to fill the role of substratum, because the other properties inhere in, or are modes of, it.\nWhether anything could perform this role from amongst the properties that are basic to modern, post-Newtonian physics\u2014properties", "Bennett offers one way out of the need to postulate a mysterious substratum.", "When I say \u2018This is an orangeI mean that there are here instances of certain properties such as orangeness, sphericality etc., and I indicate that I am operating on my ideas of those instances in a certain combining manner.\n(1987: 202.\nItalics added.)", "Thus Hume\u2019s treatment of substance is like his treatment of causation, in that he sees both as the projection onto the world of a tendency of our minds either to pass from one thing to another or to associate them in some way.\nHe either doubts that there are such things as substance or causation (scepticism) or even positively denies that there are (nihilism).\nOut of Hume\u2019s very forthright negative attitude there developed two more subtle variants.\nOne of these variants is in the empiricist tradition.\nThat tradition modified Hume\u2019s approach by developing it into a form of reductionism.\nThe experiences which gave rise, through habit, to the mistaken belief (in, for example, substance or causation) are presented as what the belief really affirms.\nThat is, the empirical basis for what Hume deems to be an illusion, is reinterpreted as the reductive account of the concept.\nCausation then becomes constant conjunction, or substance a name for a bundle of properties organized in a certain way or the continuing of the possibility of certain sensations.", "If a = b then (a) there is a sortal F such that: a is an F b is an F a is the same F as b.\nThe second claim is that is that if the object picked out by \u2018aalso falls under another sortal, G, then so will the object picked out by \u2018b\u2019, and it will be the same G as a.\nThis is represented as an application of Leibniz\u2019s Law, for if a is the-same-G-as-a (as it must be) then, as a = b, b must be the-same-G-as-a.\n(b) for any sortal G, a is G iff b is G, if a is G then b is the same G as a."]
