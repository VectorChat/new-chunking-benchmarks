["It is plausible to maintain the general thesis that there are many issues on which Hume was a sceptic or nihilist, but where his legacy is more reductionist than sceptical or nihilist.\nThis general thesis can be explained and illustrated by considering his treatment of substance, for it is a case in question.\nAccording to Hume, in the Treatise, our belief in substance is the result of a mistake or illusion.", "(1978: 220) Hume\u2019s target is any account that postulates a unifying \u2018somethingthat underlies change, whether this be a characterless substratum, a substantial form or (though this is not explicitly mentioned) something like the \u2018continuing lifethat Locke sees as passed on in living things.\nThe crucial point is that a succession of very similar things does not constitute the real continuation of anything, only the illusion of real continuation.\nThus Hume\u2019s treatment of substance is like his treatment of causation, in that he sees both as the projection onto the world of a tendency of our minds either to pass from one thing to another or to associate them in some way.", "The consequence of this is the possibility of bringing together real essence and the sortal concepts originally picked out by a nominal essence.\nWe now know water to be H2O and iron to be the element of atomic weight 56.\nOur substance concepts were, often at least, tracking real essences in the world.", "He either doubts that there are such things as substance or causation (scepticism) or even positively denies that there are (nihilism).\nOut of Hume\u2019s very forthright negative attitude there developed two more subtle variants.\nOne of these variants is in the empiricist tradition.\nThat tradition modified Hume\u2019s approach by developing it into a form of reductionism.\nThe experiences which gave rise, through habit, to the mistaken belief (in, for example, substance or causation) are presented as what the belief really affirms.\nThat is, the empirical basis for what Hume deems to be an illusion, is reinterpreted as the reductive account of the concept.", "This assumption makes it possible to state substance individuation using the language of identity.\nWithin the scope of this assumption, he makes two claims.\nThe first is the sortal relativity of identity: that is, when any a and b are asserted to be the same thing, they must be the same something-or-other, and the something-or-other must be the kind of concept that answers \u2018what is it?questions.\nIn other words, there is no such a thing as \u2018bare identity\u2019\u2014identity under no concept at all.\nFurthermore, the relevant concept must be an Aristotelian substance concept or sortal.", "First published Sun Oct 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Nov 16, 2018 The second use of the concept is more specific.\nAccording to this, substances are a particular kind of basic entity, and some philosophical theories acknowledge them and others do not.\nOn this use, Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are not substances, even though they are the building blocks of\u2014what constitutes \u2018beingfor\u2014his world.", "In David Hume\u2019s system, impressions and ideas are the substances, for the same reason.\nIn a slightly different way, Forms are Plato\u2019s substances, for everything derives its existence from Forms.\nIn this sense of \u2018substanceany realist philosophical system acknowledges the existence of substances.\nProbably the only theories which do not would be those forms of logical positivism or pragmatism which treat ontology as a matter of convention.\nAccording to such theories, there are no real facts about what is ontologically basic, and so nothing is objectively substance.\nMany of the concepts analysed by philosophers have their origin in ordinary\u2014or at least extra-philosophical\u2014language.", "(II 23 v) This argument seems to conflate the notions of substratum as pure logical support with that as minute parts.\nIf he means minute parts, then, though it is true that we do not and, in his view, cannot know in detail what they are, we have a theory, which he endorses, that they are probably minute parts as conceived by the atomists, which means they have primary qualities similar in kind though not in scale to those possessed by macroscopic objects.", "Substance, they say, is the only category of thing which might have only one instance through at least a minimally extended period of time.\nThus, for example, there is no possible world which has, in a given period of time, only one event, for any non-instantaneous event will be made of events which are its parts.\nSimilarly for properties or tropes, there can never be only one because any one entails the existence of others, as, for example, the existence of a red property (instance) entails the existence of (an instance of) the property colour.", "Buridan, who represents a further development in this direction, says In this sense, I am not the same as I was yesterday, because something was part of my integrity yesterday, which has already been used up, and something was not part of my integrity, which has meanwhile been added by nourishment.\n(Buridan, Physics I,q.10, f. xiii: cited Lagerlund, 476) It is clear that this way of thinking paves the way for atomism and its associated problems as they emerged in early modern philosophy.\nThe concept of substance figures centrally in a positive way for the rationalist philosophers, in a way that it does not for the empiricists.", "The world must possess such enduring objects for it to be intelligible for us\u2014indeed, for us to be part of it, for we are essentially stable bodies amongst other stable bodies.\nThe important point for both Strawson and Kant is that there must be substances for there to be a coherent empirical, spatio-temporal world.\nSubstance has become a formal concept of central importance\u2014that is a concept with a special central role in the structure of our conceptual scheme\u2014rather than being the name for certain kinds of important things in the world.", "It implies only that something from the category of substance might so exist and that this could not be true of any other category.\nOne might wonder what enabled substances that could not exist alone to count as substances at all.\nIf either of the above accounts are successful, substances, properties and events are distinguished.", "When we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the smooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the succession\u2026When we compare its situation after a considerable change the progress of the thought is broken; and consequently we are presented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which contradictions, the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and invisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these variations; and this unintelligible something it calls a substance, or original and first matter.", "We saw in the previous section that the differentia in terms of which a substance is defined is not treated as being \u2018inobjects, as other properties are.\nThis seems to suggest that calling an object a substance of a certain sort is not just a way of attributing to it the properties in terms of which it is defined.", "This involves reinterpreting the rationale of our substance concepts.\nLocke thought that our concept of gold was properly expressed as \u2018anything gold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia\u2019.\nHe thought that we add the optimistic assumption that there will be similarity at the microscopic level.\nWhat many philosophers, under Putnam\u2019s influence, now think he should have said is that gold is that kind of thing which is individuated by a particular kind of minute structure that underlies the stuff which is gold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia.\nIn other words, our confidence that these kinds have a genuine real essence is built into the concept.", "In other words the informed parts of an object \u2013 in the case of a living creature, its organs, and the various kinds of stuff that constituted it (in the end, quantities of earth fire air and water) did not possess their own forms, but were informed by the overall substantial form.", "This brings out a major difference between substances and events, namely that the temporal parts of events are themselves events in their own right, but the temporal parts of objects\u2014meaning by that expression the temporal phases of an object\u2019s existence\u2014are not themselves objects.\nIndeed, it is not natural to talk of the temporal parts of objects, though some philosophers (led by David Lewis (1986), but see also Sider (2001), Hawley (2001) and the entry on temporal parts) think that there are compelling philosophical reasons for doing so.\nThe rationale implicit in our ordinary concept is that an object is wholly present at all the temporal points of its existence.", "This gives a coherent, though speculative, conception of material substance.\nOf spiritual substance, we have no similar hypothesis.\nIf, on the other hand, he means pure logical substratum, there is nothing to know, for there is no more to it, in either the material or spiritual case, than its role as substratum.\nHe seems to conflate the ignorance we have of minute parts with the logical emptiness of the idea of pure substratum.\nIn fact there are three issues concerning the material underpinning of things which Locke regards as mysterious, and he seems to move indifferently from one to the other.", "Furthermore, there is a sense in which all monads are exactly similar to each other, for they all reflect the whole world.\nThey each do so, however, from a different perspective.\nFor God, so to speak, turns on all sides and considers in all ways the general system of phenomena which he has found it good to produce\u2026And he considers all the faces of the world in all possible ways\u2026the result of each view of the universe, as looked at from a certain position, is\u2026a substance which expresses the universe in conformity with that view.\n(1998: 66) So each monad reflects the whole system, but with its own perspective emphasised.", "He asserts that the substantial nature of the physical world is the unknown structure of atomic parts, not a substantial form which reflects our usual concepts.\nThird, he develops a theory of substance which is realist about particular objects and their properties, but conceptualist or conventionalist about our classifications, within the constraints that the facts about particulars and properties impose.\nThere is one important context, however, where Locke does not appear to talk in a conventionalist way about sortal identity, but in a way that seems to be reminiscent of substantial forms.", "Being able to receive contraries.\n(4 a10) A substance can go from being hot to being cold, or from being red to being blue, but the instance of blue in an object cannot similarly take on and lose a wide range of attributes.\nIf substance did not exist it would be impossible for things in any of the other categories to exist.\nThere could be no instances of properties if there were no substances to possess them.\nBut these criteria do not show why \u2018dogis a secondary substance term and \u2018brown thingis not.\nSo we need marks for being a secondary substance, or substance concept.", "Both these conceptions of substance provide difficulties of interpretation.\nThey also both relate to issues in contemporary philosophy of substance, in which Locke\u2019s influence is almost as important as Aristotle\u2019s.\n2.5.1 Locke on \u2018pure substance in generalLocke expresses this idea as follows: The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of those qualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist, sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia, which, according to the true import of the word, is in plain English, standing under or upholding.", "The most obvious is that it does not, as stated, distinguish between substances and events.\nSome property-instances belong to events rather than substances.\nThe performance of a symphony, for example, is an event, and it may possess the property, in one of its movements, of being allegro.\nIt seems plausible that this particular case of something\u2019s being allegro could not have been exemplified by another performance, but the performance might go on to be andante in another movement, so the event can continue to exist without that original property.\nThe assimilation of events with substances in this way seems strained, however.", "This is when he is discussing the individuation of living things.\nHe understands ordinary bodies as mereological sums of atoms.\nAs such, any change of particle constitutes a new object, for a mereological sum is individuated by its parts and a change of parts means a change of the object constituted by those parts.\nTreating ordinary, non-living, bodies as complex enduring objects is a matter of convention determined by the concepts we happen to possess.\nLiving things, however, have a deeper principle of unity.", "But one might still hold that, though the concept of substance is not precisely analysable and is indispensible, substances in fact are nothing but collections of properties.\nThis latter is the de facto option.\nSo the existence of substances does not show that the concept is important from a philosophical perspective, or, if it has some significance, whether this is just as a necessary part of our conceptual scheme, or as an ineliminable feature of reality itself.\n3.2.1 Bundle theories and their problems We have just noted that there could be analytically reductionist or de facto reductionist accounts of substance in terms of properties.", "This question can be given a deflationary or a substantive answer.\nThe deflationary answer is that a substance is a thing which has properties, and that is all one needs to say.\n(See, for example, Crane and Farkas 2004, 143f, and Chisholm 1969.)\nAn object is not composed of properties and some further ingredient\u2014the \u2018thingybit\u2014an object is something which simply has properties.\nAny feature of it can, of course, be regarded as a property, but that does not render an object nothing but a collection of properties.\nThere seems to be a clash of intuitions at this point about what makes sense.", "According to this usage, it is a live issue whether the fundamental entities are substances or something else, such as events, or properties located at space-times.\nThis conception of substance derives from the intuitive notion of individual thing or object, which contrast mainly with properties and events.\nThe issue is how we are to understand the notion of an object, and whether, in the light of the correct understanding, it remains a basic notion, or one that must be characterized in more fundamental terms.\nWhether, for example, an object can be thought of as nothing more than a bundle of properties, or a series of events.", "Thus, a particular instance of colour cannot exist, and could not have existed, without the object of which it is the colour, but the object can exist without the colour instance, for it may change colour and remain the same object, or it could have had a different colour from the start.", "Because he does not believe in void, extension carries with it the other basic properties of matter as features of it.\n2.5.2 Locke on \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substanceThe ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2014called sortals\u2014are formed by collecting such combinations of simple ideas, as are by experience and observation of men\u2019s senses, taken notice of to exist together, and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance.", "On this he says two things.\n\u2018It is reasonable that, after the primary substances, their species and genera should be the only other things called (secondary) substance.\nFor only they, of things predicated, reveal the primary substance.(2 b28\u201330) \u2018Of the secondary substances the species is more a substance than the genus, since it is nearer to the primary substance.\nFor if one is to say of the primary substance what it is, it will be more apt to give the species than the genus.(2 b8\u201311) The second of these two points is more uncontroversial than the first, for it is indubitable that species terms focus more precisely on particular things than generic terms.", "They are not individual objects nor kinds of individual object.\nExamples of this usage are water, hydrogen, copper, granite or ectoplasm.\nThere is a connotation of the word \u2018substance\u2019, reflected in the sense of substantial, which signifies durability or even permanence.\nEvents, or Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are never substantial in this sense, because they are fleeting.\nAtoms, fundamental kinds of stuff, gods, or abstract entities, such as Platonic Forms or numbers, might be considered to be substantial to the point of being indestructible or eternal: they last at least as long as the world exists\u2014and, in the case of gods or God, or abstract entities, perhaps longer.", "It is a strong claim for it purports to prove that any world with individuable objects must be constituted by Aristotelian substances.\nThe argument is powerful because it follows by simple logic, granted seemingly plausible claims about identity, and Leibniz\u2019s Law.\nOn the other hand, there seem to be many cases of objects which can be identified under a variety of concepts, leading to different life histories.", "(iii) rests on the intuition that no collection of properties could, in themselves, amount to a substance: the very idea is a category mistake, and only the presence of a special \u2018substantializingelement could do that.\nIt might be argued that this intuition begs the question against the bundle theory.\nAt the current state of the debate, it looks as if there is no compelling reason for accepting substratum.\nThe Aristotelian tradition anchors the concept of substance, at least in nature, primarily to instances of species of natural object.\nThe Kantian tradition ties it to those enduring bodies the individuation of which gives sense and structure to our spatio-temporal framework.", "(v) and (vi) Kinds of individuals and stuffs.\nAlthough in everything, it is itself no kind of thing and therefore no kind of individual or stuff.\nSubstratum\u2019s claim to substancehood does not rest, however, on meeting the tests itself, but on being what enables particular kinds of substances to be substances.\nAccording to the believer in substratum, it is in virtue of their inhering in a substratum that a collection of properties can constitute an enduring, change-sustaining thing of a certain kind.\nWithout that support, individual instances of properties could, if they could exist at all, be no more than ephemeral events.", "It also avoids the need to employ the \u2018\u201cis\u201d of constitutionto link sortals and particulars, like lumps and hunks, rather than just mass terms, such as \u2018clayor \u2018gold\u2019.\nThe case where the lump and the sortally individuated object do not coincide, applies only to some problematic artefactual cases, and in those cases the sortal name of the artefact will not be suitable substitute for F, but the \u2018lumpexpression will be.\nIn that way, it will be possible to avoid the need to have two material objects in the same place.", "Causation then becomes constant conjunction, or substance a name for a bundle of properties organized in a certain way or the continuing of the possibility of certain sensations.\nKant developed the other variant.", "This can be expressed as: The substances in a given system are those entities crucial from the teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucialmeans that other things exist either to constitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.\nDifferent philosophers emphasize different criteria from amongst this list, for reasons connected with their system as a whole.", "If a monad is at place p at time t, it will contain all the features of the universe at all times, but with those relating to its own time and place most vividly, and others fading out roughly in accordance with temporal and spatial distance.\nBecause there is a continuum of perspectives on reality, there is an infinite number of these substances.\nNevertheless, there is internal change in the monads, because the respect in which its content is vivid varies with time and with action.\nIndeed, the passage of time just is the change in which of the monad\u2019s contents are most vivid.", "Substances, considered as kinds, or instances of kinds, can sustain change\u2014living things, for example, change in size throughout their lives.\nMost individual parcels of matter, however, become different individuals if they change any of their parts; although we have seen that this does not apply to living things, where there seems to be a metaphysical component called sameness of life.", "He argues that the notion of spiritual substance is in no worse a predicament than material substance, because we have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of body: the one being supposed to be (without knowing what it is) the substratum to those simple ideas we have from without; and the other supposed (with a like ignorance of what it is) to be the substratum to those operations which we experiment in ourselves within.\n\u2018Tis plain then, that the idea of corporeal substance in matter, is as remote from our conceptions, and apprehensions, as that of spiritual substance, or spirit;\u2026.", "If this is correct, then our ordinary \u2018natural kindconcepts, like water and gold, have built into them intimations of a deeper unity than that supplied by superficial features, even if it be allied to a complete agnosticism about what that unity might consist in or whether we might ever uncover it.\nHow does Locke, then, rate against the six criteria for substancehood that were set up in the introduction?\nAccepting, for these purposes, that Locke believed in substratum, we can apply these tests both to substratum, and to his \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2019.\nFirst, consider substratum.\n(i) Ontological basicness.", "This distinction, however, is one that has to be handled carefully, especially within a realist Kantian framework, such as Strawson provides.\nThis should become clear below when we discuss Wiggins\u2019s theory, which is both Aristotelian and Strawsonian.\nNevertheless, it gives ground for adding the seventh of the marks of substance mentioned in the Introduction, namely that substances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our spatio-temporal framework and individuation and re-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework.", "That being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in one coherent body, partaking of one common life, it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life, though that life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant\u2026.\n(Essay II.27.4) One might wonder what this \u2018common lifeis supposed to be, especially in the light of his rejection of Aristotelian \u2018substantial forms\u2019.\nFurthermore, it is tempting to argue that all coherent, solid bodies\u2014such as a lump of rock or plasticene\u2014have some principle of organization which persists through change.", "The point cannot be made quite so simply, however.\nProperties could not exist without objects to be properties of, but neither could substances exist without properties, so the dependence appears to be mutual.\nThis problem can be overcome by more careful expression of the point, making it clear that we are not talking about properties in general and substances in general, but about particular instances or cases of a property and the particular objects to which they belong.\nA particular property instance cannot exist and could not have existed without the substance of which it is a property, but the particular substance can exist and could have existed without that property instance.", "Thus we come to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water, etc\u2026 (II xxiii 3) Thus, for Locke, the real essence is an unknown atomic constitution.\nThe types that we categorize them in depend on the properties we happen to be able to perceive and kinds or sorts are defined in terms of these observable properties.\nDefinition in these terms he calls \u2018nominal essence\u2019.\nOur concepts of natural substances presuppose that the nominal essence hides a real essence\u2014that is, that all water, gold, horses etc are in some way similar at a microscopic level.", "First, there is organization of the minute parts of particular kinds of objects, which is responsible for the manifest properties of those objects, and which he thinks will always fall beyond our knowledge.\nSecond is the mystery of what holds the minute parts together: the problem of explaining attraction in a system that only understands influence by impact.\n(xxiii 23).", "It seems, in summary, that there are at least six overlapping ideas that contribute to the philosophical concept of substance.\nSubstances are typified as: being ontologically basic\u2014substances are the things from which everything else is made or by which it is metaphysically sustained; being, at least compared to other things, relatively independent and durable, and, perhaps, absolutely so; being the paradigm subjects of predication and bearers of properties; being, at least for the more ordinary kinds of substance, the subjects of change; being typified by those things we normally classify as objects, or kinds of objects; being typified by kinds of stuff.", "Let us agree, for purposes of argument, that human being is a kind of substance and that rationality and animality are the properties in terms of which that substance is defined.\nIt is uncontroversial that these properties are meant to be objective features of the external world.\nBut what is the relation between the substantial form and those properties?\nIs the presence of the substantial form human being nothing more than the presence of those properties, or is the form something further which is, in some sense responsible for the presence of those properties?", "To give a rough idea, ideas of substance are man, horse; of quantity: four foot, five foot; of qualification; white, grammatical; of a relative: double, half, larger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when: yesterday, last year; of being in a position: is-lying, is-sitting; of having: has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of being-affected: being-cut, being-burnt.", "(Gotthelf 1987, Robinson 1983) By contrast, the behaviour of the matter is influenced by what it is the matter of.\nThe nature of the matter places restrictions on what the enmattered thing can do\u2014an animal can only be made from living tissue, not of stone or fire\u2014but exactly how that matter behaves depends on the substantial form present in it.\nThe substantial form plays, therefore, an essential role, not merely in certain kinds of scientific explanation, but by being a fundamental efficient cause in its own right.", "Would they, without such a substratum be just a stack of qualities, a house of cards with nothing holding them together?\nThere does not seem to be anywhere in the text where Locke discusses this problem\u2014that is, the coherence of atoms as opposed to composite objects\u2014explicitly.\nOne possible resort is to treat solidity as the core or master quality and all the others as features of it.", "It is a necessary condition for F\u2019s being an ultimate sortal that, whenever it applies to something, it applies in a present-tensed manner to the thing through the whole of its existence.\nThe statue and the lump of clay are dealt with by denying that the lump and the statue are identical: the lump of clay constitutes the statue, but is not identical with it.\nNotice that he could have argued that the statue was just a phase of the lump, but he does not do so because statue is not, by its very meaning, a phase sortal: statue, unlike child, does not indicate by its meaning a period in the existence of something.", "The physical mass that houses both the sword and the walking stick can be identified independently of either.\nIf this were not the case it is difficult to see how one could even make the mistake of thinking of it as one thing.\nThe composites Siamese entities form are quite identifiable, and yet that entity is not supposed to fall under a sortal in its own right.", "One would never ask what binds together a patch of colour and its shape, because the shape is the shape of the colour patch, and, though the shape of something can change, its shape cannot come away from it, like a separable component.\nPerhaps the shape, size and density of an atom are similarly features of the solidity.\nThe quality solidity would then become equivalent to the notion of material stuff or material substance and Locke shows no sign of wanting to elide the ideas of quality and substance in this way, though it should be noted that this is what Descartes does with extension.", "The properties [ideas] in terms of which sortals are defined do correspond to real qualities and powers in the world.\nThere is no sense in which these building blocks of reality are creatures of our conceptual scheme.\nThe properties invoked by nominal essences are \u201csupposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance\u201d(xxiii 3).", "Perception, knowledge, causation, and mind would be examples of this.\nBut the concept of substance is essentially a philosophical term of art.\nIts uses in ordinary language tend to derive, often in a rather distorted way, from the philosophical senses.\n(Such expressions as \u2018a person of substanceor \u2018a substantial reasonwould be cases of this.\n\u2018Illegal substancesis nearer to one of the philosophical uses, but not the main one.)\nThere is an ordinary concept in play when philosophers discuss \u2018substance\u2019, and this, as we shall see, is the concept of object, or thing when this is contrasted with properties or events.", "Different properties might have been hung on this hook.\nIt is not so clear, by contrast, that a substratum of the kind Locke considers, or like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter, is a particular in this sense.\nIt is more like a kind of stuff\u2014the substantiveness on to which properties are stuck.\nOn this conception, the suggestion that the \u2018pieceof substratum or \u2018prime matterthat is here in object a, might always instead have been there in object b, seems to lack content.\nIt is useful at this point to take note of the three different functions the thin particular or substratum might fulfil.", "So our division of things into species, though grounded in real continuities in the way that our non-biological (or non-natural) concepts are not, is still nominal.\nAs we shall see, the idea that there is a real unity which is passed on through the life of an object or through any principle of organization is something that Hume criticizes and rejects.\nThe potential for a stronger realism in Locke has been exploited by Putnam and Kripke in their development of a modern, essentialist conception of natural kind terms.", "And substances are distinguished from events in the following way: events are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are temporally composed of further things of the same category (i.e., events): substances are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are not temporally composed of things of the same category (i.e., of substances) but endure singly through the period.", "There could be said to be two rather different ways of characterizing the philosophical concept of substance.\nThe first is the more generic.\nThe philosophical term \u2018substancecorresponds to the Greek ousia, which means \u2018being\u2019, transmitted via the Latin substantia, which means \u2018something that stands under or grounds things\u2019.\nAccording to the generic sense, therefore, the substances in a given philosophical system are those things which, according to that system, are the foundational or fundamental entities of reality.\nThus, for an atomist, atoms are the substances, for they are the basic things from which everything is constructed.", "But he both denies that these real essences play any role in the formation of our concepts and is deeply sceptical of our ever being able to discover what they are.\nHis attitude towards the Aristotelian view is expressed later in the paragraph just quoted: \u2026a philosopher\u2026whatever substantial forms he may talk of, has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are found in them\u2026.\nLocke\u2019s doctrine of sortals is in some respects realist and in some conceptualist or conventionalist.", "The boundaries we draw between kinds of things are, to some degree at least, arbitrary and concept relative.\nI do not deny, but nature, in the constant production of particular beings, makes them\u2026 very much alike and of kin one to another: but I think it nevertheless true, that the boundaries of the species, whereby men sort them, are made by men\u2026.\n(III vi 37: italics in original) The situation in (ii) is greatly aggravated by our ignorance of real essences.\nIf we could know those more accurately, we would know better where to draw the boundaries.\nThe disposition of properties in nature need not have been as it is and might actually contain oddities not corresponding to any of our sortals.", "We shall see later that the Kantian tradition adds a seventh mark of substance: substances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our spatio-temporal framework, and the individuation and re-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework.\n(It should be remarked in passing that at least one major expositor of Aristotle (Irwin: 1988, especially chs 1, 9, 10) attributes a very similar intention to Aristotle himself.)\nIn section 3.5 we shall introduce a notion grounded in Aristotle\u2019s account, but which has not naturally found a place in the earlier discussion, namely the connection between substance and teleology.", "Thus Fido the dog is a primary substance\u2014an individual\u2014but dog or doghood is the secondary substance or substantial kind.\nEach arm of this distinction raises different issues.\nIf one is concerned with kinds of substance, one obvious question that will arise is \u2018what makes something a thing of that kind (for example, what is involved in being a dog)?This is the question of the essence of substantial kinds.\nBut if one is concerned with individuals, the parallel question is \u2018what makes something that particular individual of a given kind (for example, what is involved in a dog\u2019s being and remaining Fido)?This is the question of individual essences and of identity over time.", "It is only by understanding the world as possessing enduring spatio-temporal objects, which enter into causal relations with each other (that is, it is only by applying the categories of substance and causation) that we can have intelligible experience.\nSubstances\u2014that is, a framework of stable, enduring objects\u2014are essential, but the source of this necessity lies not how the world is in itself, but in the framework which we are obliged to impose.\nIn the Kantian philosophy of P. F. Strawson (1959, 1966), this framework of necessity is taken in a more common-sense and realist spirit.", "David Wiggins (1967, 1980, 2001) has made a sustained attempt to prove that these two objectives necessarily go together and to make the Aristotelian notion of substance, even including its bias towards the biological, central to our practice of individuating objects.\nWiggins assumes that individuating a temporally enduring object involves being able to re-identify it at different times and under different descriptions.", "It is possible, and not uncommon, for concepts of a certain kind to be exemplified, but for it to be the case that, nevertheless, entities answering directly to those concepts are not included in the most economical statement of one\u2019s ontology.\nThis is reductionism, and it can operate in either of two ways, namely either analytical reductionism or what one might call de facto or \u2018nothing butreductionism.\nIn the present case, it would conform to the analytical option if the concept of substance could be analysed in terms of properties or events (e.g., \u2018to be a substance =df to be a collection of properties bound together in way W\u2019).", "Locke was pessimistic in two connected respects.\nFirst he was sceptical about the possibility of science discovering the nature of the real essences\u2014the structures of atoms or molecules\u2014that underlie kinds of substance picked out by our ordinary sortals.\nSecond, he doubted whether the objects picked out by our actual substance concepts really shared a real essence in the way we assume that they do.\nHe was not confident, that is, that everything we call gold, or iron, or a monkey, was actually interestingly similar at a non-superficial level.\nBoth these forms of pessimism proved largely unfounded.", "But it remains the case that, by dint of the meaning of the term, a baby is a phase of a human being (or, perhaps, some other animal) even when a particular creature fails to get beyond that phase.\nA sword is not, however, in virtue of the meaning of the word \u2018sword\u2019, a phase of anything, and to use the term to name a phase of something in a given case, when it suits, is ad hoc.\nAllowing sortals of this kind would put the concept of sortal under pressure, for an ultimate sortal was originally thought to be a kind of concept that necessarily characterizes an object present-tensedly throughout its existence, not a concept that sometimes does and sometimes does not.", "It is contested whether Locke actually believed in substance as a characterless substratum.\nAlthough the first quotation above seems to affirm it, Locke also in the same section speaks disparagingly about the idea, comparing it to the notion that the world rests on an elephant, which rests on a tortoise, and so on: in other words, as not constituting a real explanation at all.", "First, it has the intuitive disadvantage that it allocates two solid physical objects to the same place.", "This internal constitution \u201cmakes the whole subsist by itself\u201d (xxiii 6).\nThus Locke is entirely realist about individual bodies and their properties.\nHe is more conventionalist, however, about their classification under particular sortals.\nThere are four ways in which he is a conceptualist about particular substances, as we classify them.\nThere is nothing over and above the properties of an object corresponding to our substance concepts\u2014nothing, that is, like a substantial form\u2014present in the world.\nSortals are entirely formed by our minds, in the light of the properties perceived to be in the world.", "Each of them weighs, say, ten pounds, yet the total of their weight is only ten pounds.\nIt might seem natural to think\u2014and it was formerly a well established maxim\u2014that there can be only one solid physical thing at one place at a given time.\nSomeone impressed by the idea that two bodies cannot be in the same place at the same time might think it more natural to say that there are two different ways of conceptualizing the material presence at that point, than that there are two material things.\nThat way it is easy to see why two ten pound objects need not add up to twenty pounds when put together.", "It is also the case that the properties might be conceived of as universals, or as individuals\u2014that is, property-instances, which are sometimes called \u2018tropes\u2019.\nThere are, therefore, four options for the bundle theorist.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of some relation between properties conceived as universals.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of properties conceived of as individuals, e.g., as property-instances or tropes.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as universals.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as individuals.", "Italics added.)\nThis solution, as Bennett recognizes, makes substancehood a function of how we operate on the properties we perceive.\nIt is, in that sense, more Kantian than realist.\nAs what it recognizes as out there in the world is just a bundle of properties, it does not dissolve the problem in the way that a deflationist would require.\nSubstantive theories take the thought of a further component seriously, and, though they do not seem to be generally distinguished, there are two main conceptions of this extra element, which I will call the \u2018thin particularand the \u2018substratumconceptions.", "Third, is that idea of substance as a bare substratum, which is \u201ca supposed, I know not what, to support those ideas we call accidents.\u201d (xxiii 15).\nPerhaps it is more profitable to ask whether, in his own terms, Locke ought to have accepted bare substratum.\nIf we accept that the question of what binds together the qualities of a macroscopic object can be answered by appeal to the minute parts, the issue would then be what binds the primary qualities of atoms.\nDo the size, shape, mass, solidity of a particular atom require a bare substratum to inhere in for them to constitute a coherent object?", "(1b25\u20132a4) The individual substances are the subjects of properties in the various other categories, and they can gain and lose such properties whilst themselves enduring.\nThere is an important distinction pointed out by Aristotle between individual objects and kinds of individual objects.\nThus, for some purposes, discussion of substance is a discussion about individuals, and for other purposes it is a discussion about universal concepts that designate specific kinds of such individuals.\nIn the Categories, this distinction is marked by the terms \u2018primary substanceand \u2018secondary substance\u2019.", "If properties are conceived of as individuals\u2014otherwise known as tropes, property-instances or individualized forms\u2014then there cannot be a problem about the distinctness of exactly similar bundles, for the difference is built into the identity of the elements of the bundle, as it is not if the bundle is made of universals.\nThe problem for this version of the bundle theory seems to be that it is difficult to individuate or distinguish tropes in a way that makes them suitable to be individuals\u2014in one sense, the substances\u2014from which objects are made.", "On this view, material cohesion is what picks out paradigmatic physical things.", "Fat and the others are described as being in because they pick out a constituent feature that could be said to be, in a logical though not a physical sense, part of, or in him.\nFido the individual is not attributable to any further thing at all.\nThis account is intuitive, but perhaps it cannot be treated as a formally adequate definition of the notion of primary substance or individual.\nFido the individual could be said to be in a certain location and so attributed to something, namely a place.", "He took Hume\u2019s \u2018tendencies of the mind to passfrom one idea to another, without which we could not construct the world, and canonized them as a priori categories of the understanding.\nHume\u2019s empiricist emphasis is psychological.\nIt concerns what we are habituated to do.\nBecause of his empiricism, he will not bring non-psychological necessity into it.\nNevertheless, there is the implication that making these transitions is the only way in which one can understand the world.\nKant drops the empirical psychology and makes it a matter of a priori psychology, that only by employing certain categories could we have experience as of a physical world.", "It is natural to say that the statue is made of clay or even from a piece of clay.\nBut suppose one characterizes the clay more exactly, in terms of the particular atoms in a particular arrangement.\nStrictly, on modal grounds, this structured collection and the statue are different.\nThe statue could have been made of a collection of atoms with at least some different members, but the entity defined as containing just those atoms could not.\nThis entity\u2014atoms A 1 \u2026A n in given spatial arrangement S\u2014is not a very natural kind of object, but it is a real body, in a way that something arbitrarily composed of, for example, half of this table and two toes from President Bush\u2019s left foot is not.", "It does not seem natural to say that the same event was first allegro, then andante, because it is more natural to attribute the different properties to different parts of the event, which are themselves events (in this case, movements).", "Artifactual sortals generally designate distinct, unified bodies (as do \u2018swordand \u2018walking stickin the ordinary cases), though exceptions ( as in the case of the swordstick considered above) are more common and less fantastic than in the natural cases.\nThere are acceptable substitutions for F which would not normally be classified as sortals, but using concepts such as piece, or hunk or lump of stuff.\nIn at least some of these cases, there is no sortal available.", "For footed and two-footed are said of man as subject, but are not in a subject; neither footed not two-footed is in man.\n(3 a23\u20135) It would seem that these properties belong to objects in different ways when they are part of a definition from when they are not.\nThe issue is what constitutes the unity of the species or secondary substance: why is it not just a collection of properties and, if it is just such a collection, why is it so different from any other collection of properties?", "By the expression \u2018ad hoc phase sortalI mean a sortal that can be used sometimes as a phase sortal, designating an object only through part of its existence, and sometimes as an ultimate sortal, designating an object through the whole of its existence.\nOf course, even normal phase sortal might, contingently, in a given instance, designate an object through the whole of its existence.\nOne might say that the phase sortal baby could designate something through the whole of its existence if, for example, a human being died at the age of six months and hence never got beyond babyhood.", "All natural ultimate sortals designate unified physical bodies in the manner prescribed in (1), and so are very suitable as substitutions for F. It is logically possible, however, that this might not have been so (there might logically have been natural sortals that worked like swordstick), but that they do follow this model, and are not like swordstick, is a pretty deep fact about our world and about any world with similar laws of nature to those that hold in our world.", "Its role might be (i) to bind the properties into a unity, so that they do not \u2018fall apart\u2019: (ii) to individualize them, if they are universals: (iii) to carry one across the categorial barrier from property to substance; that is, to be what it is that makes something to be in the category of substance.\nThe first role will not be necessary if one thinks that there is a \u2018master propertyof which the others are modes, or if one thinks that unity can come from some causal or organizational connection.\n(ii) will not apply to a tropist theory, or if one thinks that location will do the job.", "The division between being said of and being in\u2014that is, between substance concepts and other properties\u2014seems intuitively clear enough until one remembers that substance concepts are complex and are definable in terms of other properties.\nThus, \u2018manis defined as \u2018featherless bipedor \u2018rational animal\u2019, and it would seem that \u2018featherless\u2019, \u2018two-footedor \u2018rationalare properties and hence the kinds of things that are in objects.\nAristotle denies that this is so when they enter into the definition of a substance.\nThe features that specifically make an object the kind of substance that it is, are called differentiae, and Aristotle says the differentia also is not in a subject.", "The rationalistssubstances are not, however, the individual objects of everyday life.\nDescartes believed in only two kinds of substance: material body, which is defined by extension, and mental substance, which is defined by thought, which, in this context, is more or less equivalent to consciousness.\nDescartes (like Aristotle and unlike most of his contemporaries and immediate successors) was not an atomist.\nHe did not believe in a void between bodies, so there is a sense in which there is just one material substance, numerically as well as specifically.\nFor Descartes, therefore, material substance falls more naturally into the stuff category, rather than into the thing category.", "Second, generation and decay depend on the material component in composites.\nAny form that does not require matter for its activity will be eternal by nature.", "These Forms are not substances in the sense of being either the stuff or the individuals or the kinds of individuals out of which all else is constructed.\nRather they are the driving principles which give structure and purpose to everything else.\nIn itself, the rest would be, at most, an unintelligible chaos.\nThe Forms meet criterion (i)\u2014ontological basicness\u2014but in a slightly eccentric way, because they do not, in a normal sense, constitute things.\nThey meet (ii)\u2014durability\u2014in a strong fashion, for they are eternal.\nThey are not, in the intended senses, the subjects of predication, and in no sense the subjects of change, so they do badly on (iii) and (iv).", "Many of the pre-socratic philosophers in fact had a concept of substance rather like that above attributed to chemistry: that is, their emphasis was on criterion (vi) above.\nThey thought, that is, that the being of the universe (hence they were pursuing substance in sense (i)) consisted in some kind or kinds of stuff.\nThales, for example, thought that everything was essentially water, and Anaximenes that everything was a form of air.\nFor Anaximander, the \u2018stuffin question was indeterminate, so that it could transmute into the various determinate stuffs such as water, air earth and fire.", "He copes with the second by denying that origin is essential to identity.\nUnfortunately, he argues for this position by citing human subjects: Socrates, for example, would still have been who he was even if he had had different parents.\nThis is, of course, controversial about humans, but it is our Cartesian intuitions that make it plausible in that case.", "In particular, we shall look at the issue of whether objects must be individuated under the kind of sortal expressions that correspond to Aristotelian substance concepts, or whether a more generic notion, such as physical body, will suffice.\nThis latter concern will lead on to a consideration of the connection between substance and teleology.\nOne natural response to the question of what distinguishes substances from properties is that properties depend for their existence on substances, for they are properties of objects (that is, of individual substances), but that substances do not similarly depend on properties for their existence.", "More formally, this can be expressed as follows: If a = b then (a) there is a sortal F such that: a is an F b is an F a is the same F as b.\nThe second claim is that is that if the object picked out by \u2018aalso falls under another sortal, G, then so will the object picked out by \u2018b\u2019, and it will be the same G as a.\nThis is represented as an application of Leibniz\u2019s Law, for if a is the-same-G-as-a (as it must be) then, as a = b, b must be the-same-G-as-a.\n(b) for any sortal G, a is G iff b is G, if a is G then b is the same G as a.", "The other is that it cannot cope with the necessity of origin for individual identity.\nLowe responds to the former objection by saying that essential properties are identical with the substance, so cannot be cited as something other than substance that meets his criterion for being substance.\nIt is not clear that this will work.\nThe idea that the essence is identical with the substance is Aristotelian, but it is not clear how this applies to essential properties, taken individually.\nWe have already seen, in our discussion of Aristotle, that the relation between the essence as some kind of unity and the properties that seem to constitute it is not clear.", "It embodies the principle that if anything is both an F and a G, where F and G are normally ordinary sortals, then it is really an F/G and ceases to exist if it loses either its F or its G features and is replaced by something that is either just an F or just a G/ One possible way out of this kind of case is to say that the sword is a phase of the walking stick, thereby introducing ad hoc phase sortals.", "The question remains, however, how far these are nominal and how far real distinctions.\nThat there is a difference between substance concepts and property concepts has definitely been shown, but does it follow that there are, in reality two different kinds of thing, namely properties and substances?\nThe answer might seem to be obvious.\nGiven that there are substance concepts, if those concepts are instantiated, then there are substances in reality.\nCat, table, human being, are substance concepts by the above accounts, and there are cats, tables and humans, so there are substances in reality as well as properties.\nThe matter is not so simple, however.", "Leibniz acknowledges created substances, though they are very intimately dependent on God.\nIn the Discourse on Metaphysics, (Section 14), he says: it is clear that created substances depend on God, who conserves them and indeed who produces them continuously by a kind of emanation, just as we produce our thoughts.\n(1998: 66) The analogy with thought hardly emphasizes the independence of substance!\nNevertheless, created substances do constitute the created world, and do, in that sense, meet criterion (i) for being substance."]
