of a deal to buy 65 F-35s as a replacement for its ageing CF-188s.\nCiting a letter from 13 former senior Royal Canadian Air Force officers which argues that the acquisition of such a small fleet

without the new competition promised by the Liberals during the election campaign.\nHowever Sajjan refused to commit to a new competition or independent oversight raising concerns that the bold promises made to ditch the F-35 is causing a capability crisis.\nMay 31/16: A new sense of urgency has been injected into Canada\u2019s CF-18 fighter replacement by Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan, saying that the issue \u201cneeds to be dealt with quickly.\u201d Speaking at the CANSEC defence and military trade show in Ottawa last week, Sajjan didn\u2019t forget to remind reporters that the

initial operating capability in 2018.\nThat would be 38 years after the F/A-18 Hornet won Canada\u2019s last fighter competition, and 36 years after initial Hornet deliveries.\nUnder this timeline,
