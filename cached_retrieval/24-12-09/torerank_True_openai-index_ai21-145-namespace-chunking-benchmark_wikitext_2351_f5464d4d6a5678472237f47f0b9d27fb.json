["The rules established in 1935 were accepted but needed to be extended to include the cultigens of agriculture and forestry, but it was only a result of discussions at the 1950 International Botanical Congress in Stockholm and the 18th International Horticultural Congress in London in 1952 the first International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants was published in 1953.\nThe American horticultural botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey was responsible for coining the word cultigen in 1918 and cultivar in 1923, the word cultivar only coming into general circulation with the new Code of 1953.", "Friedrich Alefeld (1820 \u2013 1872), who used Latin variety names, in a monographic study of beans, lentils and other legumes distinguished three infraspecific taxonomic categories: Unterart (subspecies), Variet\u00e4ten Gruppe and Kultur-Variet\u00e4t, all with Latin names.\nIn doing this he was probably laying the ground for the later establishment of the cultigen classification categories cultivar and Group.\nIn conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a horticultural nomenclature component.", "The history of cultigen nomenclature has been discussed by William T. Stearn and Brandenberg, Hetterscheid and Berg.\nIt has also been examined from a botanical perspective and from the origin of the Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 until 2004.\nThe early development of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general as the early listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds.", "William T. Stearn (1911 \u2013 2001), taxonomic botanist, classical scholar and author of the book Botanical Latin has commented that \"cultivated plants [cultigens] are mankind's most vital and precious heritage from remote antiquity\".\nCultigens of our most common economic plants probably date back to the first settled communities of the Neolithic Revolution 10,000 to 12,000 years ago although their exact time and place of true origin will probably remain a mystery.", "As early as the 5th century BCE the Greek philosopher Hippo expressed the opinion that cultigens (as we call them now) were produced from wild plants as the result of the care bestowed on them by man, a revolutionary view at a time when they were regarded as the special creation and gift of the gods.\nIn devising ways of classifying organisms the philosopher Aristotle (384 \u2013 322 BCE) established the important idea of a fundamentum divisionis \u2014 the principle that groups can be progressively subdivided.\nThis has been assumed in biological classification ever since and is congruent with the relatively recent idea of evolution as descent with modification.", "As the community of people dealing with the cultigens of commerce grew so, once again, the divergence between taxonomy serving scientific purposes and utilitarian taxonomy meeting human needs re-emerged.\nIn 1865 German botanist Karl Koch, who became General Secretary of the Berlin Horticultural Society, expressed resentment at the continued use of Latin for cultigen names.\nMany proposals to deal with this were made, perhaps the most prominent being the Lois de la nomenclature botanique submitted in 1867 to the fourth Horticultural and Botanical Congress by Swiss botanist Alphonse de Candolle who, in Article 40 stated:", "\"Seedlings, half-breeds (mtis) of unknown origin or sports should receive from horticulturists fancy names (noms de fantaisie) in common language, as distinct as possible from the Latin names of species or varieties.\"\nThis Article, making provision for the cultigens of horticultural nomenclature was to remain in the Botanical Code (with a minor amendment in 1935 suggesting the use of the letter 'c' before the horticultural name and antedating formal recognition of the cultivar) through 1906, 1912 and 1935 until the separation, in 1953, of the Horticultural Code, precursor to the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (Cultivated Plant Code).", "The history of cultivated plant taxonomy can be traced from the first plant selections that occurred during the agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans.\nThe naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar.\nSince that time the classification and naming of cultigens has followed its own path.", "The terms cultigen and cultivar may be confused with each other.\nCultigen is a general-purpose term for plants that have been deliberately altered or specially selected by humans, while cultivar is a formal classification category.\nCultigens include not only plants with cultivar names but also those with names in the classification categories of grex and Group.", "The Cultivated Plant Code points out that cultigens are: deliberately selected plants that may have arisen by intentional or accidental hybridization in cultivation, by selection from existing cultivated stocks, or from variants within wild populations that are maintained as recognizable entities solely by continued propagation.\nIncluded within the group of plants known as cultigens are genetically modified plants, plants with binomial Latin names that are the result of ancient human selection, and any plants that have been altered by humans but which have not been given formal names.", "Formal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple binomial system of folk taxonomy and it was not until the mid-19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy.", "In practice most cultigens are cultivars.\nThe following account of the historical development of cultivated plant taxonomy traces the way cultigens have arisen and been incorporated into botanical science; it also demonstrates how two approaches to plant nomenclature and classification have led to the present-day International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants and International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants.", "Although economic herbs and spices had a long history in trade, and there are good records of cultivar distribution by the Romans, European botanical and horticultural exploration rapidly increased in the 19th century with the colonial expansion taking place at the time.\nNew plants were brought back to Europe while, at the same time, valuable economic plants, including those from the tropics, were distributed among the colonies.\nThis plant trade has provided the common global heritage of economic and ornamental cultigens that we use today and which formed the stock for modern plant selection, breeding, and genetic engineering.\nThe plant exchange that occurred as a result of European trade can be divided into several phases:", "Included among cultigens are : simple selections taken from plants in the wild or in cultivation ; artificial hybrids produced both by accident and intention ; plants produced by genetic engineering ; clonal material reproduced by cuttings grafting budding layering etc\n; graft @-@ chimaeras ; selections from the wild ; ancient selections of crops that date back thousands of years ; selections of aberrant growth such as witches brooms ; the results of deliberate repeatable single crosses between two pure lines to produce plants of a particular general appearance that is desirable for horticulture but which are not genetically identical\nThe question remains as to whether the classification categories of cultivar Group and grex are the most appropriate and efficient way to deal with this broad range of plant variation\n= The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover =", "In 1700 French botanist J.P. de Tournefort although still using the broad groupings of \"trees\" and \"herbs\" for flowering plants, began to use flower characteristics as distinguishing features and, most importantly, provided a clear definition of the genus as a basic unit of classification.\nIn Institutiones Rei Herbariae he listed about 10,000 different plants, which he called species, organised into 698 genera with illustrations.\nThe establishment of this precursor of scientific classification vastly improved the organisation of plant variation into approximately equivalent groups or ranks and many of his genera were later taken up by Carl Linnaeus.", "The formation and use of the three classification categories (ranks) used for cultigens, the cultivar, Group and grex, is regulated by the ICNCP.\nExamples of acceptable ways to present cultigen names are given below:", "Amendments to the Cultivated Plant Code are prompted by international symposia for cultivated plant taxonomy which allow for rulings made by the International Commission on the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants.\nEach new Cultivated Plant Code includes a summary of the changes made to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995.", "The first Cultivated Plant Code (Wageningen), which was published in 1953, has been followed by eight subsequent editions \u2013 in 1958 (Utrecht), 1961 (update of 1958), 1969 (Edinburgh), 1980 (Seattle), 1995 (Edinburgh), 2004 (Toronto) and 2009 (Wageningen).\nFollowing the structure of the Botanical Code the Cultivated Plant Code is set out in the form of an initial set of Principles followed by Rules and Recommendations that are subdivided into Articles.", "In horticulture at this time there existed all the problems that had confronted botanists in the 19th century \u2013 a plethora of names of various length, written and published in many languages with much duplication.\nThe period between 1867 and 1953 was an uneasy time in which American horticulturists and other groups in Europe, such as the specialist orchid community, made attempts to put order into this chaos within their particular group of interest and devising their own rules for naming the plants of commerce.", "The natural distribution of plants across the world has determined when and where cultigens have been produced.\nThe botanical and horticultural collection of economically important plants, including ornamentals, was based in Europe.", "The use of these two terms belies the multitude of classification terms and categories that had been suggested as designations for cultigens.", "As a result of general dissatisfaction and a submission from the Royal Horticultural Society the R\u00e8gles de Nomenclature Horticole was established.\nThe use of simple descriptive Latin names (e.g.\ncompactus, nanus, prostratus) for horticultural variants was accepted and so too were names in the local language \u2013 which were not to be translated and should preferably consist of one word and a maximum of three.\nThis first Horticultural Code consisted of 16 Articles.\nWith the intercession of a World War I it was not until the 9th Horticultural Congress in London in 1930 that the rules of a Horticulture Nomenclature Committee were agreed and added as an appendix to the 1935 Botanical Code.", "In the Western world among the first cultigens would have been selections of the cereals wheat and barley that arose in the early settlements of the Fertile Crescent (the fertile river valleys of the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates) in the Western Mediterranean.\nFood plant selections would also have been made in the ten or so other centres of settlement that occurred around the world at this time.", "Most cultigens have names consisting of a Latin name that is governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants e.g.\nMalus domestica, to which is added a cultigen epithet, enclosed in single quotes e.g.\nMalus domestica 'Granny Smith'.", "The ways in which the plant variation resulting from human activity is named and classified remains contentious.\nThe replacement of the expression \"cultivated plant\" with the word \"cultigen\" is not universally accepted.\nThe debate continues concerning the notions of ranks and taxa as applied to cultigens.\nIs it appropriate to call the highly modified transgenic products of human artificial selection \"taxa\" in the same way we do for the products of natural selection in the wild?", "Recent concerns have focused on international communication on cultivated plant taxonomy, organisation of international symposia, and general communication on topics of interest.\nIn 1988 a Horticultural Taxonomy Group (Hortax) was formed in the UK and a parallel organisation, the Nomenclature and Registration Working Group of the Vaste Keurings Commissie in the Netherlands.", "Those cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria: they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations (except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name); it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation.", "In the early 18th century colonial expansion and exploration created a demand for the description of thousands of new organisms.\nThis highlighted difficulties in communication about plants, the replication of their descriptions, and the importance of an agreed way of presenting, publishing and applying their

became known from then on as the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (now the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants).\nAfter World War II the responsibility for the Botanical Code was taken up by the International Association for Plant Taxonomy and meetings to discuss revisions are held at six-yearly intervals, the latest being in 2005", "Much of the work of the cultivated plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes.\nThe provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Botanical Code) serve primarily scientific ends and the objectives of the scientific community, while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (Cultivated Plant Code) are designed to serve both scientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce \u2014 the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and horticulture.\nThese names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.", "The revival of learning during the Renaissance reinvigorated the study of plants and their classification.\nFrom about 1400 CE European expansion established Latin as the common language of scholars and it was adopted for biological nomenclature.\nThen, from about 1500 CE, the publication of herbals (books often illustrated with woodcuts describing the appearance, medicinal properties, and other characteristics of plants used in herbal medicine) extended the formal documentation of plants and by the late 16th century the number of different plant kinds described in Europe had risen to about 4,000.", "To overcome this difficulty the term culton (pl.\nculta) has been suggested to replace the word taxon when speaking about cultigens.\nThen, most \"wild\" plants fit neatly into the nested hierarchy of ranks used in Linnaean classification (species into genera, genera into families etc.)\nwhich aligns with Darwinian descent with modification.\nChoosing classification categories for cultigens is not clear-cut.", "The earliest scientific (rather than utilitarian) approach to plants is attributed to Aristotle's student Theophrastus (371 \u2013 286 BCE), known as the \"father of botany\".\nIn his Enquiry into Plants Theophrastus described 480 kinds of plant, dividing the plant kingdom into trees, shrubs, undershrubs and herbs with further subdivision into wild and cultivated, flowering and non-flowering, deciduous or evergreen.\nThe utilitarian approach, classifying plants according to their medicinal properties, is exemplified by the work of Roman nobleman, scientist and historian, Pliny the Elder (29 \u2013 79 CE) author of Naturalis historiae.", "From the time of the ancient world, at least, plants have been classified in two ways.\nOn the one hand there is the detached academic, philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves: this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function.\nThen there is the practical, utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use.\nCultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture, horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code.\nThis Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature, it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce.", "Cuttings are an extremely effective way of perpetuating desirable characters, especially of woody plants like grapes, figs and olives so it is not surprising that these are among the first known plant selections perpetuated in cultivation in the West.\nMigrating people would take their plant seeds and cuttings with them; there is evidence of early Fertile Crescent cereal cultigens being transferred from Western Asia to surrounding lands.", "Cultivated plant taxonomy is the study of the theory and practice of the science that identifies, describes, classifies, and names cultigens \u2014 those plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity.\nCultivated plant taxonomists do, however, work with all kinds of plants in cultivation.\nCultivated plant taxonomy is one part of the study of horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, or government departments.\nAreas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about cultivated plants.", "One development promoting discussion was the newsletter Hortax News which was superseded in February 2006 by the first issue of Hanburyana, a journal produced by the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated to horticultural taxonomy.\nThis filled a gap left when the American journal Baileya ceased publication in the early 1990s.\nAnother development was the launch, in 2007, at the Sixth Symposium on the Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants at Wageningen of the International Association for Cultivated Plant Taxonomy.", "Cultivated plant taxonomy has been distinguished from the taxonomy of other plants in at least five ways.\nFirstly, there is a distinction made according to where the plants are growing \u2014 that is, whether they are wild or cultivated.\nThis is alluded to by the Cultivated Plant Code which specifies in its title that it is dealing with cultivated plants.\nSecondly, a distinction is made according to how the plants originated.\nThis is indicated in Principle 2 of the Cultivated Plant Code which defines the scope of the Code as \"... plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to the intentional actions of mankind\" \u2014 plants that have evolved under natural selection with human assistance.", "Thirdly, cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with plant variation that requires the use of special classification categories that do not conform with the hierarchy of ranks implicit in the Botanical Code, these categories being the cultivar, Group and grex (which are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code).\nThis feature is also referred to in the Preamble to the Cultivated Plant Code which states that \"The purpose of giving a name to a taxon is not to indicate its characters or history, but to supply a means of referring to it and to indicate to which category it is assigned.\"", "Confining crops to local areas gave rise to landraces (selections that are highly adapted to local conditions) although these are now largely replaced by modern cultivars.", "The key activities of cultivated plant taxonomy relate to classification (taxonomy) and naming (nomenclature).\nThe rules associated with naming plants are separate from the methods, principles or purposes of classification, except that the units of classification, the taxa, are placed in a nested hierarchy of ranks \u2013 like species within genera, and genera within families.\nThere are three classification categories used in the Cultivated Plant Code, the cultivar and the Group and the grex, but they are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code.", "Finally, the difference between cultivated plant taxonomy and the taxonomy of other plants has been attributed to the purpose for which the taxonomy has been devised, it being plant-centred in the Botanical Code and human-centred in the Cultivated Plant Code.", "Fourthly, cultivated plant taxonomy serves a particular

built of stone, this was a three-storied structure 82 feet (25 m) long, 60 feet (18 m) wide and 50 feet (15 m) high.\nInternally the keep was divided to form a long hall and a solar and was lit by large, rounded windows.\nThe keep had architectural similarities to various nearby castles in the region, but in particular to those at Middleham and Outhgill.\nA ditch formed an inner defensive bailey around the keep, with the ramparts of the old fort forming a larger, outer bailey.\nA mill, then an essential part of any castle, was built by the River Greta to supply flour for the garrison.", "Mani Ratnam was born on 2 June 1955, as the second child of a family that was closely associated with film production.\nHis father S.
