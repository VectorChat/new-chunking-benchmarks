take advantage of large feeding pits excavated by the bat ray ( Myliobatis californica ) for shelter and food\nAs they mature horn sharks shift into shallower water and their preferred habitat becomes structurally complex rocky reefs or algae beds\nThis strongly benthic species seldom ventures more than 2 m ( 6 @.\n@ 6 ft ) above the substrate\nThe relative abundances of the horn shark and the swellshark ( Centroscyllim ventriosum ) which shares the same habitat are negatively correlated because horn sharks prefer temperatures warmer than 20 \u00b0 C ( 68 \u00b0 F ) while swellsharks are more cold @-@ tolerant\nAt Santa Catalina Island a 20 @-@ year warming trend has resulted in an increase in the horn shark population and a decrease in the swellshark population\nHorn sharks are less

of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 951 mbar (hPa; 28.08 inHg), which marked its landfall.\nThe hurricane rapidly weakened upon moving inland, and roughly 12 hours after landfall, Bret weakened to a tropical storm.\nIt further degenerated into a tropical depression by the evening of August 23.\nThe remnants of Bret persisted until August 26, at which time they dissipated over the

clams, and have been known to \"pounce\" on anemones to bite off tentacles before they can be retracted.\nOff southern California, horn sharks are known to take advantage of seasonal opportunities.\nIn the summer, diurnally active fishes, in particular the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis), are especially abundant and are easily captured at night when they lie dormant.\nIn the

the outflow openings to the mouth\nThe mouth is small and curved with prominent furrows at the corners\nThere are 19 \u2013 26 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 18 \u2013 29 tooth rows in the lower jaw\nThe teeth at the front of the jaws are small and pointed with a central cusp flanked by a pair of lateral cusplets ; those at the sides of the jaws are much larger elongated lengthwise and molar @-@ like\nThe body is cylindrical with two high somewhat falcate ( sickle @-@ shaped ) dorsal fins bearing stout spines at the front\nThe fin spines of reef @-@ dwelling horn sharks are shorter than those living in algal habitats as their spines become worn down on rocks from the sharks ' movements\nThe first dorsal fin originates over the bases of the large pectoral fins while the second dorsal fin originates slightly anterior to the free rear tips of the pelvic fins\nThe caudal fin has a short lower lobe and a long broad upper lobe with a strong notch near the tip\nThe horn shark's dermal denticles are small and smooth numbering some 200 / cm2 on the back in adults\nThe dorsal coloration consists of various shades of gray or brown with many small dark spots though these may be absent in older sharks ; the underside is yellowish\nThere is a dark patch of small spots below the eye\nThis species may reach a length of 1 @.\n@ 2 m ( 3 @.\n@ 9 ft ) though most individuals do not exceed

flexible muscular pectoral fins to push itself along the bottom\nIt is usually solitary though small groups have been recorded\nDuring the day horn sharks rest motionless hidden inside caves or crevices or within thick mats of algae though they remain relatively alert and will swim away quickly if disturbed\nAfter dusk they roam actively above the reef in search of food\nHorn sharks maintain small home ranges of around 1 @,@ 000 m2 ( 11 @,@ 000 sq ft ) which they may remain faithful to for over a decade returning to the same shelter every day\nThe shelter is usually located at the edge of the resident shark's foraging area\nThe longest documented movement for an individual horn shark is 16 km ( 9 @.\n@ 9 mi )\nUnlike most fishes the daily activity pattern of the horn shark is under exogenous control meaning that it is regulated by environmental factors rather than by an internal physiological cycle\nObservations of captive horn sharks show that the relevant cue is light intensity : the sharks become active immediately after the lights are turned off and stop as soon as they are turned back on\nIn one experiment where the sharks were kept in darkness they remained continuously active for 11 days before slowing possibly from fatigue\nIn nature horn sharks exposed to a bright light at night may stop swimming and sink to the bottom\nThe horn shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and the northern elephant seal ( Mirounga angustirostris ) which consumes adults juveniles and egg cases\nIn addition they are captured and eaten by bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) at Catalina Island and large marine snails are able to drill into their egg cases to extract the yolk\nThe tough skin and spines of this species confer some protection ; a Pacific angelshark ( Squatina californica ) has been filmed engulfing a juvenile horn shark only to spit it out due to its spines\nKnown parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium
