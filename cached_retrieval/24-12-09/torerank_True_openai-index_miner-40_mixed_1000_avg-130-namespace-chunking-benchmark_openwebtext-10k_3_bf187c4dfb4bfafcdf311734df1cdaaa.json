["Apollo 8 December 21-27, 1968 Apollo 8 gave the trajectory people some interesting problems to figure out.\nMany of them remembered the complexity of rendezvous during Gemini and that was in Earth orbit.\nPerforming a rendezvous with another world 250,000 miles away was a whole different ballpark.\nWhile Kranz did not plan to participate in the control room for this mission, he did find opportunity to stop by.\nApollo 8 really belonged to Llewellyn and his team in the Trench, along with a fellow named Bill Tindall.\nTindall had been brought in to help pull things together after the Apollo 1 fire and Llewellyn\u2019s people sparred with him at first.", "Charlesworth the \u201cMississippi Gambler\u201d wasn\u2019t as laid back as normal and went out for a couple of cigarettes.\nThere was nothing any of them could do but watch the clock and hope to reacquire the signal on schedule.\nThe minutes dragged on until the clock reached zero.\n\u201cFlight, we\u2019ve had telemetry reacquisition.\u201d A relieved control team let out a few cheers and went back to reviewing the data.\nApollo 8 was in the planned orbit just sixty miles above the surface.\nThe crew described craters that they named in honor of space luminaries like Gilruth, Kraft, Slayton and Low and also honored fallen astronauts Grissom, White, Chaffee, Ted Freeman, Elliot See, C. C. Williams and Charlie Bassett.", "Tindall won their respect quickly enough and they spent a lot of time debating ideas.\nKranz had to fight the urge to jump in and help.\nThis was his first mission as FCD chief and he was understandably keyed up.\nHis team assured him that everything was on schedule and, the evening before the launch, they got a surprise visitor.\nCharles Lindbergh stopped by to say hello and Kranz chose to interpret it as a good sign.\n\u201cLucky Lindy\u201d had been the first to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and it seemed to Kranz like he was silently passing the baton on to the next generation of pioneers.", "For all that the other flight directors teased him about it, none of them could deny that they were tense today, as well.\nChris Kraft was sitting at the back of the room and kept asking Charlesworth about the status of the countdown.\nCharlesworth finally threatened to have him kicked out of the control room if he didn\u2019t cool it.\nThis was one of the few times when a flight director could talk back to his boss and Kraft desisted.\nAt first, the launch could have been just another simulation if it wasn\u2019t for the presence of luminaries like Bob Gilruth and the MCC\u2019s in-house PR representative, Jack Riley.", "Kranz had a hard time keeping a straight face as he explained, \u201cWe have orders to patch communications through to Sealab so Carpenter can give the countdown for the retrofire.\nI argued with Kraft about it but he says, \u2018Do it!\n'\u201d Llewellyn was furious and inadvertently pulled Dave Scott into the gotcha by telling him all about the fictional test.\nScott blew up and threatened to quit the program if this was the kind of crazy decision he could expect during a mission.\nKranz let them both dangle for a few more minutes before explaining that it was all a joke.\nKranz had taken up Judo at Llewellyn\u2019s invitation and realized that the evening\u2019s match was going to be an especially rough one.", "The control room was almost completely silent except for the voice of CapCom Gerry Carr, \u201cYou\u2019re Go for lunar orbit insertion.\u201d No one on Earth would know if the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) engine burn was successful until Apollo 8 emerged from the radio blackout that came with being on the far side of the moon.\nCarr told the crew, \u201cApollo 8, you\u2019re looking good.\n\u2026 Ten seconds to loss of signal.\u201d Jim Lovell answered, \u201cSee you on the other side.\u201d They heard a burst of static.\nNow came a tense half hour of waiting.\nThe time for the LOI came and went and the controllers took the opportunity for a break.", "Deke Slayton was in town, too, and received word that Conrad and Hunter had gotten into a heated argument over who was in charge.\nHunter had threatened to kick Conrad out of the station for butting into his turf and the hapless station crew sent a message asking for clarification about whose orders they should follow.\nHe went straight to the apartment where Kranz and Kraft were staying.\nThey had fallen asleep, but the banging on the door woke them right up.\nSlayton shouted, \u201cChris, we got a problem!\u201d Kranz threw on some clothes and, by the time he got out there, Kraft and Slayton were about ready to duke it out.", "Scott Carpenter had just started his thirty-day Sealab mission and Llewellyn hadn\u2019t forgotten his line, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d Kranz recruited FIDO, RETRO and CapCom as co-conspirators and told them that he wanted to convince Llewellyn that the countdown for the retrofire would come from Sealab.\nLlewellyn came into Mission Control to start his shift and FIDO pretended to be so focused on his job that he didn\u2019t even respond to Llewellyn\u2019s greeting.\nSo he asked RETRO what was going on and RETRO answered, \u201cIt\u2019s this dad-blamed test from Sealab.\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Llewellyn got curious and asked Kranz.", "Kranz checked out communications on his and Kraft\u2019s console.", "Kranz explained to the top players in the room that there was a lot of energy stored up in the shroud\u2019s release mechanism and Cernan would have nothing to latch onto while he worked.\nNewtonian physics applied while in orbit and just using a screwdriver could send him spinning if he had nothing to hold onto.\nIf that thing came off with Cernan nearby, they stood a chance of losing one astronaut.\nNASA didn\u2019t need that kind of poor publicity.\nHe was overridden and, even worse, Chris Kraft had done nothing to back him up.\nFurious, Kranz threatened to quit after the mission was over.", "The comrades in Mission Control celebrated with a big bash that night.\nMission Control\u2019s transfer to Houston was getting into high gear and Kranz sent out one of Control\u2019s new recruits, Manfred \u201cDutch\u201d Von Ehrenfried, as a real estate scout.\nKranz\u2019s only conditions were that the housing be affordable and that the down payment not be more than $250.\nThe part of Houston that Von Ehrenfried found for them came to be known as Flight Controller Alley.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) was also growing in size, from 750 to 1800 employees in three months.\nMany of these new people were brand-new graduates from colleges around Texas.", "They took numerous pictures, including this iconic image of the Earth rising over the moon.\nThe crew had been working for almost a full day by this point and Borman decided that the crew should get some rest before the trans-Earth injection burn that would put them on course for the return to Earth.\nKranz was observing from one of the consoles in the back of the room when Bill Anders revealed his Christmas Eve surprise.\nHe began reading the Creation story from the Book of Genesis.\nKranz, a Catholic, felt chills go down his spine as Jim Lovell and then Frank Borman picked up the story.\nWhat could possibly be more appropriate?", "Borman closed it out with, \u201cAnd from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you \u2013 all of you on the planet Earth.\u201d As the crew settled into a route back to Earth, some of the controllers kidded about the possibility of actually hitting the carrier assigned to retrieve the crew during the final reentry phase.\nThe guidance system had improved that much.\nLuckily, that didn\u2019t happen and the Apollo 8 crew had a successful splashdown on December 27, 1968.\nApollo 9 With the successful completion of Apollo 8, Kranz\u2019s team jumped right into preparations for Apollo 9.", "Riley kept up a running commentary for the benefit of reporters outside the control room and, when Kranz overheard him saying something about \u201clunar landing mission,\u201d it sank in.\nThey were finally going the rest of the way and only Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins had better seats than the people in the control room.\nCharlesworth stayed on duty until after the trans-lunar injection, and then Kranz took over.\nThe crew went into their first sleep cycle during Kranz\u2019s shift and his team only had to keep track of any funnies.\nHe made notes and everything went smoothly for the next few shift rota", "The crew received their \u201cgo\u201d to enter the capsule.\nGrissom plugged his suit into the oxygen supply and immediately reported a sour smell.\nHodge paused the countdown for air sampling and the countdown resumed at 1:25 p.m. Chris Kraft had planned to head up his Red Team for the launch and went down to the MCC for the planned handover.\nHodge decided to hang around in case the test dragged on as it had for some of the plugs-in work.\nSome intermittent communications problem gave Kraft\u2019s team headaches and caused Grissom to growl, \u201cHow can we get to the moon if we can\u2019t even talk between two buildings?\u201d They could have called it a day, but decided to give it another hour.", "Glenn was troubleshooting some attitude control problems while Mission Control tried to make sense of the data they were getting from the remote sites.\nOnly about half those sites were seeing the Segment 51.\nSome of the design techs suggested making sure the landing bag switch was off and asking Glenn whether he had heard any banging noises when he maneuvered.\nWalt Williams and two of the designers joined Chris Kraft at his console and suggested leaving the retropack on during reentry in the hope it would keep the heat shield in place.", "Pretty soon, pictures of Refsmmat were hanging in strategic locations around Mission Control and scribbled on by appreciative members of the team who saw it as a safe place to express their thoughts.\nCaptain Refsmmat stuck around for the rest of Apollo and Skylab.\nBeing an observer was rough on Kranz and he spent a lot of time roaming the halls of Mission Control, plugging his headset in where he could.\nIt was a big relief when the TLI burn that would send Apollo 8 out of Earth orbit and on a path to the Moon came off successfully.\nThree days later, Apollo 8 would be swinging around to the far side of the moon for the first time.", "\u201cThey had a fire on the launchpad.\nThey think the crew is dead!\u201d Kranz turned on the TV to see what the reporters had found out so far.\nIt wasn\u2019t much.\nChris Kraft had acted quickly to lock down Mission Control so they could investigate.\nEnvisioning explosions and an inferno that consumed the entire pad, he rushed to the Center and had trouble finding a parking space.\nEvery available controller was reporting in to see what they could do to help.\nThe controllers still in the control room were too stunned to say much.\nThose still capable of focusing were going over data at their stations.\nMost of the rest were milling around, trying to make sense of the tragedy.", "Hodge started the meeting with a briefing that included the information they knew so far.\nThen, Kranz took the podium.\nHe had gone from shock to anger and wanted to say something that would snap the people out of their own shock.\nHe had not planned a speech, but the words seemed to flow naturally anyway.\n\u201cSpaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity and neglect.\nSomewhere, somehow, we screwed up.\nIt could have been in design, build or test.\nWhatever it was, we should have caught it.\n\u201cWe were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw in each day of our work.", "\u201cYou have your orders, young man!\u201d If Kraft had his way, Hunter wasn\u2019t going to have much of a future in Mission Control.\nAt the customary party on the evening before the launch, the tension between Kraft, Kranz and Slayton had spread to the rest of the controllers and the astronauts and there was none of the usual mingling.\nLlewellyn had too much to drink and tried to start a fight with Alan Shepard.\nKranz intervened and got him out of there.\nThe Gemini 3 crew, Gus Grissom and John Young, had been unaware of trouble before the party but it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out that something was up.\nKranz decided that this was no way to run a mission.", "Problems developed in the thrusters and seat tests and Kraft dived into the task of insuring that the control team was ready for any contingency.\nHe was still the senior flight director and gave Kranz the authority to do the same with his team.\nKranz assured him that he was already on the job.\nThen, Kranz got his first real test in his new role of flight director when Kraft became practically bedridden with influenza six days before the launch.\nThe job of handling the final simulation, pad tests and pre-launch briefings fell on Kranz\u2019s lap.", "\u201cIt was gruesome,\u201d was all John Hodge could get out.\nChris Kraft was on the phone with Deke Slayton.\nSlayton described fire spewing out from inside the capsule and molten metal running down the sides.\nThere was nothing more they could do for the crew.\nThey had lost three pilots in the worst way imaginable, in a ground test that shouldn\u2019t have been much of a risk.\nMost thought it had taken only seconds.\nIt was a harsh reminder of the hazards of space flight.\nKranz organized a meeting of his branch and flight control team in a nearby auditorium.\nAt Hodge\u2019s request, he also included the civil servants, Philco controllers and spacecraft contractors.", "\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been benched.\u201d Von Ehrenfried filled in as assistant flight director and did fine.\nJust before Cooper\u2019s flight, he got a local hospital to provide an electrocardiogram of somebody having a heart attack, fed it into the simulation, and stood back and laughed up his sleeve while the physicians tried to figure it out.\nThat taught the physicians that an astronaut might not have time for doctors to argue over the diagnosis.\nBrooks became notorious for his challenging simulations.\nKranz\u2019s family was still growing.\nMarta gave birth to their fourth child, a boy, and the residents of Flight Controller Alley ganged up on Kranz to send him to her side while she was in labor.", "Cliff Charlesworth\u2019s Green Team got the crew on their way at 7:51 EST on December 21.\nLike many of the Gemini controllers had been, some of the members of his team were fresh out of college and Llewellyn couldn\u2019t resist playing a joke on one of them.\nOne of the youngsters asked about a controller who had visited the coffee station ahead of them.\nLlewellyn retorted, \u201cSheeet, man, that\u2019s Captain Refsmmat, the ideal flight controller!\u201d Refsmmat was Trench shorthand for \u201creference to stable member matrix.\u201d The rookie controller fell for it and \u201cCaptain Refsmmat\u201d became the mascot for the Trench.", "Shepard was even less patient and barked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fix your little problem and light this candle?\u201d And then the most astonishing routine came over the communications loop.", "The walls of the LM were so thin that a good poke with a pencil would have punched a hole right through them.\nThey wouldn\u2019t have worked in an atmosphere and were so ungainly-looking that the astronauts called the training version \u201cflying bedsteads.\u201d It was a good chance to try out a few new controllers who had come on board since Gemini.\nKranz would need them.\nThree days before the launch, LM control engineer got into a traffic accident on his way to work.\nWhile he was still able to cover the actual launch, he was unable to move his upper body and could only communicate with the help of fellow controller Bob Carlton.", "There was a chance that Kranz would have to step into Kraft\u2019s place for the launch and he was so nervous that he clipped out a Sports Illustrated picture of a woman in a swimsuit for emotional support.\nKraft recovered enough to cover the actual launch and Kranz stepped back to his original role of insuring that the control teams and data network were ready.\nIt was one of the few unmanned shots covered by reporters in the control room and Kranz thought it was a bit much for an unmanned suborbital shot that had become nearly routine in the Mercury days.\nThere were so many cameras in the room that a fuse blew, plunging them into darkness.\nThis was where blindfold drills came in handy.", "But, as it turned out, the launch pad crew were piping it into Shepard\u2019s spacecraft in an attempt to get him to lighten up.\nIt certainly added to the surreal feeling and got grins from a few people in Mission Control.", "Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White and Chaffee.\nThese words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.\u201d The official investigation would reveal that the fire had started somewhere near Gus Grissom\u2019s seat.\nThere was some speculation that Grissom could have done something to cause the fire, which the controllers and engineers who were most involved in the project thought was pure nonsense.\nThe fire had started in an area that Grissom couldn\u2019t reach from his seat, even by accident.", "Simulated missions were one thing the mission controllers had in common with the astronauts.\nBrooks would throw every imaginable scenario at them to see how they handled it.\nOne time, the simulation supervisor (SimSup) decided Kraft was depending too much on Kranz and pulled him off.\n\u201cKranz had an accident on the way to MCC and is in the hospital,\u201d SimSup told Kraft.\nKranz protested, \u201cWhat are you doing?\nWe have a mission to prepare for!\u201d Kraft was amused.", "The team\u2019s performance went downhill from there.\nIt got so bad that Chris Kraft gave Kranz a call.\n\u201cI listened to your runs today.\nSounds like you had a tough time.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kranz assured his boss that his team was only having a bad day and would get through it with more training and revisions of the mission rules.\nThings did improve for a while.\nA readiness review on June 17 revealed only one issue that sparked a debate that would last until the week before the launch.\nChris Kraft brought up the issue of landing data rules.\nMost controllers had made a bad call based on faulty telemetry data at some point during training.", "Wally Schirra had brought along signs that read, \u201cDeke Slayton, are you a turtle?\u201d and \u201cBeat Army.\u201d Deke Slayton at the Capcom position recorded his answer and Gemini 7 shot back, \u201cOh, Wally has a sign.\nIt says \u2018Beat Navy.\n'\u201d Since it was the Christmas season, Gemini 6 couldn\u2019t resist reporting a UFO apparently originating at the North Pole.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a large module being pulled by eight smaller modules, moving rapidly from north to south.\nThere\u2019s a man in a red suit inside.\u201d Wally Schirra played \u201cJingle Bells\u201d on a harmonica with Tom Stafford accompanying him with a string of bells to the sniggers in Mission Control.\nOf course, the \u201cUFO\u201d would be driven by Santa Claus.", "With that done, Chris Kraft turned the flight director\u2019s chair over to Gene Kranz.\n\u201cYoung man, it\u2019s yours.\u201d Kranz donned his white vest for the first time to a mixed reaction.\nVon Ehrenfried rolled his eyes and couldn\u2019t resist needling his boss.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, they\u2019re going to haul you away and then I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d The needling didn\u2019t stop there.\nKranz suddenly found himself the center of the closed-circuit TV cameras and several controllers commented, \u201cNice vest, Flight!\u201d The next day, pictures of Kranz in his spiffy white vest were featured in newspapers across the country.", "The Apollo program director had been complaining about the MCC\u2019s readiness and especially their computer systems, so Kraft sent a memo to Kranz telling him to get his systems people to quit their \u201cgold-plating\u201d and justify their requirements.\nKranz sent back a quick acknowledgement and went to get the MCC ready.\nControllers started to arrive for the test at about 11:00 a.m.\nThey were all sick of the amount of testing by this point and John Hodge griped to Kranz, \u201cI sure hope things go well today.\nWe need to get going on our own work.\u201d Kranz just handed over the logbook, went down to his office to get a little work done, and then knocked off early to beat the rush hour traffic.", "Rescue personnel found an annoyed Carpenter munching on a candy bar.\nCarpenter was heard to comment, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d That made Llewellyn mad.\n\u201cThat SOB is lucky to be alive.\u201d From then on, whenever someone wanted to get Llewellyn to tell the story, all they had to do was repeat the line, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d Kranz felt that a combination of a distracted crewman, too many scientific experiments, and ground crew taking too long to remind him of checklists had almost cost them an astronaut.\nThey had gotten lucky, but Kranz wanted to eliminate luck as a factor in future space flights.", "Pencils tapped on desks and, during one delay, Kraft asked Kranz to get him a pint of milk from the lunch wagon to help calm his stomach.", "It turned out to be a mistake.\nSimSup had \u201cCase Number 26\u201d loaded into the simulation computers and told his men, \u201cOK, gang, let\u2019s see how much they know about program alarms.\u201d The GUIDO, Steve Bales, spotted a 1201 alarm on his readouts.\nHe had to look it up in an index file.\n\u201c1201-Executive Overflow-No vacant areas.\u201d For some reason, the computer was receiving more data than it could handle and had gone through a restart cycle.\nMission rules told him nothing, so he checked with his computer expert.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a BAILOUT alarm.\nThe computer is busier than hell and has run out of time to get all the work done.\u201d Still clueless, he watched the computer go through some more restarts.", "They wanted to save the EVA for the next day.\nConsidering the circumstances, this was the equivalent of canceling it altogether.\nCapCom looked to Kranz for direction and a relieved Kranz gave him a thumbs-up.\n\u201cFlight concurs.\u201d Kranz had recently been offered a chance to return to test flight and would likely have done so if they had gone ahead with the plan to release the shroud.\nHe had dodged a bullet.\nCernan went on to make the planned EVA.\nEven without going over to the Agena, it was a surprisingly tough job and he wore himself out just getting to the backpack stowed in a compartment outside the Gemini.\nHe was drenched with sweat and the evaporation fogged up his visor, blinding him.", "Wally Schirra and Tom Stafford were up bright and early on launch day and went through the traditional launch routine that included a \u201clow-residue\u201d breakfast, a medical checkup, and suiting up for the ride.\nThe countdown went smoothly.\nThere were two abort controls that could be activated if there was trouble.\nOne was in Mission Control between booster engineer Charlie Harlan and CapCom C.C.\nWilliams.\nThe other was in the Gemini, located where Wally Schirra could grab and yank it.", "Glynn Lunney oversaw the launch and handed things over to Gene Kranz.\nThings seemed to be proceeding smoothly so far.\nThen, Schirra reported that he had developed a cold and taken an Aspirin.\nLuckily, they had Kleenex on board though Schirra reported that he had to blow pretty hard to clear his nostrils.\nThe flight surgeon recommended a decongestant.\nHis crewmates caught his cold and it did nothing for the mood of any of them.\nBy the third day, Schirra\u2019s bad temper was obvious enough for newspapers to comment, \u201cCaptain Awakes Grumpy.\u201d He curtly vetoed the TV show, leaving an embarrassed PR staff to explain that one to the press.", "The people in Mission Control wished he had reported it sooner.\nThough the astronauts and NASA medical staff had never gotten along, the flight surgeon could have helped.\nIt certainly didn\u2019t help Scweickart\u2019s reputation or the image of the tough astronaut.\nFortunately, he was still able to perform most of the work.\nTests of the Spider\u2018s thrusters and descent engine went well.\nThe next day, Schweickart was feeling well enough to try his EVA.\nRetrieving some science packets from outside the LM wore him out and they decided to call off the planned transfer to the command module.\nThey were ready for the real test.", "Llewellyn got himself into trouble when he went home to sleep.\nWhen he didn\u2019t show for White Team\u2019s next turn in the control room, Kranz had the previous shift\u2019s RETRO give him a call.\nLlewellyn raced to work and, without thinking of the possible consequences, drove his car across the lawn and up the stairs.\nPerhaps he thought he had found the perfect parking place at the building\u2019s main entrance, but security personnel weren\u2019t amused.\nLunney and Hodge had his parking pass suspended and told Kranz, \u201cLlewellyn has got to learn a lesson.", "The launch went smoothly, and then they ran into two alarms at once.\nDPS DELTA V indicated that the thrust hadn\u2019t built up fast enough.\nThey would have to reset the timer.\nThe other one was simply labeled, FORGET IT.\nThis meant that the command to throttle up the engine had not been executed.\nThey extended the mission by an orbit to see if they could still accomplish all their goals.\nSending commands went from being a hassle to being a major problem due to poor signal strength.\nThe controllers ended up punching in commands manually.\nKranz did not want to lose the test of the LM\u2019s abort system, so he decided to ditch all the other tests if he absolutely had to and focus on that one.", "Kraft greeted him with his usual, \u201cHow\u2019s it going, young man?\u201d and Kranz responded with a thumbs-up.", "Luckily, they had spares on hand and they were able to replace it with only a minor delay.\nWalt Williams kept one eye on the weather while they waited.\nWhen the hold was over, Williams started the poll of the controllers, spacecraft and test conductors.", "When he got back, he found out that somebody had come up with an idea of doing an EVA to release the shroud and went down to the ready room to see what he could find out.\nSome of NASA\u2019s top staffers were there.\nKranz considered the plan too risky and had his suspicions about who was behind it.\nBuzz Aldrin was one of the more loudly opinionated astronauts and had picked up the nickname of \u201cDr.\nRendezvous\u201d for his attempts to assist with rendezvous planning.\nHe was in the middle of explaining how the EVA might be done.", "Some of them had to wonder if they were going to face another scrubbed launch.", "Hearing a startled exclamation, \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d from the crew sent adrenaline spikes through the control center.\nThey reported that Snoopy had become a wild dog and they were forced to take manual control to make it up to Charlie Brown.\nThe crew splashed down safely and the concept of having two flight directors proved out well enough to convince Lunney and Charlesworth.\nThe stage was set for the first lunar landing.\nThe Apollo 11 Channel Preparing for Apollo 11 Gene Kranz made Charlesworth the chief flight director for Apollo 11.\nThis meant the leader of the Green Team would be in charge of assigning flight directors for each mission phase.", "The blurbs about the flight directors in the press release said he looked like a poster boy for the Marines.\nThe press ate that one up and, from then on, Kranz felt like he was forever explaining that he was Air Force, not Marines.\nHe found a place at MCC to sleep until the end of the mission.\nIf he needed an assist to wind down, he could go to the doctors for a double shot of whiskey to put in his coffee.\nHe found out fast that whiskey and coffee were not a good combination.\nOther controllers didn\u2019t like the idea of relying on drugs to get to sleep and did without.", "Perhaps someone should have taken the hint.\nThe \u201cplugs-out\u201d test scheduled for January 27, 1967, was considered to be low-risk.\nThe crew were in their pressure suits, in a one hundred percent oxygen atmosphere, and locked in with a newly redesigned hatch that would not blow off by accident.\nThe crew were Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom, Gemini 4 Spacewalker Ed White and a rookie astronaut named Roger Chaffee.\nAt 1:00 pm, they were sealed into the spacecraft.\nKranz volunteered to lead the MCC team participating in this test and was in his office before sunrise.", "The Capcom at the Hawaiian station talked him through the checklist for retrofire.\nIn the meantime, he was still having trouble with the temperature on his pressure suit and, by the end of his third orbit, was starting to show signs of overheating.\nAt one point, Chris Kraft snapped to Gus Grissom at CapCom, \u201cDammit, Gus, keep him on task.\nI think he\u2019s delirious.\u201d Though California gave him the countdown for firing the retro-rockets, Carpenter hit the button three seconds too late.\nHe was going to land somewhere past the planned landing area.", "Other changes to the control room personnel included the addition of Llewellyn at the Retro console, responsible for monitoring the firing of the retro rockets just before reentry.\nLlewellyn would be replacing Carl \u201cDancing Bear\u201d Huss, who was being moved to the Mission Analysis branch to take charge of designing lunar trajectories for what would become the Apollo Program.\nThe launch went off on May 24, 1962 at 7:45:16 EST.\nThe first orbit looked good, with Scott Carpenter reporting that the temperature in his pressure suit was a little high.\nEverything else was nominal, the ground controllers at each remote station were on the ball, and Carpenter made the planned external observations.", "Bob Carlton, dubbed \u201cThe Silver Fox\u201d for his gray hair, became CONTROL, responsible for LM navigation, control and navigation systems.\nAmong other things, he would be responsible for keeping track of how much fuel remained on the LM.\nDon Puddy became TELMU, responsible for communications, power and life support systems.\nHe appointed himself leader of the lunar module team.\nSteve Bales became GUIDO, responsible for guidance systems.\nHe had the black round-rimmed glasses characteristic of his nature as a computer whiz, and had a habit of speaking rapidly.", "That got chuckles from some of the controllers while PR staff howled in outrage at the undignified names.\nThe entire crew caught colds before the launch date of February 28.\nNobody wanted to risk having another sick crew in space, so it was pushed back to March 3, 1969.\nThis was the first actual Apollo launch Kranz would be covering and he had \u201cStars and Stripes Forever\u201d playing in his head as he donned his white vest.\nThe Saturn V was the most powerful rocket built to date and consumed five and a half million pounds of fuel in just over two and a half minutes.\nHe prayed silently during the final seconds of the countdown.\nThe launch came off smoothly.", "To cover it, Mercury Control operated in two shifts for the first time.\nJohn Hodge became flight director for the second shift and Kranz was assigned to his team as assistant flight director.\nKranz had forgiven Cooper for the wild car ride on his first day of work and liked him for his fun-loving spirit.\nHowever, Cooper was not universally popular.\nA few people were hesitant about his Oklahoman accent, which made him sound like a back-waters country boy, and he nearly got yanked from the mission when he rattled nerves by buzzing the control center in a T-38.\nThe launch went off as planned at 8:04 AM EST.", "Kranz worked by feel and the mission came off reasonably well for the fact that they weren\u2019t really prepared for a power failure in the control center.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston adapted its electrical systems so that wouldn\u2019t happen in the future and camera crews were required to provide their own power when covering future space missions.\nTug Of War Even though everybody in NASA had the same goal of going to the Moon, there were frequent disagreements about how to get there and who was in charge of what.\nMission Control got into a tug-of-war with the astronaut office over who, exactly, was in charge of the remote stations.", "Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we.\nThe simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed Daily.\nNothing we did had any shelf life.\nNot one of us stood up and said, \u2018Dammit, stop!\u201cI don\u2019t know what Thompson\u2019s committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find.\nWe are the cause!\nWe were not ready!\nWe did not do our job!\nWe were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when we knew in our hearts it would take a miracle.\nWe were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did.", "Hussappearance and habits reminded many of his colleagues of a bear and, like a bear coming out hibernation, he was slow to wake up.", "Gene Kranz could only think: \u201cWell, let them get on with their great plans.\nI\u2019m gonna put a man in orbit first.\u201d The second suborbital, Liberty Bell 7 manned by Gus Grissom, was nearly a carbon copy of Freedom 7, though the capsule sank and Grissom nearly drowned.\nThe helicopter crews seemed more worried about retrieving the capsule than rescuing Grissom.\nKranz growled to his console, \u201cForget the capsule, just get Gus.\u201d Grissom barely made it out of there by grabbing a line from one of the helicopters.", "While going over the stowage and pre-retro checklists with the Zanzibar CapCom, Cooper reported, \u201cMy automatic control system inverter has failed.\nI\u2019ll have to make a manual reentry.\u201d Zanzibar asked, \u201cHave you tried the standby inverter?\u201d \u201cRoger.\nIt would not start.\u201d They continued with the checklist, and then Cooper made contact with Coastal Sentry: \u201cOh, my automatic inverter failed along with a few other odds and ends.\nI will shoot the retros on manual and then reenter manually also.", "\u201cDammit, Chris, get your guy under control!\u201d snarled Slayton.\nSomehow, they kept it to mere words and talked it out until three in the morning.\nThey cut a deal that would work for the short-term.\nHunter would be in charge of the station, and Conrad would be in charge of real-time operations during the mission.\nKranz had the changes Teletyped out to the remote stations in Carnarval and Hawaii.\nHunter didn\u2019t seem to know when to back down and, the day before Gemini 3 was due to launch, gave Kranz a message to relay to Kraft.\n\u201cThis message doesn\u2019t resolve anything.\nI am going to have it framed and hanged on the wall of my bathroom.\u201d Chris Kraft\u2019s patience was gone.", "Then, shouts from the cockpit sent chills down everybody\u2019s spine.\n\u201cFire!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fire in the cockpit!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bad fire, get us out!\nWe\u2019re burning up.\u201d Then, somebody screamed and they heard nothing else.\nEfforts to get them out took several minutes and they found the crew in a heap next to the hatch.\nThey had obviously been trying to undo it but simply couldn\u2019t in time.\nThe Aftermath Gene Kranz had just gotten dressed for a night out with his wife when he got a knock on the door.\nHe thought it was just the baby-sitter, so he called, \u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming.\u201d He went downstairs and the man at the door was flight controller Jim Hannigan.", "He had to make up his mind.\n\u201cFlight, Guidance.\nSomething is wrong with the computer.\nI\u2019ve got a bunch of computer alarms.\nAbort the landing, abort!\u201d Kranz passed the abort command along to CapCom and it was executed perfectly.\nDick Koos told them, \u201cThat was not an abort.\nYou should have continued the landing.\u201d He skewered both Kranz and Bales for the mistake.\nIt was a lousy way to finish the team\u2019s training.\nSteve Bales was embarrassed and frustrated.", "Twenty minutes sped by fast and both the ground team and McDivitt prompted him to begin thinking about getting back into the spacecraft.\nMcDivitt told him, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get back in here before it gets dark.\u201d White reacted like a kid told to come in for supper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the saddest moment of my life.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re going to find it sadder when we have to come down with this whole thing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d White came back through the hatch and they wrestled to get the hatch closed.\nIt had lost its flexibility in the cold of space.\nMission Control had planned to jettison the now unnecessary EVA gear but decided not to press their luck.", "Things went smoothly at first, with Cooper ticking off his experiments on schedule and the shift change occurring on schedule as Faith 7 was progressing along its sixth orbit.\nHodge had a different approach to mission control than Kraft did.\nKraft was a very hands-on mentor of the young mission controllers and comfortable with his status as team leader.\nHodge tried to obtain a consensus before making a decision, was good with people but didn\u2019t seem quite so comfortable with his leadership role.\nKranz remembered him as a nice guy.", "They sat through five delays and the weather started to foul up.", "The Apollo spacecraft went through a redesign process that included a hatch that could be opened in seconds, a reduction in combustible materials in the spacecraft, a change in the cabin\u2019s atmosphere from pure oxygen to a hydrogen-oxygen mix, and insulated wires that couldn\u2019t cause sparks.\nThough the blame was never pegged on any one person, some of the controllers quit and others suffered breakdowns and were transferred out of Mission Control.\nThose who remained set their minds to picking up the pieces and swore that they would do whatever it took to honor the Apollo 1 crew\u2019s sacrifice and reach the Moon by the end of the decade.", "Mission Control and the remote sites used timed-tagged stored program commands (SPC) to control the unmanned Agena.\nBecause the Agena spacecraft had given them so many problems, nobody was taking any chances that it might misinterpret a command and go wild.\nThe Agena had an error checking routine that helped controllers verify that the command being put in the onboard computer\u2019s memory was the one they had sent.\nAs a backup, the remote site computers performed an echo check by automatically recording each command as it was converted into radio waves and checking it with the intended command load.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of this, but I\u2019m showing an indication of Segment 51.\u201d This was more serious than the President\u2019s phone call.\nSegment 51 was the impact bag deploy.\nIf that had somehow come undone, the heat shield was loose and John Glenn would burn up when he reentered the atmosphere.\nAs they tried to track down the indication, the chief audio technician had the unfortunate duty of telling the president, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten pretty busy down here!\u201d The president answered, \u201cGive me a call when you get the chance.\u201d Some of the readouts suggested that the Segment 51 was a false alarm, but they couldn\u2019t be certain.", "They would hold blindfold drills in which they reached for each switch until they could almost have flown the thing themselves.\nThe art of flight control was continuing to be refined and the control team spent many hours studying schematics and writing flight procedures and mission rules.\nKraft made one change in the job description of the flight director.\nThe description now said: \u201cThe flight director may, after analysis of a flight, take any action necessary for mission success.\u201d This cleared up some vague terms in the previous job description and gave the flight director more leeway in directing the missions.", "During the post-mission debriefing, Kranz got up on the stage and gave a speech about discipline and control.\nThinking back on it years later, Kranz conceded that it was a wonder that more fistfights didn\u2019t break out during the race to the moon.\nReady For EVA?\nWhile celebrating the success of Gemini 3, Kranz heard through the grapevine that the Russians had scored another space first with an EVA by cosmonaut Aleksei Leonov.\nIt seemed like the U.S. couldn\u2019t score a space first for anything and Chris Kraft seemed distracted when Kranz delivered a report on the Gemini 3 mission to his office.\nWhen Kranz finished giving a verbal summary, Kraft walked across his office and closed the door.", "Kranz enjoyed the early-morning silence and the searchlights in the distance assured him that the countdown was still running.", "The LM was in good shape and Dave Scott reported that it looked good on his end, so Kranz gave them the go for separation.\nThe descent propulsion system quickly moved the Spider away from Gumdrop and Scott reported that he could see it to a distance of fifty miles.\nThey kept going out to one hundred miles.\nThe Spider\u2018s crew now had to reverse course and head back to the Gumdrop.\nThis meant firing the ascent engine as if they were returning from the moon.\nIf it didn\u2019t work, Dave Scott would have to perform the first space rescue and track them down.\nThe Spider successfully flew back to the point where Scott could dock with them again.\nThe highlights of the mission were a success.", "Then, Kraft was distracted by some issues with the worldwide data network and Kranz moved on.\nKranz described the moment when he heard Shepard had entered his spacecraft as \u201csurreal.\u201d This was the moment they had all waited for since signing up.", "Mission Control believed otherwise.\nKranz, in particular, felt that the astronautsproper role at the remote sites was as observers and assistants.\nFive days before the launch of the first manned Gemini, Astronauts Pete Conrad and Neil Armstrong went out to the remote sites at Carnarvon and Hawaii, respectively.\nOnce Pete Conrad got to Carnarvon, he encountered Dan Hunter, who was in charge of the station.\nBoth were equally strong-willed and it would lead to a showdown that would provide greater clarity of the roles of both Mission Control and the Astronaut Office during the flight.\nThe trouble started while Kranz and Kraft were still in Florida after Gemini 2.", "By the time Hodge\u2019s Blue Team took over, they had worked out a plan to power up systems incrementally for the next few days.\nHis team\u2019s handling of the crisis convinced Kranz that he was now a full-fledged flight director and, at the press conference at the end of the shift, he featured Aaron as the real hero for saving the fuel cell.\nThe mission made it almost the full eight days.\nKranz was forced to cut it one orbit short during his final shift so the crew wouldn\u2019t fall into a hurricane during reentry.\nThis gave him a perfect opportunity to pull a fast one on Llewellyn.", "He reported a spectacular sunrise, and then the glittering \u201cfireflies\u201d surrounding his spacecraft.\nThose fireflies would turn out to be drops of frozen water from the spacecraft.\nKraft was less than impressed when Kranz relayed that to him.\n\u201cKeep me advised.\u201d The first orbit came to an end with no problems worse than a slight increase of temperature in the cabin.\nThen, Kraft dropped a bombshell on Kranz: \u201cShorty Powers has confirmed that the President will make a call at the end of the first orbit.\nGet with the communications people and make sure everything is set up.\u201d Kranz didn\u2019t like that very much.", "He stopped the run and reported it.\nEven then, Slayton didn\u2019t expect problems.\nHe had made test flights in the F-105 without any trouble and didn\u2019t expect this to be any more serious.\nIt didn\u2019t turn out that way and Slayton was yanked from the flight.\nNormally, Wally Schirra would have stepped up to the plate as his backup, but they gave the flight to Scott Carpenter instead.\nAt first, Kranz thought Slayton had been pulled off the flight because he complained too much about the experiments he was supposed to perform on the flight.\nWhen he found out the truth, he chalked it up to the fact that if you asked enough experts, you would eventually find one nay-sayer.", "Do you know what it really takes to be an astronaut?\u201d \u201cNo, Jose, tell me.\u201d \u201cYou should have courage and the right blood pressure and four legs.\u201d \u201cWhy four legs, Jose?\u201d \u201cThey were going to send a dog.\nBut they decided that would be too cruel.\u201d Now who in the world would be playing a recording of comedian Bill Dana\u2019s cowardly astronaut routine at a time like this?\nKranz scrambled to find the cause.", "A basic training course for flight controllers was set up.\nThe first class of six spent two weeksworth of twelve-hour days learning learning Morse code and speed printing.\nKranz handed out their flight controllerscertificates himself, and then the first class went out to the remote sites.\nA few of the controllers posted in unfriendly territories like Zanzibar had military experience that served them well when they ran across such obstacles as burning roadblocks and hostile natives.\nSome of the new mission controllers served only one or two missions, decided the responsibility was too much for them, and moved on to other careers.", "He promised Kranz that he would find out what he could and went off to make phone calls to MIT, which had developed the software.\nBy the end of it, they had a new mission rule listing the program alarms that would trigger an abort.\nNeither 1201 or 1202 were among them.\nLaunch of Apollo 11 Gene Kranz was up before sunrise on July 16, 1969.\nHe was even more psyched this day than he was on most launch days and all his wife could do was pack him a lunch and boot him out the door.\nOnce he was in the control room, he only betrayed his nervousness with the constant clicking of his ballpoint pen and sweaty palms that made pages from the logbook curl up.", "Cooper made some celestial observations and took several pictures of Earth and celestial objects during a quiet period in his schedule, and then set a milestone of his own when he became the first American to sleep in orbit.\nHis heart rate dropped low enough to alarm the physicians, who had CapCom wake him briefly to make certain he was okay.\nThe team fell into a mode of relaxed alertness and kept an eye on things until Kraft\u2019s team came back on duty.\nDuring the nineteenth orbit, Cooper\u2019s05 G indicator came on.", "Jose Jimenez.", "Training started eight weeks before the planned launch date.\nThey ran through the planned mission for the first couple of days to identify major Go/NoGo points and get a feel for what a \u201cnormal\u201d mission with no problems would be.\nA new SimSup named Dick Koos continued the tradition of imaginative simulation scripts that helped the control team refine procedures and mission rules.\nNot everything went perfectly.\nThe crew and controllers often trained together and that meant the computer network between the control room and crew simulators needed to stay up and running.\nWhen it didn\u2019t, SimSup had to contend with impatient astronauts and controllers while technicians tried to troubleshoot.", "Borman and Lovell successfully rendezvoused with their own booster and flew in formation for a while.\nThen, they got started on medical experiments.\nThe suits might have been lightweight, but Borman and Lovell had a repeat of Scott Carpenter\u2019s suit heating problems during Aurora 7.\nWhen the crew reached Day 3 with little relief, Lovell stripped off his suit.\nMission Control wanted to let both of them remove their suits when medical data showed that Lovell was sleeping better, but NASA management refused to allow it.\nControl even tried playing the media card and told the press that the crew risked overheating in those suits to no avail.\nBorman and Lovell had to take turns wearing the suits.", "Just call me \u2018Aunt Emma\u2019; certainly some smart people may laugh at my concern, but I just feel that the crew should not be diddling around with the computer keyboard during powered descent unless absolutely necessary.\nThey will never hit a wrong button, of course, but if they do, the results can be really lousy.\u201d Many of his Tindallgram ideas were incorporated into the mission rules, including changing the Go/NoGo decisions to Stay/NoStay for actual lunar activity.\nFor his efforts, Bill Tindall became an honorary flight director with Gray as a team color and Kranz invited Tindall to sit beside him for the lunar landing.", "The goal was to see if the backup team were capable of jumping in if something happened to him.\nDuring the final dress rehearsal for network simulation, Fendell crumpled in a heap as planned.\nIt was such a convincing act that the rest of the Hawaii team were momentarily distracted.\nBucholz plugged into the voice loop to Houston.\n\u201cChris, Fendell just had a heart attack!\u201d Kraft probably remembered the time SimSup had told him that Kranz had gotten into an accident on the way to the Center.\n\u201cIs this your doing, SimSup?\u201d \u201cNot mine, Flight!\u201d Kraft told Hawaii to inform the Houston surgeon of Fendell\u2019s condition and kept his team on task.\nBucholz stepped up to the job beautifully.", "This was critical for planning maneuvers like rendezvous and Gemini 4 was their first real test of their ability to keep track of variables like atmospheric drag.\nKranz\u2019s first shift in Mission Control passed uneventfully and he handed the logbook to John Hodge.\nHe hung his white vest on a hook, his thoughts racing ahead to the news conference he now had to face.\nThough NASA\u2019s public-relations officers were not universally popular and often hated by the astronauts, Gene Kranz thought they really earned their pay when dealing with the press conferences.\nThis press conference did cause one lingering misconception about Kranz.", "His attitude could be abrasive and he didn\u2019t get along well with some of the flight directors.\nKranz thought he did fine as long as he was kept on a short leash.\nCharlie Duke joined the team as Kranz\u2019s CapCom.\nHe integrated with the team so well that Kranz thought that he would have made an excellent flight director.\nWhile establishing the mission rules, Bill Tindall livened things up with his Tindallgrams.\nA typical Tindallgram might read: \u201cThere is another thing about powered descent crew procedures that really bugged me.", "It was questionable whether he could even get into the proper attitude for reentry and he would have to use the fly-by-wire system to keep his spacecraft from tumbling.\nLlewellyn resorted to high school geometry to determine that Carpenter was going to land at least 200 miles long.\nAs Carpenter began coming back into the atmosphere and they lost radio contact, all the people in the control room could do was pray.\nKranz had only felt this kind of helplessness when he held his wife\u2019s hand during childbirth.\nFinally, Grissom caught Carpenter\u2019s report that his chute had deployed and replied that they would get Air Rescue personnel to him within an hour.", "Kraft was convinced it was a false reading and didn\u2019t like that very much.\nWilliams asked, \u201cIf we come in with the retropack attached, what\u2019s the worst that could happen to us?\u201d Kranz could imagine Glenn\u2019s response if he could have heard that question: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018us\u2019?\u201d After a little more discussion, it was decided that they would keep an eye on it, but not to tell John Glenn because they didn\u2019t want to worry him.\nLeaving the retropack on could work, but only if all three retro rockets fired on time.\nIf they didn\u2019t, there was a chance one of the rockets could go off during reentry and kill Glenn.\nThe last orbit was the worst.", "If the shroud hadn\u2019t opened fully, they might not be able to dock but that was a secondary objective.\nA failure in the ground support equipment forced them to scrub the Gemini launch for two days.\nMarta made a special vest with gold and silver brocade over the familiar white for the next launch attempt.\nIt made an impression on visitors on June 3 and Kraft even made a few kidding comments.\nIt may have been a good luck charm.\nEither way, the launch was successful that day.\nThe crew rendezvoused with the ATDA on the third orbit and confirmed Mission Control\u2019s suspicions about the shroud.", "It was only partly open and held in place by a band.\n\u201cIt looks like an angry alligator,\u201d reported Stafford.\nMission Control sent several rapid maneuver commands in an attempt to jettison the shroud with no luck.\nIn the meantime, the Gemini left the Agena, orbited Earth one more time, and returned for a second rendezvous.\nA brainstorming session by the ATDA team failed to come up with any workable ideas.\nStafford suggested using the nose of the Gemini to nudge the shroud off and Kranz was quick to veto that idea.\nFor the time being, Kranz\u2019s team gave up on trying to get the shroud off.\nKranz went home for supper and to get some fresh clothes to bring back to MCC quarters.", "This was the controllersfavorite bar, where they celebrated successes and mourned losses.\nFor a little while, it looked like Gemini 6 wasn\u2019t going to happen.\nThen, somebody had an inspired idea.\nGemini 7 was going to go up before too long.\nWhy not make it the target vehicle for the Gemini 6 rendezvous?\nThough neither side in the Space Race had mastered rendezvous yet, the Russians had already demonstrated their capacity for running two missions at once.\nCould the Americans do the same?\nThey were certainly going to find out and Gemini 6 and 7 came to be known collectively as Gemini 7/6.", "He walked into Kranz\u2019s office and spent a moment looking out the window before turning to Kranz with a smile.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to decide on the Apollo 11 phase assignments.\nI think I should launch Apollo 11 and do the EVA.\nMilt Windler will take the entry.\nThis leaves Glynn with the lunar ascent and you with the landing.\nIs this okay with you?\u201d Kranz agreed and, with that done, Charlesworth left his office.\nKranz promptly called home to share the good news with his wife, and then called his staff in.\nThere was no way he could sit still and perhaps they guessed the good news from the way he was pacing around his office.\nHe chose his landing team quickly.", "Kranz was so excited that, when he left his station to go over to the Teletype machine, he forgot to remove his headset.\nThe cord snagged a chair and knocked it over.\nHe picked it up just as Shepard made his thirty-second report.\nThe Freedom 7 reached an apogee of 116 miles and Shepard tested roll, pitch and yaw manuevers as planned.\nThis assured the doctors whom Kranz considered too conservative that humans could function in space.", "The Americans scored their second space first when Armstrong reported, \u201cWe\u2019re docked, no noticeable oscillations, very smooth.\u201d Everything seemed to be going well, though CapCom Jim Lovell decided that Armstrong and Scott should be informed of the failed load comparison.\nA military coup in Zanzibar had forced NASA to move the remote station over to Madagascar and Gemini 8 was making a pass over it when Lovell told them, \u201cIf the Agena attitude control system goes wild, just send the command to turn it off and take control of the spacecraft.\u201d Everything looked normal when Gemini 8 flew into a zone of no coverage.", "This would have meant that he had started reentry, but Cooper believed it was a false reading and disabled the fuses leading to it.\nThis disabled an automatic system that would have been used for retrofire.\nCooper would have to fire the retro rockets manually.\nKranz made sure the new plans went out to the remote stations and set up backup communications with John Glenn, the capcom on the Coastal Sentry.\nIt may have occurred to the control team that part of the reason Scott Carpenter had landed so far out of the planned recovery area was that he had fired the retros a few seconds late, but that was the biggest concern.", "FIDO was a New Yorker named Jay Greene who took on the self-appointed role of coaching Kranz in the trajectory work needed to land on the moon.\nRETRO was a cocky Trench veteran named Chuck Deiterich.\nHe had a bad habit of giving Flight either too much or too little information, once even giving Kranz some cheek: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear about that.\nIt\u2019s too technical.\u201d Ed Fendell took on a position that involved consolidating communications between the CSM and LM.\nIt was his idea to use the command module as a communications relay if they couldn\u2019t get a direct connection with the lunar module.", "The command was sent up and Kranz heard the welcome news from Carlton: \u201cFire-in-the-hole, abort stage, we are stable!\u201d Their struggles with the commands had done some damage to the LM but they accomplished all the important objectives.\nBecause of their success, newspapers were able to report the happy news: \u201cApollo Mission A Success, Lunar Program On Track!\u201d Apollo 6 was less than successful due to failed rocket engines.\nIn August 1968, Flight Control Division chief John Hodge was abruptly transferred out to study post-Apollo options, leaving Kranz in charge."]
