generally requires a judicially sanctioned warrant because the basic rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and \" searches conducted outside the judicial process without prior approval by judge or magistrate are per se unreasonable \"\nIn order for such a warrant to be considered reasonable it must be supported by probable cause and be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a person ( usually a law enforcement officer ) who has sworn by it and is therefore accountable to the issuing court\nThe Supreme Court further held in Chandler v. Miller ( 1997 ) : \" To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment a search ordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing\nBut particularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes warranted based on ' special needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement '\n...\nWhen such ' special needs ' are alleged courts must undertake a context @-@ specific inquiry examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties \"\nThe amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures but not those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on behalf of a government\nIn Ontario v.
