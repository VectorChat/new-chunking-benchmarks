Cultura.\nwritten about 160 BCE by Roman statesman Cato the Elder ( 234 \u2013 149 BCE ) in a list that includes 120 kinds ( cultivars ) of figs grapes apples and olives\nThe names are presented in a way that implies that they would have been familiar to fellow Romans\nThe \" cultivar \" names were mostly of one word and denoted the provenance of the cultivar ( the geographical origin of the place where the plant selections were made )\nWriters up to the 15th century added little to this early work\nIn the Middle Ages the book of hours early herbals illuminated manuscripts and economic records indicate that plants grown by the Romans found their way into monastery gardens\nFor example in 827 CE the following herbs were mentioned in the poem Hortulus by Walafrid Strabo as growing in the monastery garden of St Gallen in Switzerland : sage rue southernwood wormwood horehound fennel German iris lovage chervil Madonna lily opium poppy clary mint betony agrimony catmint radish gallica rose bottle gourd and melon\nIt seems likely that aromatic and culinary herbs were quite widespread and similar lists of plants occur in records of plants grown in Villa gardens at the time of Charlemagne ( 742 \u2013 814 CE )", "The nearest railway stations are in March and Manea", "In 1700 French botanist J.P. de Tournefort although still using the broad groupings of \" trees \" and \" herbs \" for flowering plants began to use flower characteristics as distinguishing features and most importantly provided a clear definition of the genus as a basic unit of classification\nIn Institutiones Rei Herbariae he listed about 10 @,@ 000 different plants which he called species organised into 698 genera with illustrations\nThe establishment of this precursor of scientific classification vastly improved the organisation of plant variation into approximately equivalent groups or ranks and many of his genera were later taken up by Carl Linnaeus\nThere was still at this time no common agreement on the way to present plant names so they ranged in length from one word to lengthy descriptive sentences\nAs the number of recorded plants increased this naming system became more unwieldy", "The 2001 Census found that 6 @,@ 596 ( 74 @.\n@ 8 % ) of people in the town stated Christian to be their religion with 54 ( 0 @.\n@ 6 % ) of other religions and 2163 ( 24 @.\n@ 5 % ) as having no religion", "The Mayer \u2013 Vietoris sequence holds for a variety of cohomology and homology theories including singular homology and singular cohomology\nIn general the sequence holds for those theories satisfying the Eilenberg \u2013 Steenrod axioms and it has variations for both reduced and relative ( co ) homology\nBecause the ( co ) homology of most spaces cannot be computed directly from their definitions one uses tools such as the Mayer \u2013 Vietoris sequence in the hope of obtaining partial information\nMany spaces encountered in topology are constructed by piecing together very simple patches\nCarefully choosing the two covering subspaces so that together with their intersection they have simpler ( co ) homology than that of the whole space may allow a complete deduction of the ( co ) homology of the space\nIn that respect the Mayer \u2013 Vietoris sequence is analogous to the Seifert \u2013 van Kampen theorem for the fundamental group and a precise relation exists for homology of dimension one", "1930 Intensive breeding and selection programs = = = 1900 to 1950 \u2013 the Botanical Code and cultigen nomenclature = = =", "This Article making provision for the cultigens of horticultural nomenclature was to remain in the Botanical Code ( with a minor amendment in 1935 suggesting the use of the letter ' c ' before the horticultural name and antedating formal recognition of the cultivar ) through 1906 1912 and 1935 until the separation in 1953 of the Horticultural Code precursor to the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ( Cultivated Plant Code )\nIn 1900 there was the first International Botanical Congress and in 1905 at the second Congress in Vienna an agreed set of nomenclatural rules was established the Vienna Rules which became known from then on as the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature ( now the International Code of Nomenclature for algae fungi and plants )\nAfter World War II the responsibility for the Botanical Code was taken up by the International Association for Plant Taxonomy and meetings to discuss revisions are held at six @-@ yearly intervals the latest being in 2005"]
