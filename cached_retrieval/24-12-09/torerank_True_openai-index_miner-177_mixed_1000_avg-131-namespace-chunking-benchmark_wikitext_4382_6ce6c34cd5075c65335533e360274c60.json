["Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central questions : what government activities constitute \" search \" and \" seizure \" ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed\nEarly court decisions limited the amendment 's scope to a law enforcement officer 's physical intrusion onto private property but with Katz v.

Bostick ( 1991 ) the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required the police contact is a \" citizen encounter \" that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment", "Under Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances\nIn Terry the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses \" unusual conduct \" that leads that officer to reasonably believe \" that criminal activity may be afoot \" that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others the officer may conduct a \" pat @-@ down search \" ( or \" frisk \" ) to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon", "Where society 's need is great no other effective means of meeting the need is available and intrusion on people 's privacy is minimal certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists\nIn United States v.

Jones ( 2012 ) the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law but rather has supplemented it\nIn Jones law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car 's exterior without Jones ' knowledge or consent", "If a person is not under suspicion of illegal behavior a law enforcement official is not allowed to place an individual under arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the case\nA search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment so long as the arresting officer has probable cause\nIn Maryland v. King ( 2013 ) the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for DNA upon arrests for serious crimes along the same reasoning that allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest and detain", "In Carroll v. United States ( 1925 ) the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible common @-@ sense standard\nTo that end the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States ( 1925 ) that the term probable cause means \" less than evidence that would justify condemnation \" reiterating Carroll 's assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would \" warrant a man of reasonable caution \" in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime\nIt does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false", "However the officer must have had probable cause to believe that the objects are contraband\nSimilarly \" open fields \" such as pastures open water and woods may be searched without a warrant on the ground that conduct occurring therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy\nThe doctrine was first articulated by the Court in Hester v.

Royer ( 1983 ) such a search must be temporary and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop ( e.g.\n, officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car cannot after confirming that it is not stolen compel the person to answer questions about anything else such as the possession of contraband )", "Because the Bill of Rights did not initially apply to the states and federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century of the nation 's history there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century\nThe amendment was held to apply to the states in Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 )\nUnder the Fourth Amendment search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it", "In Schneckloth v.
