["Then Psyche, though enfeebled in both body and mind, gained the strength lent her by fate's harsh decree.\nShe uncovered the lamp, seized the razor, and showed a boldness that belied her sex.\nBut as soon as the lamp was brought near, and the secrets of the couch were revealed, she beheld of all beasts the gentlest and sweetest, Cupidos [Eros] himself, a handsome god lying in a handsome posture.\nEven the lamplight was cheered and brightened on sighting him, and the razor felt suitable abashed at its sacrilegious sharpness.\nAs for Psyche, she was awe-struck at this wonderful vision, and she lost all her self-control.\nShe swooned and paled with enervation; her knees buckled, and she sought to hide the steel by plunging it into her own breast.", "But her jealous sisters made her believe that in the darkness of night she was embracing some hideous monster, and accordingly once, while Amor was asleep, she approached him with a lamp, and, to her amazement, she beheld the most handsome and lovely of the gods.\nIn her excitement of joy and fear, a drop of hot oil fell from her lamp upon his shoulder.\nThis awoke Amor, who censured her for her mistrust, and escaped.\nPsyche's peace was now gone all at once, and after having attempted in vain to throw herself into a river, she wandered about from temple to temple, inquiring after her beloved, and at length came to the palace of Venus.\nThere her real sufferings began, for Venus retained her, treated her as a slave, and inmposed upon her the hardest and most humiliating labours.", "At once the pain caused him to start from his sleep, and when he saw me wielding the steel and the flame, he said : \"This is a dreadful deed you have done.\nLeave my bed this instant, and take your goods and chattels with you.\nI shall now take your sister\"--at this point he cited your name specifically--\"in solemn marriage.\"\nAt once he then ordained Zephyrus to waft me outside the bounds of his estate.Psyche had not yet finished speaking when her sister, goaded by mad lust and destructive envy, swung into action.\nShe devised a lying excuse to deceive her husband, pretending that she had learnt of her parents' death; she at once boarded ship, and then made hot-foot for the rock.", "\u2018You recall that plan of yours, by which you both persuaded me to take a two-edged razor and slay the beast who used to lie with me falsely claiming to be my husband, with the intention of later devouring my poor self with his greedy maw?\nI fell in with your proposal, but when the lamp which conspired with me allowed me to gaze on his face, the vision I beheld was astonishing and utterly divine; it was the son of the goddess Venus [Aphrodite], I mean Cupidos [Eros] himself, who lay peacefully sleeping there.\nI exulted at the sight of such beauty, and was confused by the sense of overwhelming delight, and as I experienced frustration at being unable to enjoy relations with him, the lamp by dreadful mischance shed a drop of burning oil on his shoulder.", "The rest of his body, hairless and rosy, and was such that Venus [Aphrodite] would not have been ashamed to acknowledge him as her son.\nAt the foot of the bed lay his bow, quiver, and arrows, the kindly weapons of that great god.\nAs Psyche trained her gaze insatiably and with no little curiosity on these her husband's weapons, in the course of handling and admiring them she drew out an arrow from the quiver, and tested its point on the tip of her thumb.\nBut because her arm was still trembling she pressed too hard, with the result that it pricked too deeply, and tiny drops of rose-red blood bedewed the surface of the skin.\nSo all unknowing and without prompting Psyche fell in love with Amor (Love) [Eros], being fired more and more with desire for the god of desire.", "While Psyche was at this time visiting one community after another in her concentrated search for Cupidos [Eros], he was lying groaning in his mother's chamber, racked by the pain of the wound from the lamp.\nBut then the tern, the white bird which wings her way over the sea-waves, plunged swiftly into the deep bosom of ocean.\nShe came upon Venus [Aphrodite] conveniently there as the goddess bathed and swam; she perched beside her, and told her that her son had suffered burning, and was lying in considerable pain from the wound, with his life in danger.", "At that moment her husband came to bed somewhat earlier than usual.\nShe was still weeping, and as he embraced her, he remonstrated with her : \u2018Is this how the promise you made me has turned out, Psyche, my dear?\nWhat is your husband to expect or to hope from you?\nYou never stop torturing your self night and day, even when we embrace each other as husband and wife.\nVery well, have it your own way, follow your own hell-bound inclination.\nBut when you begin to repent at leisure, remember the sober warning which I gave you.Then Psyche with prayers and threats of her impending death forced her husband to yield to her longing to see her sisters, to relieve their grief, and he also allowed her to present them with whatever pieces of gold or jewellery she chose.", "She gazed down on him in distraction, and as she passionately smothered him with wanton kisses from parted lips, she feared that he might stir in his sleep.\nBut while her wounded heart pounded on being roused by such striking beauty, the lamp disgorged a drop of burning oil from the tip of its flame upon the god's right shoulder; it could have been nefarious treachery, or malicious jealousy, or the desire, so to say, to touch and kiss that glorious body.\nO you rash, reckless lamp, Amor's (Love's) worthless servant, do you burn the very god who possesses all fire, though doubtless you were invented by some lover to ensure that he might possess for longer and even at night the object of his desire?\nThe god started up on being burnt; he saw that he was exposed, and that his trust was defiled.", "She eagerly counted the mounting days and departing months, and as a novice bearing an unknown burden, she marvelled that the pinprick of a moment could cause such a lovely swelling in her fecund womb.\nBut now those baneful, most abhorrent Furiae (Furies) [Erinyes] were hastening on their impious way aborad ship, exhaling their snakelike poison.\nIt was then that Psyche's husband on his brief visit again warned her : \u2018This is the day of crisis, the moment of worst hazard.\nThose troublesome members of your sex, those hostile blood-relations of yours have now seized their arms, struck camp, drawn their battle-line, and sounded the trumpet-note.\nYour impious sisters have drawn their swords, and are aiming at your jugular.\nThe calamities that oppress us are indeed direful, dearest Psyche.", "I am told that it is your practice to lend unsolicited aid to pregnant women in danger.As she prayed like this, Juno [Hera] at once appeared before her in all the venerable majesty of her divinity.\nThere and then the goddess said : \u2018Believe me, I only wish that I could crown your prayers with my consent.\nBut shame prevents me from opposing the will of Venus [Aphrodite], my daughter-in-law whom I have always loved as my own daughter.\nThere is a second obstacle--the legislation which forbids sanctuary for runaway slaves belonging to others, if their owners forbid it.Psyche was aghast at this second shipwreck devised by Fortuna (Fortune).\nUnable to meet up with her elusive husband, she abandoned all hope of salvation, and had recourse to her own counsel.\n\u2018What other assistance can I seek or harness to meet my desperate plight?", "In view of this, you must now decide whether you ware willing to side with your sisters, who are anxious for your welfare which is so dear to their hearts, and to live in their company once you escape from death, or whether you prefer to be interred in the stomach of that fiercest of beasts.\nHowever, if you opt for the isolation of this rustic haunt inhabited only by voices, preferring the foul and hazardous intimacy of furtive love in the embrace of this venomous Dragon, at any rate we as your devoted sisters will have done our duty.Poor Psyche, simple and innocent as she was, at once felt apprehension at these grim tidings.\nShe lost her head, and completely banished her recollection of all her husband's warnings and her own promises.\nShe launched herself into the abyss of disaster.", "Make your way back with it as early as you can, because I need it to doll myself up so as to attend the Deities' Theatre.Then Psyche came to the full realization that this was the end of the road for her.\nAll pretence was at an end; she saw clearly that she was being driven to her immediate doom.\nIt could not be otherwise, for she was being forced to journey on foot of her own accord to Tartarus and the shades below.\nShe lingered no longer, but made for a very high tower, intending to throw herself headlong from it, for she thought that this was the direct and most glorious route down to the world below.\nBut the tower suddenly burst into speech, and said : \u2018Pour girl, why do you seek to put an end to yourself by throwing yourself down?", "So if those depraved witches turn up later, ready with their destructive designs, and I am sure they will, you must not exchange a single word with them, or at any rate if your native innocence and soft-heartedness cannot bear that, you are not to listen to or utter a single word about your husband.\nSoon we shall be starting a family, for this as yet tiny womb of yours is carrying for us another child like yourself.\nIf you conceal our secret in silence, that child will be a god; but if you disclose it, he will be mortal.Psyche was aglow with delight at the news.\nShe gloried in the comforting prospect of a divine child, she exulted in the fame that such a dear one would bring her, she rejoiced at the thought of the respected status of mother.", "They guided the conversation towards the deceitful snare which they had laid, and they began to enquire innocently about the status, family background, and walk of life of her husband.\nThen Psyche's excessive naivety made her forget her earlier version, and she concocted a fresh story.\nShe said that her husband was a business-man from an adjoining region, and that he was middle-aged, with streaks of grey in his hair.\nBut she did not linger a moment longer in such talk, but again loaded her sisters with rich gifts, and ushered them back to their carriage of the wind.\nEros-Cupid and Psychae, Greco-Roman mosaic from Daphne C3rd A.D., Hatay Archaeology Museum \"But as they returned home, after Zephyrus with his serene breath had borne them aloft, they

what you're doing!\u2019, or \u2018What's your game?\nLookout!\u2019, or \u2018Cut and run!\u2019, or \u2018You won't make it!The hopelessness of the situation turned Psyche to stone.\nShe was physically present, but her senses deserted her.\nShe was utterly downcast by the weight of inescapable danger; she could not even summon the ultimate consolation of tears.\nBut the privations of this innocent soul did not escape the steady gaze of benevolent Providentia (Providence).", "But inside there was no beauty-lotion or anything other than the sleep of Hades, a truly Stygian sleep.\nAs soon as the lid was removed and it was laid bare, it attacked her and pervaded all her limbs in a thick cloud.\nIt laid hold of her, so that she fell prostrate on the path where she had stood.\nShe lay there motionless, no more animate than a corpse at rest.\nBut Cupidos was now recovering for his wound had healed.\nHe could no longer bear Psyche's long separation from him, so he glided out of the high-set window of the chamber which was his prison.\nHis wings were refreshed after their period of rest, so he progressed much more swiftly to reach his Psyche.\nCarefully wiping the sleep from her, he restored it to its former lodging in the box.", "Take pity on yourself and on me; show dutiful self-control to deliver your house and your husband, your person and this tiny child of ours from the unhappy disaster that looms over us.\nDo not set eyes on, or open your ears to, these female criminals, whom you cannot call your sisters because of their deadly hatred, and because of the way in which they have trodden underfoot their own flesh and blood, when like Sireni they lean out over the crag, and make the rocks resound with the death-dealing cries!Psyche's response was muffled with tearful sobs.\n\u2018Some time ago, I think, you had proof of my trustworthiness and discretion, and on this occasion too my resolution will likewise win your approval.", "She added endearments to her charms : \u2018O my honey-sweet, darling husband, light of your Psyche's life!Her husband unwillingly gave way before the forceful pressure of these impassioned whispers, and promised to do all she asked.\nThen, as dawn drew near, he vanished from his wife's embrace.\nPsyche's sisters enquired about the location of the rock on which she had been abandoned, and they quickly made their way to it.\nThere they cried their eyes out and beat their breasts until the rocks and crags echoed equally loudly with their repeating lamentations.\nThen they sought to conjure up their sister by summoning her by name, until the piercing notes of their wailing voices permeated down the mountainside, and Psyche rushed frantically and fearfully from the house.", "The goat-shaped god was well aware of the calamity that had befallen Psyche.\nHe called her gently to him, lovesick and weary as she was, and soothed her with these consoling words.\n\u2018You are an elegant girl, and I am a rustic herdsman, but my advanced years give me the benefit of considerable experience.\nIf my hazard is correct--sages actually call such guesswork divine insight--I infer from your stumbling and frequently wandering steps, from your excessively pale complexion and continual sighs, and not least from your mournful gaze, that you are suffering grievous love-pains.\nOn that account you must hearken to me: do not seek gain to destroy yourself by throwing yourself headlong or by seeking any other means of death.", "Hearing that unidentified voice consoled her loneliness.\nMeanwhile her parents were aging in unceasing grief and melancholy.\nAs the news spread wider, her elder sisters learnt the whole story.\nIn their sadness and grief they vied with each other in hastily leaving home and making straight for their parents, to see them and discuss the matter with them.\nThat night Psyche's husband (he was invisible to her, but she could touch and hear him) said to her : \u2018Sweetest Psyche, fond wife that you are, Fortuna (Fortune) [Tykhe] grows more savage, and threatens you with mortal danger.\nI charge you: show greater circumspection.\nYour sisters are worried at the rumour that you are dead, and presently they will come to this rock to search for traces of you.", "Only tell our Zephyrus to provide his services again, and allow me at least a glimpse of my sisters as consolation for your unwillingness to let me gaze on your sacred face.\nI beg you by these locks of yours which with their scent of cinnamon dangle all round your head, by your cheeks as soft and smooth as my own, by your breast which diffuses its hidden heat, as I hope to observe your features as reflected at least in this our tiny child: accede to the devoted prayers of this careworn suppliant, and grant me the blessing of my sisters' embraces.\nThen you will give fresh life and joy to your Psyche, your own devoted and dedicated dear one.\nI no longer seek to see your face; the very darkness of the night is not oppressive to me, for you are my light to which I cling.Her husband was bewitched with these words and soft embraces.", "Should you chance to hear their cries of grief, you are not to respond, or even to set eyes on them.\nOtherwise you will cause me the most painful affliction, and bring utter destruction on yourself.Psyche consented and promised to follow her husband's guidance.\nBut when he had vanished in company with the darkness, the poor girl spent the whole day crying and beating her breast.\nShe kept repeating that now all was up with her, for here she was confined and enclosed in that blessed prison, bereft of conversation with human beings for company, unable even to offer consoling relief to her sisters as they grieved for her, and not allowed even to catch a glimpse of

breath-taking abundance of such riches, was the fact that this treasure-house had no protection whatever by way of chain or bar or guard.\nAs she gazed on all this with the greatest rapture, a

take a bath at your leisure.\nThe voices you hear are those of your handmaidens, and we will diligently attend to your needs.\nOnce you have completed your toilet a royal feast will at once be laid

you sourly refuse to allow love-liaisons in your own house, and you close down the manufacture of women's weaknesses which is made available to all?This was how the two goddesses sucked up to Cupidos, seeking to win his favour, though he was absent, by taking his part, for they feared his arrows.\nBut Venus was affronted that the insults which she sustained were treated so lightly.\nShe cut the tow of them short, turned on her heel, and stalked quickly off to the sea.\nEros-Cupid and Psyche, Greco-Roman mosaic from Zeugma C1st-2nd A.D., Gaziantep Museum \"Meanwhile Psyche in her random

met her ears.\nSince the was utterly alone, she trembled and shuddered in her fear for her virginity, and she dreaded the unknown presence more than any other menace.\nBut now her unknown bridegroom

Psyche, \u2018you must enter my hearth and home, and let the company of your Psyche gladden your hearts that were troubled.Following these words, she showed them the magnificent riches of the golden house, and let them hear the voices of her large retinue.\nShe then allowed them the rich pleasure of a luxurious bath and an elegant meal served by her ghostly maids.\nBut when they had had their fill of the copious abundance of riches clearly bestowed by heaven, they began to harbour deep-seated envy in their hearts.\nSo one of them kept asking with nagging curiosity about the owner of those divine possessions, about the identity and status of her husband.\nPsyche in her heart's depths did not in any way disobey or disregard her husband's instructions.", "Cease your sorrowing, lay aside your sadness, and instead direct prayers of adoration to Cupidos [Eros], greatest of gods, and by your caressing attentions win the favour of that wanton and extravagant youth.Psyche made no reply to this advice from the shepherd-god.\nShe merely paid reverential homage to his divine person, and proceeded on her way.\nAfter wandering with weary steps for a considerable distance, as night bell a certain path led her all unknowing to the city where the husband of one of her sisters had his realm.\nPsyche recognised it, and asked that her arrival be announced to her sister.\nShe was then ushered in, and after they had greeted and embraced each other, her sister enquired why she had come.\nPsyche began to explain.", "How appropriate it is that you have fallen into my hands rather than anyone else's.\nYou are now caught fast in the claws of Orcus [Haides], and believe me, you will suffer the penalty for your gross impudence without delay.She then laid a presumptuous hand on Psyche's hair, and dragged the girl in unresisting.\nAs soon as she was ushered in and presented before Venus' gaze, the goddess uttered the sort of explosive cackle typical of people in a furious rage.\nShe wagged her head, scratched her right ear, and said : \u2018Oh, so you have finally condescended to greet your mother-in-law, have you?\nOr is the purpose of this visit rather to see your husband, whose life is in danger from the wound which you inflicted?\nYou can rest assured that I shall welcome you as a good mother-in-law should.'", "Without delay they embarked on their ships and cast off.\nBut Psyche, now left alone, except that being harried by the hostile Furiae (Furies) [Erinyes] was no solitude, tossed in her grief like the waves of the sea.\nThough her plan was formed and her determination fixed, she still faltered in uncertainty of purpose as she set her hands to action, and was torn between the many impulses of her unhappy plight.\nShe made haste, she temperized; her daring turned more to fear, her diffidence to anger, and to cap everything she loathed the beast but loved the husband, though they were one and the same.\nBut now evening brought on darkness, so with headlong haste she prepared the instruments for the heinous crime.\nNight fell, and her husband arrived, and having first skirmished in the warfare of love, he fell in to a heavy sleep.", "She swept the ground with her hair, and begged Ceres' [Demeter's] favour with a litany of prayers.\n\u2018By your fruitful right hand, by the harvest ceremonies which assure plenty, by the silent mysteries of your baskets and the winged courses of your attendant Dracones, by the furrows in your Sicilian soil, by Proserpina's [Persephone's] descent to a lightless marriage, and by your daughter's return to rediscovered light, and by all else which the shrine of Attic Eleusis shrouds in silence--I beg you, lend aid to this soul of Psyche which is deserving of pity, and now entreats you.", "Without a word

aloft, following in his wake and dangling in company with him as they flew through the clouds.\nBut finally she slipped down to earth exhausted.\nAs she lay there on the ground, her divine lover did not leave her, but flew to the nearest cypress-tree, and from its summit spoke in considerable indignation to her.\n\u2018Poor, ingenuous Psyche, I disregarded my mother Venus' instructions when she commanded that you be yoked in passionate desire to the meanest of men, and that you be then subjected to the most degrading of marriages.", "But what a fool I am, mistakenly calling him a son, for the wedding was not between a couple of equal status.\nBesides, ti took place in a country house, without witnesses and without a father's consent, so it cannot be pronounced legal.\nThe child will therefore be born a bastard--if we allow you to reach full term with him at all!Saying this, she flew at Psyche, ripped her dress to shreds, tore her hair, made her brains rattle, and pummelled her severely.\nShe then brought some wheat, barley, millet, poppyseed, chickpeas, lentils and beans.\nShe mingled them together in an indiscriminate heap, and said to her : \u2018You are such an ugly maidservant that I think the only way you win your lovers is by devoted attendance, so I'll see myself how good you are.", "The other areas of the dwelling too, in all its length and breadth, were incalculably costly.\nAll the walls shimmered with their native gleam of solid gold, so that if the sun refused to shine, the house created its own daylight.\nThe rooms, the colonnade, the very doors also shone brilliantly.\nThe other riches likewise reflected the splendour of the mansion.\nYou would be justified in thinking that this was a heavenly palace fashioned for mighty Jupiter [Zeus] when he was engaged in dealings with men.\nPsyche, enticed by the charming appearance of these surroundings, drew nearer, and as her assurance grew she crossed the threshold.\nDelight at the surpassing beauty of the scene encouraged her to examine every detail.\nHer eyes lit upon store-rooms built high on the other side of the house; they were crammed with abundance of treasures.", "Whoever does so will obtain as reward from Venus herself seven sweet kisses, and a particularly honeyed one imparted with the thrust of her caressing tongue.Longing for this great reward aroused eager competition

household called Consueto (Habit) confronted her, and at once cried out at the top of her voice : \u2018Most wicked of all servants, have you at last begun to realize that you have a mistress?\nOr are you, in keeping with the general run of your insolent behaviour, still pretending to be unaware of the exhausting efforts we have endured in searching for you?", "Then he roused Psyche with an innocuous prick of his arrow.\n\u2018Poor, dear Psyche,he exclaimed, \u2018see how as before your curiosity might have been your undoing!\nBut now hurry to complete the task imposed on you by my mother's command; I shall see to the rest.After saying this, her lover rose lightly on his wings, while Psyche hurried to bear Proserpina's [Persephone's] gift back to Venus [Aphrodite].\nMeanwhile

scarcely out of her mouth when she opened the box.", "Then, as soon as the sheep relax their fury and their disposition grows gentle, you must shake the foliage in the neighbouring grove, and you will find golden wool clinging here and there to the curved stems.This was how the reed, endowed with human qualities of openness and kindness, told Psyche in her extremity how to gain safety.\nShe did not disregard this careful instruction and suffer accordingly; she followed out every detail, and the theft was easily accomplished.\nShe gathered the soft substance of yellow gold in her dress, and brought it back to Venus.\nBut the hazard endured in this second trial won her no favourable acknowledgement from her mistress at least, for Venus frowned heavily, smiled harshly, and said : \u2018I know quite well that this too is the work of that adulterer.", "Although the wrong wind was blowing, her eagerness was fired by blind hope, and she said : \u2018Take me, Cupidos, as your worthy wife; Zephyrus, take your mistress aboard!She then took a prodigious leap downward.\nBut not even in death could she reach that abode for her limbs bounced on the rocky crags, and were fragmented.\nHer insides were torn out, and in her fitting death she offered a ready meal to birds and beasts.\nThe second punitive vengeance was not long delayed.\nPsyche resumed her wandering, and reached a second

eagle, the bird of prey who recalled his service of long ago, when following Cupidos' [Eros'] guidance he had borne the Phrygian cupbearer [Ganymedes] to Jupiter [Zeus].\nThe bird now lent timely aid, and directed his veneration for Cupidos's power to aid his wife in her ordeal.\nHe quitted the shining paths of high heaven, flew down before the girl's gaze, and broke into speech : \u2018You are in all respects an ingenuous soul without experience in things such as this, so how can you hope to be able to steal the merest drop from this most sacred and unfriendly stream, or even apply your hand to it?", "But from that stretch of stream one of the green reeds which foster sweet music was divinely inspired by the gentle sound of a caressing breeze, and uttered this prophecy : \u2018Psyche, even though you are harrowed by great trials, do not pollute my waters by a most wretched death.\nYou must not approach the fearsome sheep at this hour of the say, when they tend to be fired by the burning heat of the sun and charge about in ferocious rage; with their sharp horns, their rock-hard heads, and sometimes their poisonous bites, they wreak savage destruction on human folk.\nBut one the hours past noon have quelled the sun's heat, and the flocks have quieted down under the calming influence of the river-breeze, you will be able to conceal yourself under that very tall plane-tree, which sucks in the river-water as I do myself.", "But as soon as Aurora's (the Dawn's) [Eos'] chariot appeared, Venus summoned Psyche, and spoke to her like this : \u2018Do you see the grove there, flanked by the river which flows by it, its banks extending into the distance and its low-lying bushes abutting on the stream?\nThere are sheep in it wandering and grazing unguarded, and their fleeces sprout with the glory of pure gold, I order you to go there ate once, and somehow or other obtain and bring back to me a tuft of wool from the precious fleece.Psyche made her way there without reluctance, but with no intention of carrying out this task.\nShe wanted to seek the cessation of her ills by throwing herself headlong from a cliff above the river.", "Psyche would have perished under the weight of her sufferings, had not Amor, who still loved her in secret, invisibly comforted and assisted her in her labours.\nWith his aid she at last succeeded in overcoming the jealousy and hatred of Venus; she became immortal, and was united with him for ever.\nIt is not difficult to recognise in this lovely story the idea of which it is merely the mythical embodiment, for Psyche is evidently the human soul, which is purified by passions and misfortunes, and is thus prepared for the enjoyment of true and pure happiness.\nIn works of art Psyche is represented as a maiden with the wings of a butterfly, along with Amor in the different situations described in the allegoric story.", "The theatre of heaven at once filled up through fear of this sanction.", "Psyche carefully sorted them out and ordered them in separate piles; no doubt she reflected that she should not neglect the shrines and rites of any deity, but rather implore the kindly spirit of each and all.\nKindly Ceres [Demeter] sighted her as she carefully and diligently ordered these offerings, and at once she cried out from afar : \u2018Why, you poor Psyche!\nVenus [Aphrodite] is in a rage, mounting a feverish search for your traces all over the globe.\nShe has marked you down for the sternest punishment, and is using all the resources of her divinity to demand vengeance.\nAnd here you are, looking to my interests, with your mind intent on anything but your own safety!Then Psyche grovelled at the goddess's feet, and watered them with a stream of tears.", "That bride-to-be dried her tears on her very bridal-veil.\nLamentation for the harsh fate of that anguished household spread throughout the city, and a cessation of business was announced which reflected the public grief.\nBut the warnings of heaven were to be obeyed, and unhappy Psyche's presence was demanded for her appointed punishment.\nSo amidst intense grief the ritual of that marriage with death was solemnized, and the entire populace escorted her living corpse as Psyche tearfully attended not her marriage but her funeral.\nBut when her sad parents, prostrated by their monstrous misfortune, drew back from the performance of their monstrous task, their daughter herself admonished them with these words : \u2018Why do you rack you sad old age with protracted weeping?", "Then you must give the greedy mariner the one coin which you have held back, and once again across the river you must retrace your earlier steps and return to the harmony of heaven's stars.\nOf all these injunctions I urge you particularly to observe this: do not seek to open or to pry into the box that you will carry, nor be in any way inquisitive about the treasure of divine beauty hidden within it.This was how that far-sighted tower performed its prophetic role.\nPsyche immediately sped to Taenarus, and having duly obtained the coins and cakes she hastened down the path to Hades.", "As she retraced her steps, she noticed in a glimmering grove in the valley below an elegantly built shrine.\nNot wishing to disregard any means, however uncertain, which gave promise of brighter hope, and in her eagerness to seek the favour of any divinity whatsoever, she drew close to its sacred portals.\nThere she observed valuable offerings, and ribbons inscribed with gold letters pinned to the branches of trees and to the doorposts.\nThese attested the name of the goddess to whom they were dedicated, together with thanks for favours received.\nShe sank to her knees, and with her hands she grasped the altar still warm from a sacrifice.", "You must whet a razor by running it over your softened palm, and when it is quite sharp hide it secretly by the bed where you usually lie.\nThen fill a well-trimmed lamp with oil, and when it is shining brightly, conceal it beneath the cover of an enclosing jar.\nOnce you have purposefully secreted this equipment, you must wait until your husband ploughs his furrow, and enters and climbs as usual into bed.\nThen, when he has stretched out and sleep has begun to oppress and enfold him, as soon as he starts the steady breathing which denotes deep sleep, you must slip off the couch.\nIn your bare feet and on tiptoe take mincing steps forward, and remove the lamp from its protective cover of darkness.\nThen take your cue from the lamp, and seize the moment to perform your own shining deed.", "Trembling and pale as the blood drained from her face, she barely opened her mouth as she gasped and stammered out this reply to them.\n\u2018Dearest sisters, you have acted rightly in continuing to observe your devoted duty, and as for those who make these assertions to you, I do not think that they are telling lies.\nIt is true that I have never seen my husband's face, and I have no knowledge whatsoever of where he hails form.\nI merely attend at night to the words of a husband to whom I submit with no knowledge of what he is like, for he certainly shuns the light of day.\nYour judgement is just that he is some beast, and I rightly agree with you.\nHe constantly and emphatically warns me against seeing what he looks like, and threatens me with great disaster if I show curiosity about his features.", "Allow me to lurk hidden here among these heaps of grain if only for a few days, until the great goddess's raging fury softens with the passage of time, or at any rate till my strength, which is now exhausted by protracted toil, is assuaged by a period of rest.Ceres [Demeter] answered her : \u2018Your tearful entreaties certainly affect me and I am keen to help you, but I cannot incur Venus's displeasure, for I maintain long-standing ties of friendship with her--and besides being my relative, she is also a fine woman.\nSo you must quit this dwelling at once, and count it a blessing that I have not apprehended and imprisoned you.So Psyche, in suffering this reverse to her hopes, was now beset by a double grief.", "You keep piercing this heart of mine, which regulates the elements and orders the changing motion of the stars, with countless wounds.", "Here we are, her elder sisters, nothing better than maidservants to foreign husbands, banished form home and even from our native land, living like exiles far from our parents, while Psyche, the youngest and last offspring of our mother's weary womb, has obtained all this wealth, and a god for a husband!\nShe has not even a notion of how to enjoy such abundant blessings.\nDid you notice, sister, the quantity and quality of the precious stones lying in the house, the gleaming garments, the sparkling jewels, the gold lying beneath our feet and all over the house?\nIf she has as handsome a husband as she claims, no woman living in the whole world is more blessed.\nPerhaps as their intimacy continues and their love grows stronger, her god-husband will make her divine as well.", "Source: Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology.\nCLASSICAL LITERATURE QUOTES Psyche

hearing the report of this matchless prodigy, gathered in ecstatic crowds.\nThey were dumbstruck with admiration at her peerless beauty.", "\u2018Why,she asked, \u2018do you torture yourselves to no

hug close the sister for whom you grieved.She then summoned Zephyrus, and reminded him of her husband's instruction.\nHe speedily obeyed the command, and at once whisked them down safely on the

poor Psyche and tortured her with other implements, and then restored her to their mistress's presence.\nVenus renewed her laughter.\n\u2018Just look at her,she said.\n\u2018With that appealing swelling in her belly, she makes me feel quite sorry for her.\nI suppose she intends to make me a happy grandmother of that famed offspring; how lucky I am, in the bloom of my young days, at the prospect of being hailed as a grandma, and having the son of a cheap maidservant called Venus's grandson!", "Their hastily summoned tears depressed their parents, reawakening their sorrow to match that of their daughters, and then swollen with lunatic rage they rushed of to their homes, planning their wicked wiles--or rather the assassination of their innocent sister.\nMeanwhile Psyche's unknown husband in their nightly conversation again counselled her with these words : \u2018Are you aware what immense danger overhangs you?\nFortuna is aiming her darts at you from long range and, unless you take the most stringent precautions, she will soon engage with you hand to hand.\nThose traitorous bitches are straining every nerve to lay wicked traps for you.\nAbove al, they are seeking to persuade you to pry into my appearance, and as I have often warned you, a single glimpse of it will be your last.", "But no I shall try you out in earnest, to see if you are indeed endowed with brave spirit and unique circumspection.\nDo you see that lofty mountain-peak, perched above a dizzily high cliff, from where the livid waters of a dark spring come tumbling down, and when enclosed in the basin of he neighbouring valley, water the marshes of the Styx and feed the hoarse streams of the Cocytus?\nI want you to hurry and bring me back in this small jug some icy water drawn from the stream's highest point, where it gushes out from within.Handing Psyche a vessel shaped from crystal, she backed this instruction with still harsher threats.\nPsyche made for the topmost peak with swift and eager step, for she was determined there at least to put an end to her intolerable existence.", "But he kept deterring her with repeated warnings from being ever induced by the baleful prompting of her sisters to discover her husband's appearance.\nShe must not through sacrilegious curiosity tumble headlong from the lofty height of her happy fortune, and forfeit thereafter his embrace.\nShe thanked her husband, and with spirits soaring she said : \u2018But I would rather die a hundred times than forgo the supreme joy of my marriage with you.\nFor I love and cherish you passionately, whoever you are, as much as my own life, and I value you higher than Cupidos [Eros] himself.\nBut one further concession I beg for my prayers: bid your servant Zephyrus (the West Wind) spirit my sisters down to me, as he earlier wafted me down.She pressed seductive kisses on him, whispered honeyed words, and snuggled close to soften him.", "She passed the lame ass-driver without a word, handed the fare to the ferryman for the river crossing, ignored the entreaty of the dead man floating on the surface, disregarded the crafty pleas of the weavers, fed the cake to the dog [Cerberus] to quell his fearsome rage, and gained access to the house of Proserpina [Persephone].\nPsyche declined the soft cushion and the rich food offered by her hostess; she perched on the ground at her feet, and was content with plain bread.\nShe then reported her mission from Venus [Aphrodite].\nThe box was at once filled and closed out of her sight, and Psyche took it.\nShe quietened the

due ceremony Psyche was wed to Cupidos, and at full term a daughter was born to them.", "See that the girl is seized with consuming passion for the lowest possible specimen of humanity, for one who as the victim of Fortuna (Fortune) [Tykhe] has lost status, inheritance and security, a man so disreputable that nowhere in the world can he find an equal in wretchedness.With these words she kissed her

it's done you, or him either!The goddess threw her a crust of bread, and cleared off to bed.\nMeanwhile Cupidos [Eros] was alone, closely guarded and confined in a single room at the back of the house.\nThis was partly to ensure that he did not aggravate his wound by wanton misbehaviour, and partly so that he would not meet his dear one.\nSo the lovers though under the one roof were kept apart from each other, and were made to endure a wretched night.", "She was restless in mind, but all the more eager, in spite of his anger, to soften him with a wife's endearments, or at any rate to appease him with a servant's entreaties.\nShe spied a temple perched on the peak of a high mountain, and she said : \u2018Perhaps this is where my lord dwells?She made her way quickly there, and though her feet were utterly weary from her unremitting labours, her hope and aspiration quickened them.\nShe mounted the higher ridges with stout heart, and drew close to the sacred shrine.\nThere she saw ears of wheat in a heap, and others woven into a garland, and ears of barley as well.\nThere were sickles lying there, and a whole array of harvesting implements, but they were in a jumbled and neglected heap, thrown carelessly by workmen's hands, as happens in summer-time.", "He gets away scot-free with this disgraceful behaviour, and nothing that he does is worthwhile.\nHis own nature

two elder sisters had been betrothed to royal suitors and had contracted splendid marriages, though their more modest beauty had won no widespread acclaim.\nBut Psyche remained at home unattended, lamenting her isolated loneliness.", "So Psyche joyously took the filled jug and hastened to return it to Venus.\nEven so, she was unable to conciliate the harsh goddess's resolve.\nVenus flashed a menacing smile as she addressed her with threats of yet more monstrous ill-treatment : \u2018Now indeed I regard you as a witch with great and lofty powers, for you have carried out so efficiently commands of mine such as these.\nBut you will have to undertake one further task for me, my girl.\nTake this box(she handled it over) \u2018and make straight for Hades, for the funereal dwelling of

was anxious not to betray through a slip of the tongue her silent resolve by continuing the conversation, so she weighed her sisters down with gold artefacts and precious jewels, hastily summoned

the presence of the wafting wind, launched themselves down with impudent rashness into the depths below.\nZephyrus, somewhat unwillingly recalling his king's command, enfolded them in the bosom of his favouring breeze and set them down on solid earth.\nWithout hesitation they at once marched with measured step into the house, and counterfeiting the name of sisters they embraced their prey.", "With joyful expressions they cloaked he deeply hidden deceit which they treasured within them, and flattered their sister with these words : \u2018Psyche, you are no longer the little girl of old; you are

heart.\nAs soon as they had rested their feet to recover from the weariness of the journey, and had steeped their bodies in a steaming bath, Psyche served them in the dining-room with a most handsome and delightful meal of meats and savouries.", "But once the sculling of his wings had removed him from her sight and he had disappeared into the distance, she hurled herself headlong down from the bank of a river close by.\nBut that kindly stream was doubtless keen to pay homage to the god who often scorches even the waters, and in fear for his person he at once cast her ashore on his current

to repeat after him all kinds of songs.\nClose by the bank nanny-goats were sporting as they grazed and cropped the river-foliage here and there.", "Still I must not despise the consolation of gaining revenge from any quarter.\nShe is absolutely the only one to be given the job of imposing the harshest discipline on this rascal.\nShe must empty his quiver, immobilize his arrows, unstring his bow,
