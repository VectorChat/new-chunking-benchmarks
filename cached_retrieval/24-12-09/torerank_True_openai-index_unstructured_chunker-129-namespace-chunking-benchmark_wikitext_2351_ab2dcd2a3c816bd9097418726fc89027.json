["The terms cultigen and cultivar may be confused with each other\nCultigen is a general @-@ purpose term for plants that have been deliberately altered or specially selected by humans while cultivar is a formal classification category\nCultigens include not only plants with cultivar names but also those with names in the classification categories of grex and Group\nThe Cultivated Plant Code points out that cultigens are : deliberately selected plants that may have arisen by intentional or accidental hybridization in cultivation by selection from existing cultivated stocks or from variants within wild populations that are maintained as recognizable entities solely by continued propagation\nIncluded within the group of plants known as cultigens are genetically modified plants plants with binomial Latin names that are the result of ancient human selection and any plants that have been altered by humans but which have not been given formal names\nIn practice most cultigens are cultivars\nThe following account of the historical development of cultivated plant taxonomy traces the way cultigens have arisen and been incorporated into botanical science ; it also demonstrates how two approaches to plant nomenclature and classification have led to the present @-@ day International Code of Nomenclature for algae fungi and plants and International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants", "From the time of the ancient world at least plants have been classified in two ways\nOn the one hand there is the detached academic philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves : this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function\nThen there is the practical utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use\nCultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code\nThis Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce\nThose cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria : they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name ; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations ( except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name ) ; it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation", "As a result of general dissatisfaction and a submission from the Royal Horticultural Society the R\u00e8gles de Nomenclature Horticole was established\nThe use of simple descriptive Latin names ( e.g.\ncompactus nanus prostratus ) for horticultural variants was accepted and so too were names in the local language \u2013 which were not to be translated and should preferably consist of one word and a maximum of three\nThis first Horticultural Code consisted of 16 Articles\nWith the intercession of a World War I it was not until the 9th Horticultural Congress in London in 1930 that the rules of a Horticulture Nomenclature Committee were agreed and added as an appendix to the 1935 Botanical Code\nThe rules established in 1935 were accepted but needed to be extended to include the cultigens of agriculture and forestry but it was only a result of discussions at the 1950 International Botanical Congress in Stockholm and the 18th International Horticultural Congress in London in 1952 the first International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants was published in 1953\nThe American horticultural botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey was responsible for coining the word cultigen in 1918 and cultivar in 1923 the word cultivar only coming into general circulation with the new Code of 1953\nThe use of these two terms belies the multitude of classification terms and categories that had been suggested as designations for cultigens\n= = = 1953 \u2013 the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants = = =", "Much of the work of the cultivated plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes\nThe provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae fungi and plants ( Botanical Code ) serve primarily scientific ends and the objectives of the scientific community while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ( Cultivated Plant Code ) are designed to serve both scientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce \u2014 the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture forestry and horticulture\nThese names sometimes called variety names are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names and they assist communication among the community of foresters farmers and horticulturists\nThe history of cultivated plant taxonomy can be traced from the first plant selections that occurred during the agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans\nThe naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar\nSince that time the classification and naming of cultigens has followed its own path", "= Cultivated plant taxonomy = Cultivated plant taxonomy is the study of the theory and practice of the science that identifies describes classifies and names cultigens \u2014 those plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity\nCultivated plant taxonomists do however work with all kinds of plants in cultivation\nCultivated plant taxonomy is one part of the study of horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens large nurseries universities or government departments\nAreas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include : searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation ( plant hunting ) ; communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics ; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions ( horticultural floras ) ; maintaining databases herbaria and other information about cultivated plants", "The history of cultigen nomenclature has been discussed by William T. Stearn and Brandenberg Hetterscheid and Berg\nIt has also been examined from a botanical perspective and from the origin of the Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 until 2004\nThe early development of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general as the early listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds\nFormal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple binomial system of folk taxonomy and it was not until the mid @-@ 19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy", "This Article making provision for the cultigens of horticultural nomenclature was to remain in the Botanical Code ( with a minor amendment in 1935 suggesting the use of the letter ' c ' before the horticultural name and antedating formal recognition of the cultivar ) through 1906 1912 and 1935 until the separation in 1953 of the Horticultural Code precursor to the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ( Cultivated Plant Code )\nIn 1900 there was the first International Botanical Congress and in 1905 at the second Congress in Vienna an agreed set of nomenclatural rules was established the Vienna Rules which became known from then on as the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature ( now the International Code of Nomenclature for algae fungi and plants )\nAfter World War II the responsibility for the Botanical Code was taken up by the International Association for Plant Taxonomy and meetings to discuss revisions are held at six @-@ yearly intervals the latest being in 2005", "= = Presenting cultigen names = = Most cultigens have names consisting of a Latin name that is governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae fungi and plants e.g.\nMalus domestica to which is added a cultigen epithet enclosed in single quotes e.g.\nMalus domestica ' Granny Smith '\nThe formation and use of the three classification categories ( ranks ) used for cultigens the cultivar Group and grex is regulated by the ICNCP\nExamples of acceptable ways to present cultigen names are given below :", "Current challenges for cultivated plant taxonomists include : the use of large plant name databases ; ways of dealing with the use of non @-@ scientific names in commerce ( known as trade designations ) especially for plant labels in nurseries ; intellectual property and plants ; adapting modern technology in particular molecular techniques to the creation and identification of cultivars ; maintaining germplasm collections of cultivars including herbaria ; the recording and registration of cultivars\nThe ways in which the plant variation resulting from human activity is named and classified remains contentious\nThe replacement of the expression \" cultivated plant \" with the word \" cultigen \" is not universally accepted\nThe debate continues concerning the notions of ranks and taxa as applied to cultigens\nIs it appropriate to call the highly modified transgenic products of human artificial selection \" taxa \" in the same way we do for the products of natural selection in the wild ?\nTo overcome this difficulty the term culton ( pl.\nculta ) has been suggested to replace the word taxon when speaking about cultigens", "= = = 10 @,@ 000 to 400 BCE \u2013 plant domestication = = = William T.

although their exact time and place of true origin will probably remain a mystery\nIn the Western world among the first cultigens would have been selections of the cereals wheat and barley that arose in the early settlements of the Fertile Crescent ( the fertile river valleys of the Nile Tigris and Euphrates ) in the Western Mediterranean\nFood plant selections would also have been made in the ten or so other centres of settlement that occurred around the world at this time\nConfining crops to local areas gave rise to landraces ( selections that are highly adapted to local conditions ) although these are now largely replaced by modern cultivars\nCuttings are an extremely effective way of perpetuating desirable characters especially of woody plants like grapes figs and olives so it is not surprising that these are among the first known plant selections perpetuated in cultivation in the West\nMigrating people would take their plant seeds and cuttings with them ; there is evidence of early Fertile Crescent cereal cultigens being transferred from Western Asia to surrounding lands", "Cultivated plant taxonomy has been distinguished from the taxonomy of other plants in at least five ways\nFirstly there is a distinction made according to where the plants are growing \u2014 that is whether they are wild or cultivated\nThis is alluded to by the Cultivated Plant Code which specifies in its title that it is dealing with cultivated plants\nSecondly a distinction is made according to how the plants originated\nThis is indicated in Principle 2 of the Cultivated Plant Code which defines the scope of the Code as \".. plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to the intentional actions of mankind \" \u2014 plants that have evolved under natural selection with human assistance.Thirdly cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with plant variation that requires the use of special classification categories that do not conform with the hierarchy of ranks implicit in the Botanical Code these categories being the cultivar Group and grex ( which are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code )\nThis feature is also referred to in the Preamble to the Cultivated Plant Code which states that \" The purpose of giving a name to a taxon is not to indicate its characters or history but to supply a means of referring to it and to indicate to which category it is assigned \"\nFourthly cultivated plant taxonomy serves a particular community of people : the Botanical Code focuses on the needs of plant taxonomists as they attempt to maintain order and stability for the scientific names of all plants while the Cultivated Plant Code caters for the needs of", "The key activities of cultivated plant taxonomy relate to classification ( taxonomy ) and naming ( nomenclature )\nThe rules associated with naming plants are separate from the methods principles or purposes of classification except that the units of classification the taxa are placed in a nested hierarchy of ranks \u2013 like species within genera and genera within families\nThere are three classification categories used in the Cultivated Plant Code the cultivar and the Group and the grex but they are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code", "people requiring names for plants used in the commercial world of agriculture forestry and horticulture\nFinally the difference between cultivated plant taxonomy and the taxonomy of other plants has been attributed to the purpose for which the taxonomy has been devised it being plant @-@ centred in the Botanical

) in a list that includes 120 kinds ( cultivars ) of figs grapes apples and olives\nThe names are presented in a way that implies that they would have been familiar to fellow Romans\nThe \" cultivar \" names were mostly of one word and denoted the provenance of the cultivar ( the geographical origin of the place where the plant selections were made )\nWriters up to the 15th century added little to this early work\nIn the Middle Ages the book of hours early herbals illuminated manuscripts and economic records indicate that plants grown by the Romans found their way into monastery gardens\nFor example in 827 CE the following herbs were mentioned in the poem Hortulus by Walafrid Strabo as growing in the monastery garden of St Gallen in Switzerland : sage rue southernwood wormwood horehound fennel German iris lovage chervil Madonna lily opium poppy clary mint betony agrimony catmint radish gallica rose bottle gourd and melon\nIt seems likely that aromatic and culinary herbs were quite widespread and similar lists of plants occur in records of plants grown in Villa gardens at the time of Charlemagne ( 742 \u2013 814 CE )", "The first Cultivated Plant Code ( Wageningen ) which was

results of deliberate repeatable single crosses between two pure lines to produce plants of a particular general appearance that is desirable for horticulture but which are not genetically identical\nThe question remains as to whether the classification categories of cultivar Group and grex are the most appropriate and efficient way to deal with this broad range of plant variation", "As early as the 5th century BCE the Greek philosopher Hippo expressed the opinion that cultigens ( as we call them now ) were produced from wild plants as the result of the care bestowed on them by man a revolutionary view at a time when they were regarded as the special creation and gift of the gods\nIn devising ways of classifying organisms the philosopher Aristotle ( 384 \u2013 322 BCE ) established the important idea of a fundamentum divisionis \u2014 the principle that groups can be progressively subdivided\nThis has been assumed in biological classification ever since and is congruent with the relatively recent idea of evolution as descent with modification\nAll biological classification follows this principle of groups within groups known as a nested hierarchy but this form of classification does not necessarily presuppose evolution\nThe earliest scientific ( rather than utilitarian ) approach to plants is attributed to Aristotle 's student Theophrastus ( 371 \u2013 286 BCE ) known as the \" father of botany \"\nIn his Enquiry into Plants Theophrastus described 480 kinds of plant dividing the plant kingdom into trees shrubs undershrubs and herbs with further

for the amusement of those people he disparagingly called anthophiles ( flower @-@ lovers ) ; these were plants not deserving the attention of serious botanists\nHis views revealed both his prejudice his stance on special creation and his recognition of the difficulties entailed in cultivated plant taxonomy :", "As the community of people dealing with the cultigens of commerce grew so once again the divergence between taxonomy serving scientific purposes and utilitarian taxonomy meeting human needs re @-@ emerged\nIn 1865 German botanist Karl Koch who became General Secretary of the Berlin

American horticulturists and other groups in Europe such as the specialist orchid community made attempts to put order into this chaos within their particular group of interest and devising their own rules for naming the plants of commerce\nFriedrich Alefeld ( 1820 \u2013 1872 ) who used Latin variety names in a monographic study of beans lentils and other legumes distinguished three infraspecific taxonomic categories : Unterart ( subspecies ) Variet\u00e4ten Gruppe and Kultur @-@ Variet\u00e4t all with Latin names\nIn doing this he was probably laying the ground for the later establishment of the cultigen classification categories cultivar and Group\nIn conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a

Institutiones Rei Herbariae he listed about 10 @,@ 000 different plants which he called species organised into 698 genera with illustrations\nThe establishment of this precursor of scientific classification vastly improved the organisation of plant variation into approximately equivalent groups or ranks and many of his genera were later taken up by Carl Linnaeus\nThere was still at this
