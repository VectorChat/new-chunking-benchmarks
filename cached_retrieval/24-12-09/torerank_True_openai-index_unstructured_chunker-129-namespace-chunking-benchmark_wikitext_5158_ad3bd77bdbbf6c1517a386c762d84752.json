["= Northern Isles = The Northern Isles ( Scots : Northren Isles ; Scottish Gaelic : Na h @-@ Eileanan a Tuath ; Old Norse : Nor\u00f0reyjar ) is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the

inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas\nBoth have a developing renewable energy industry\nThey also share a common Pictish and Norse history\nBoth island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 and later the United Kingdom after 1801\nThe islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century\nTourism is important to both archipelagos with their distinctive prehistoric ruins playing a key part in their attraction and there are regular ferry and air connections with mainland Scotland\nThe Scandinavian influence remains strong especially in relation to local folklore and both island chains have strong although distinct local cultures\nThe place names of the islands are dominated by their Norse heritage although some may retain pre @-@ Celtic elements", "The phrase \" Northern Isles \" generally refers to the main islands of the Orkney and Shetland archipelagos\nStroma which lies between mainland Scotland and Orkney is part of Caithness and so falls under Highland council area for local government purposes not Orkney\nIt is however
