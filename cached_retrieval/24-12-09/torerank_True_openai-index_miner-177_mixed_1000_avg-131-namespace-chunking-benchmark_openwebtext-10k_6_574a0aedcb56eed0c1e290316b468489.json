(emphasis added) Here the \"genocidal cull of ethnic-Albanian males\"(7) takes place in the blink of an eye, amidst a torrent of frankly lachrymose descriptions of the convoys of helpless \"worthies.\"\nA second strategy is displacement.", "For another example of this strategy, which is not uncommon, see Moutot, 1999.\nThis article referred to Racak only slightly less misleadingly as an \"attack on a fleeing column of some 40 civilians, old men, women and children.\"\nThe core component, the slaughter of \"battle-age\" males, was invisible in this equation.\nCuriously, a subsequent AFP dispatch (Agence France-Presse, 1999b) noted the death at Racak of \"Ajet Emini.. along with 44 other men.\"", ")(20) The comments, and similar ones, invite two questions.\nFirst, where were the specific expressions of \"fear\" and \"concern,\" the posing of \"one of the scarier questions,\" the references to the \"chilling puzzle,\" two months or one month earlier, when they might have made a difference?\nAnd how did the release of a mere 1,000 men (later increased to 2,000) obviate, or even meaningfully mitigate, the possibility that \"many [men] were dead, locked in camps, or being held by the Serbs as human shields,\" as The Washington Post put it?\nThe releases were used as an excuse to declare a general relief and go home, analytically speaking.", "Mr. Milosevic seems to have planned the destruction of ethnic Albanian Kosovo as a working society.\nThe imprisonment of some Kosovo men, like the killings and forced expulsion of others, was undoubtedly part of this plan.\n...\nThe war is not over until Mr. Milosevic accounts for the Kosovars he has kidnapped and allows them to go home.\n(The Washington Post, 1999b; emphasis added.)\nAgain, where was the editorial on the \"imprisonment of Kosovo men\" and the \"killings and forced expulsion of others\" two months earlier, when it might have helped to arouse concern and influence the policy agenda?", "(Denitch, 1994: 124; emphasis added.)\nThe gendering of the massacre victims and concentration-camp inmates was fairly well established by this point (1994), but Denitch reserves the very \"worst\" designation for the mass rapes of women, rather than the \"vast and well-documented massacres of mostly Muslim civilians,\" overwhelmingly males.\n(14) This dubious hierarchizing of human suffering was implicit throughout much of the discussion of the rape controversy during the Kosovo war.\nFor example, James Rubin on 13 April called for Yugoslavia to \"take immediate steps to punish the perpetrators of rape and other crimes..\" (Rubin quoted in Agence France-Presse, 1999c.)", "Rummel, R.J.

(1999).\n\"Rape as a Weapon of War.\"", "In the context of the Kosovo conflict, this could mean isolating a pattern of rape of women in the conflict, or a pattern of gender-selective executions of men.\nA third-order gendering extends the analysis beyond the boundaries of the immediate conflict, region, and contemporary time-frame.\nIt usually seeks to make broad generalizations about regional, global, and/or historical trends.\nAgain to use our Kosovo examples, this might involve placing the rape of Kosovar women against the broader backdrop of rape as a tool of war in the Balkans in the 1990s.\nIt might go further still, and examine the sexual assault of women as a feature of warfare across civilizations and throughout history.", "While feminist research in this area is to be commended and learned from, it has also contributed to a one-sided depiction of the atrocities of war that tends to consign the male victim to oblivion.\nConsider the evaluation of the Bosnian war by Bogdan Denitch, otherwise one of the most clear-eyed appraisers of Yugoslavia's collapse: It is there [Bosnia] that by far the worst atrocities have taken place.\nNot only have there been vast and well-documented massacres of mostly Muslim civilians by Serbian militias, but concentration camps and massive forcible population transfers, known as \"ethnic cleansing,\" have also been used to change the demographic realities of Bosnia.", "For the most part, the civilian male victims of the slaughter were buried in a slew of other designations- \"Kosovar,\" \"ethnic-Albanian,\" etc.\n-- and their specific vulnerabilities were thereby blurred into the larger backdrop of ethnic conflict.\nNeither The New York Times nor The Washington Post- the two major \"agenda-setting\" newspapers in the United States published a single story or editorial focusing on the phenomenon of gender-selective mass executions.", "Some refugees spoke of a massacre of dozens of men in northern Kosovo about three days ago.\nOthers said the Serbs only allowed one man to remain in each refugee wagon- the driver.\n(York, 1999.)\nFrom a more random sampling of reports on English-language electronic media during this period, one other article eventually turned up from The Los Angeles Times, using two of the same principal sources as the Freeman piece just quoted (U.N. refugee worker Laura Boldrini and the humanitarian worker with the My Lai analogy).", "A complete emptying of Kosovo appears possible as the expulsion of ethnic Albanian refugees resumes with brutal force, the UN refugee agency said Friday.\n\"The effort by the Serbian authorities to expel the entire ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo is again underway,\" Kris Janowski, a spokesman with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told journalists.\n(Agence France-Presse dispatch, 16 April.\n)(13) Britain accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Monday of trying to empty Kosovo of its entire ethnic Albanian population as NATO examine ways to help refugees on the run within the Serbian province.", "She referred to \"an appalling picture and a consistent picture\" of the gender-selective atrocities being committed by the Serbs.", "(Herman and Chomsky, 1988: 37-86.)\nThey presented a comparative treatment of the intensity and character of media coverage of victims who were convenient for U.S. policymakers- Cambodians under the communist Pol Pot; the Polish priest, Jerzy Popieluszko, murdered by Polish security agents- contrasted with inconvenient victims, such as the slaughtered and systematically starved inhabitants of East Timor (invaded by a U.S. ally, Indonesia), or one hundred religious workers killed by U.S.-sponsored terror regimes in Central America.", "A man puts his hands on the window of a bus to give his wife and son a last farewell in Sarajevo.\nMore than 1,000 people who have endured months of siege piled onto Red Cross buses in Sarajevo and headed in an often-delayed convoy toward safety in Croatia.\nBosnian president Alija Izetbegovic signed an order that all women, boys under 18, and men over 60 could leave.\"\nMeaning: who could not?\n15.\nAmong the other apparently less \"ghastly\" acts of gendercide mentioned briefly in the article are the following: \"As many as several hundred thousand ethnic Albanian men may have been detained or harmed by Yugoslav government security forces in the past three weeks.", "More common were phrases like \"mistreatment,\" \"maltreatment,\" \"beatings,\" \"abuse\"- all of which seems inadequate to capture the sadism of the Serb jailers (akin, perhaps, to describing rape as \"unwanted sexual attention\").\nIt was equally striking that what second-order gendering there was of the prison releases- that is, coverage referring to a pattern of gender-selective detentions and disappearances in Kosovo- suggested that a quandary or \"mystery\" somehow had been solved by the release of the men.", "The answers: some were in hiding, some were joining the fight against the Serbs, and others had been detained and led away to destinations unknown.", "The \"summary executions\" and \"men missing\" references are drawn from Perlez, 1999.", "Quite clearly, Kosovo was being \"emptied\" in manner that was highly selective according first to ethnicity- as was generally acknowledged- and secondly to gender, which rarely was.\nRather than being allowed to seek refuge, a substantial portion of the civilian male population was falling prey to a \"genocidal cull,\" and tens of thousands of others were in hiding, at mortal risk of roundup by the Serbs.\nAny who attempted exit with the refugee populations usually ran a gauntlet of Serb paramilitaries and/or regular forces that were prone to strip them selectively and en masse from refugee columns and lead them away to detention or summary execution.", "Pipes filled with lead were also used to beat the men.", "Bird, C.
