["Aristotle, however, chooses the form as more paradigmatically substance.\nThis has puzzled some commentators.\nWiggins (1998: 232ff), for example, thinks that the change in doctrine between Categories and Metaphysics is wholly unhelpful.\nThe choice of form as substance causes perplexity because the form seems to be a universal and equivalent to the secondary substance, and so not the most fundamental case of substance.\nBut whether substantial forms are universals in Aristotle is a controversial matter.\nInterpreters disagree about whether the doghood that is in Fido is best regarded as the universal, or as the particular instance of the universal doghood, other dogs exemplifying numerically different instances of the same universal.", "As we have seen, substances are the paradigm subjects of predication and change, so (iii) and (iv) are met.\nAs Aristotle\u2019s substances are individual things and kinds of things (v) is met.\nA nod is made in the direction of stuffs and kinds of stuff, but Aristotle does not develop this thought, so (vi) is barely met.\nThere were two major problems that the Aristotelian tradition has faced in the modern period.", "Two of the criteria of substancehood presented in the Introduction above are: (v) being individuals and kinds of individual; (vi) being stuffs and kinds of stuff.\nAristotle acknowledges that things under (vi)\u2014\u2018natural bodies such as fire and water and everything of that sort(1028 b10\u201311)\u2014are, or are thought to be, substances.\nBut, without seeming to give much argument, he strongly favours (v) over (vi).\nThe elimination of matter as a good candidate for being substance, leaves either form alone or the composite of form and matter.\nThe composite seems more consonant with the doctrine of Categories, for the composite is the individual.", "Aristotle acknowledges that there are three candidates for being called substance, and that all three are substance in some sense or to some degree.\nFirst, there is matter, second, form and third, the composite of form and matter.\nAristotle acknowledges that matter can be a subject of predication and of change, thereby meeting one of the main criteria set up in Categories (1028 b35ff).\nThis suggests an inadequacy or incompleteness in the account in Categories, for there he had seemed to assume that being the subject of predication belonged peculiarly to substance, and also that a subject is an individual of an appropriate kind\u2014what he calls a \u2018this such\u2019: and matter is not an individual, but that from which an individual is made.", "There are two main sources for Aristotle\u2019s approach to substance, the Categories and Metaphysics Z.\nThese will be discussed in turn.\n2.2.1 Categories", "Substances for Aristotle are individuals, but it is much debated whether they are individualized forms or composites of form and matter.\nThere are at least three serious questions about Aristotle\u2019s substantial forms.\nOne we have already noticed, namely (i) whether such forms are universals or particulars.\nThe others are (ii) what is the relationship between the substantial form and the properties which enter into its definition?\nWe have already noticed this question when discussing Categories.\n(iii) What is the ontological status of such forms?", "Individual substances are more durable than instances of the properties in the other categories, for it is substances that can take on and lose those other properties.\nIndividuals are not, however, very long-lived and on this criterion Aristotle makes what could be regarded as a concession to Plato, for it is form as universal, which Aristotle does not consider properly substance, which is most durable.\nThere are at least two senses in which substantial forms are eternal.\nFirst, Aristotle believes the world to be eternal and all the same species to exist eternally.", "The Categories sets out important logical distinctions between different kinds of attribute, but it does not enter into a metaphysical analysis of substance itself.\nThis takes place mainly in Metaphysics, Book Z.\nIn the latter, the analysis of substances in terms of form and matter is developed, whereas these notions have no place in Categories.\nThe distinction has led some commentators to talk of Aristotle\u2019s \u2018two systems\u2019, containing two radically different conceptions of substance.\n(Graham 1987) In the earlier, Categories, substances are simply individuals; in the later work they are complexes of form and matter.\nWhether this represents a change of view, or whether the purposes of the Categories simply did not require reference to the metaphysical analysis of substance is a moot point.\nIt seems unlikely, however, given Aristotle\u2019s Platonic background, that his early thought was oblivious to the role of form in substance.\nWhichever interpretation of the development of Aristotle\u2019s thought is correct, the introduction of substantial form is what gives the fully developed Aristotelian account of substance.\nAristotle analyses substance in terms of form and matter.\nThe form is what kind of thing the object is, and the matter is what it is made of.\nThe term \u2018matteras used by Aristotle is not the name for a particular kind of stuff, nor for some ultimate constituents of bodies, such as atoms (Aristotle rejects atomism).\n\u2018Matteris rather the name for whatever, for a given kind of object, meets a certain role or function, namely that of being that from which the object is constituted.\nRelative to the human body, matter is flesh and blood.\nThe matter of an axehead is the iron from which it is made.\nRelative to the elements, earth, fire, air and water, matter is an intrinsically characterless \u2018prime matterwhich underlies the qualities of them all.", "Being objects of predication but not being themselves predicable of anything else (at least, not in the way entities in the other categories are: see the problem about attribution to location above).\nBeing able to receive contraries.\n(4 a10) A substance can go from being hot to being cold, or from being red to being blue, but the instance of blue in an object cannot similarly take on and lose a wide range of attributes.\nIf substance did not exist it would be impossible for things in any of the other categories to exist.\nThere could be no instances of properties if there were no substances to possess them.\nBut these criteria do not show why \u2018dogis a secondary substance term and \u2018brown thingis not.\nSo we need marks for being a secondary substance, or substance concept.\nOn this he says two things.\n\u2018It is reasonable that, after the primary substances, their species and genera should be the only other things called (secondary) substance.\nFor only they, of things predicated, reveal the primary substance.(2 b28\u201330) \u2018Of the secondary substances the species is more a substance than the genus, since it is nearer to the primary substance.\nFor if one is to say of the primary substance what it is, it will be more apt to give the species than the genus.(2 b8\u201311)", "Aristotle\u2019s account in Categories can, with some oversimplification, be expressed as follows.\nThe primary substances are individual objects, and they can be contrasted with everything else\u2014secondary substances and all other predicables\u2014because they are not predicable of or attributable to anything else.\nThus, Fido is a primary substance, and dog\u2014the secondary substance\u2014can be predicated of him.\nFat, brown, and taller than Rover are also predicable of him, but in a rather different way from that in which dog is.\nAristotle distinguishes between two kinds of predicables, namely those which are \u2018said ofobjects and those which are \u2018inobjects.\nThe interpretation of these expressions is, as usually with Aristotelian cruxes, very controversial, but a useful way of looking at it is as follows.\nDog is said of Fido because it characterizes him as a whole.\nFat and the others are described as being in because they pick out a constituent feature that could be said to be, in a logical though not a physical sense, part of, or in him.\nFido the individual is not attributable to any further thing at all.\nThis account is intuitive, but perhaps it cannot be treated as a formally adequate definition of the notion of primary substance or individual.\nFido the individual could be said to be in a certain location and so attributed to something, namely a place.\nIt is natural to reply to this that an object is not an attribute of a place in the same way as a property is an attribute of a thing: the property is in a thing \u2018as a subject\u2019, but a place is not a subject to which a thing is attributed: the place does not \u2018underliethe thing as a thing \u2018underliesits properties.\nAlthough this may be true, it presupposes that we already have a grasp on the sense in which properties belong to objects and how this differs from the various ways that objects belong to or can be attributed to things, and that we can call upon this informal understanding in interpreting the theoretical account.\nWhether this is legitimate might depend on what the objective was.\nIf the objective were to explain the difference between substance and property in an entirely non-circular way by appealing to the fact that properties are in substances but substances are not in things, this would involve taking the notion of being in as primitive.\nIf we have to distinguish the sense in which properties are in substances from the way in which substances can be in things\u2014such as places\u2014before we can make the original point, then there has not been a non-circular account.\nIf, on the other hand, the objective is simply to differentiate between concepts already in play, then Categories achieves its objective.\nPerhaps it is better, therefore, to see Aristotle in Categories not as defining \u2018substance\u2019, so that someone wholly lacking the concept might come to understand it, but as exhibiting the marks and characteristics of a primitive concept on which we have an intuitive grasp.\nIf we understand his project in this way, we can see Aristotle as presenting various marks of substance in Categories.\nThe marks of primary substance are:", "The individual substances are the subjects of properties in the various other categories, and they can gain and lose such properties whilst themselves enduring.\nThere is an important distinction pointed out by Aristotle between individual objects and kinds of individual objects.\nThus, for some purposes, discussion of substance is a discussion about individuals, and for other purposes it is a discussion about universal concepts that designate specific kinds of such individuals.\nIn the Categories, this distinction is marked by the terms \u2018primary substanceand \u2018secondary substance\u2019.\nThus Fido the dog is a primary substance\u2014an individual\u2014but dog or doghood is the secondary substance or substantial kind.\nEach arm of this distinction raises different issues.\nIf one is concerned with kinds of substance, one obvious question that will arise is \u2018what makes something a thing of that kind (for example, what is involved in being a dog)?This is the question of the essence of substantial kinds.\nBut if one is concerned with individuals, the parallel question is \u2018what makes something that particular individual of a given kind (for example, what is involved in a dog\u2019s being and remaining Fido)?This is the question of individual essences and of identity over time.\nAristotle was mainly, if not exclusively, concerned with questions of the first kind, but, as we shall see in sections 2.5.2 and 3, the latter question assumed a prominence later.\nThis association of substance with kinds carries over into a use of the term which is perhaps more scientific, especially chemical, than philosophical.\nThis is the conception according to which substances are kinds of stuff.\nThey are not individual objects nor kinds of individual object.\nExamples of this usage are water, hydrogen, copper, granite or ectoplasm.\nThere is a connotation of the word \u2018substance\u2019, reflected in the sense of substantial, which signifies durability or even permanence.\nEvents, or Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are never substantial in this sense, because they are fleeting.\nAtoms, fundamental kinds of stuff, gods, or abstract entities, such as Platonic Forms or numbers, might be considered to be substantial to the point of being indestructible or eternal: they last at least as long as the world exists\u2014and, in the case of gods or God, or abstract entities, perhaps longer.\nIt seems, in summary, that there are at least six overlapping ideas that contribute to the philosophical concept of substance.\nSubstances are typified as: being ontologically basic\u2014substances are the things from which everything else is made or by which it is metaphysically sustained; being, at least compared to other things, relatively independent and durable, and, perhaps, absolutely so; being the paradigm subjects of predication and bearers of properties; being, at least for the more ordinary kinds of substance, the subjects of change; being typified by those things we normally classify as objects, or kinds of objects; being typified by kinds of stuff.\nWe shall see later that the Kantian tradition adds a seventh mark of substance: substances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our spatio-temporal framework, and the individuation and re-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework.\n(It should be remarked in passing that at least one major expositor of Aristotle (Irwin: 1988, especially chs 1, 9, 10) attributes a very similar intention to Aristotle himself.)\nIn section 3.5 we shall introduce a notion grounded in Aristotle\u2019s account, but which has not naturally found a place in the earlier discussion, namely the connection between substance and teleology.\nThis can be expressed as: The substances in a given system are those entities crucial from the teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucialmeans that other things exist either to constitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.\nDifferent philosophers emphasize different criteria from amongst this list, for reasons connected with their system as a whole.\nOne could plausibly say that an account is intuitively more appealing, the more of the criteria it can find a place for.\nProbably, the Aristotelian tradition comes nearest to doing this.", "It might be argued that this intuition begs the question against the bundle theory.\nAt the current state of the debate, it looks as if there is no compelling reason for accepting substratum.\nThe Aristotelian tradition anchors the concept of substance, at least in nature, primarily to instances of species of natural object.\nThe Kantian tradition ties it to those enduring bodies the individuation of which gives sense and structure to our spatio-temporal framework.", "First, there is organization of the minute parts of particular kinds of objects, which is responsible for the manifest properties of those objects, and which he thinks will always fall beyond our knowledge.\nSecond is the mystery of what holds the minute parts together: the problem of explaining attraction in a system that only understands influence by impact.\n(xxiii 23).\nThird, is that idea of substance as a bare substratum, which is \u201ca supposed, I know not what, to support those ideas we call accidents.\u201d (xxiii 15).", "On this view, the most perspicuous way of regarding the individual substance is not as the composite of form and matter (though this is not wrong) but as the form individualized in the matter.\nThe matter is still an essential component in the substance, but not, so to speak, as an equal partner with the form, but as the catalyst by means of which the form becomes an individual substance.\nIt is clear, however, that if one holds that Aristotle thinks that forms are universals, then forms are not substance, for, in his attacks on Plato, Aristotle makes it plain that universals are not substance.", "David Wiggins (1967, 1980, 2001) has made a sustained attempt to prove that these two objectives necessarily go together and to make the Aristotelian notion of substance, even including its bias towards the biological, central to our practice of individuating objects.\nWiggins assumes that individuating a temporally enduring object involves being able to re-identify it at different times and under different descriptions.\nThis assumption makes it possible to state substance individuation using the language of identity.", "Aristotle is undoubtedly a realist about substantial forms, in the sense of thinking them to be something more than a mere collection of properties, but how are we to understand this \u2018more\u2019?\nIt would be universally agreed by scholars that substantial forms are real in the sense that they play an irreducible and ineliminable explanatory role in the behaviour of the things in which they are the form.\nThere are two interpretations of what Aristotle meant by this, one of which seems compatible with modern science and the other not.", "Philosophers and scientists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries believed that in rejecting such influences they were rejecting the Aristotelian doctrine of substance.\nFinally, let us consider how Aristotle fares according to the criteria of substance with which we ended the introduction.\nAristotelian substance, whether construed as individualized form or composite of form and matter meets (i), the criterion of ontological basicness.\nIt also meets (ii), relative durability, although in a rather modest manner.", "x is a substance if and only if x is a particular and there is no particular y such that y is not identical to x and the identity of x depends on the identity of y.\nHe considers two objections to his own account which would seem to apply to all independence accounts.\nOne is that it cannot cope with essential properties, for it seems to imply that, for any given property-instance, a substance can exist without it, which is not true of essential properties.\nThe other is that it cannot cope with the necessity of origin for individual identity.", "It would seem that these properties belong to objects in different ways when they are part of a definition from when they are not.\nThe issue is what constitutes the unity of the species or secondary substance: why is it not just a collection of properties and, if it is just such a collection, why is it so different from any other collection of properties?\nIn order to begin to see how Aristotle tackled this problem we need the apparatus of form and matter, which does not appear in the Categories.\n(We will see when discussing contemporary theories in section 3.1, however, that it is not clear that even now can we provide a wholly non-circular account of substance.)\n2.2.2 Metaphysics", "The analogy with thought hardly emphasizes the independence of substance!\nNevertheless, created substances do constitute the created world, and do, in that sense, meet criterion (i) for being substance.\nThey are also the subjects of predication, so they meet criterion (iii).", "In other words the informed parts of an object \u2013 in the case of a living creature, its organs, and the various kinds of stuff that constituted it (in the end, quantities of earth fire air and water) did not possess their own forms, but were informed by the overall substantial form.\nOthers disagreed.\nSome of the disagreements were internal to the hylomorphic system.\nDuns Scotus, for example, argued that a dead person\u2019s body was the same body as had existed when that person was alive.", "There are interpreters of Aristotle who think that this kind of irreducibility is all that Aristotle means\u2014or needs to mean\u2014by postulating an explanatory role for substantial form.\nHis theory is at least neutral on the question of whether there is a closed system at the level of basic physics.\nThe stronger, incompatibilist interpretation is that Aristotle did not believe that the behaviour of complex entities followed from the laws that govern their parts or their matter.", "Whichever of these is the correct interpretation of Aristotle, it was the second which was the core of \u2018Aristotelian scienceas found in scholastic philosophy, and it was this aspect of the Aristotelian doctrine of substance that aroused most opposition amongst seventeenth century philosophers and scientists.\nThey insisted that bodies behave as they do because of the mechanical consequences of the nature of the matter from which they are made: the matter is not \u2018pushed aroundor organized by a substantial form.", "That being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in one coherent body, partaking of one common life, it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life, though that life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant\u2026.\n(Essay II.27.4) One might wonder what this \u2018common lifeis supposed to be, especially in the light of his rejection of Aristotelian \u2018substantial forms\u2019.\nFurthermore, it is tempting to argue that all coherent, solid bodies\u2014such as a lump of rock or plasticene\u2014have some principle of organization which persists through change.", "But we have also seen that the boundaries between these kinds are largely a matter of convention, which is not true of Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.\nIn so far as their individuation is dependent on human convention, they are not ultimately real in their own right.\nBut though they are not real as kinds, the individual parcels of matter that we classify in these ways are perfectly real.\nLocke does not, as far as I can see, refer to these individuals as \u2018substances\u2019.\nSubstances, considered as kinds, or instances of kinds, can sustain change\u2014living things, for example, change in size throughout their lives.", "It is clear that this way of thinking paves the way for atomism and its associated problems as they emerged in early modern philosophy.\nThe concept of substance figures centrally in a positive way for the rationalist philosophers, in a way that it does not for the empiricists.\nThe rationalistssubstances are not, however, the individual objects of everyday life.", "This line of thought proved to be a slippery slope, and, as so often, the downward slide was led by William of Ockham.\nOn the one hand, Ockham was committed to hylomorphism, in that a substance is composed of form and matter.\nBut he reverses the priorities of Aquinas and Scotus by saying that the parts are actual in their own right and do not derive their actuality from the whole: rather, the whole is nothing but the sum of its parts.", "Many of the concepts analysed by philosophers have their origin in ordinary\u2014or at least extra-philosophical\u2014language.\nPerception, knowledge, causation, and mind would be examples of this.\nBut the concept of substance is essentially a philosophical term of art.\nIts uses in ordinary language tend to derive, often in a rather distorted way, from the philosophical senses.\n(Such expressions as \u2018a person of substanceor \u2018a substantial reasonwould be cases of this.\n\u2018Illegal substancesis nearer to one of the philosophical uses, but not the main one.)\nThere is an ordinary concept in play when philosophers discuss \u2018substance\u2019, and this, as we shall see, is the concept of object, or thing when this is contrasted with properties or events.\nBut such \u2018individual substancesare never termed \u2018substancesoutside philosophy.\nReflection on the concept of an object has its first theoretical articulation in Aristotle\u2019s Categories, where he distinguishes between individual objects and the various kinds of properties they can possess.\nHe illustrates the various categories: each [individual term] signifies either substance or quantity or qualification or a relative or where or when or being in a position or having or doing or being affected.\nTo give a rough idea, ideas of substance are man, horse; of quantity: four foot, five foot; of qualification; white, grammatical; of a relative: double, half, larger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when: yesterday, last year; of being in a position: is-lying, is-sitting; of having: has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of being-affected: being-cut, being-burnt.\n(1b25\u20132a4)", "Our discussion of Aristotle ended by returning to the issue if the unity of substantial form \u2013 what is the difference between a collection of \u2018essentialproperties and the form as a unitary entity.\nVarious aspects of this issue of the unity of substantial form preoccupied medieval philosophers.\nAccording to Aquinas, a substance possessed only one form, and its matter was the essentially characterless prime matter.", "Lowe responds to the former objection by saying that essential properties are identical with the substance, so cannot be cited as something other than substance that meets his criterion for being substance.\nIt is not clear that this will work.\nThe idea that the essence is identical with the substance is Aristotelian, but it is not clear how this applies to essential properties, taken individually.\nWe have already seen, in our discussion of Aristotle, that the relation between the essence as some kind of unity and the properties that seem to constitute it is not clear.", "One subject that has not been discussed is the connection between the doctrine of substance and teleology.\nAristotle regards this relation as important, but in this entry it will have a section of its own, 3.5 below.", "Almost all major philosophers have discussed the concept of substance and an attempt to cover all of this history would be unwieldy.\nThe selection made will concentrate on those philosophers in whom the broadly analytic tradition has shown most interest.\nFirst we shall look at the development of the concept in the ancient world, culminating in the work of Aristotle.\nHis account dominated debate through the Middle Ages and until the early modern period.\nWe shall consider various rationalist and empiricist treatments of the concept.\nLocke\u2019s contribution will be considered in especial detail because so much contemporary discussion is inspired (as we shall see in section 3) by an Aristotle-Locke nexus.\nMany of the pre-socratic philosophers in fact had a concept of substance rather like that above attributed to chemistry: that is, their emphasis was on criterion (vi) above.\nThey thought, that is, that the being of the universe (hence they were pursuing substance in sense (i)) consisted in some kind or kinds of stuff.\nThales, for example, thought that everything was essentially water, and Anaximenes that everything was a form of air.\nFor Anaximander, the \u2018stuffin question was indeterminate, so that it could transmute into the various determinate stuffs such as water, air earth and fire.\nBy contrast, atomists such as Democritus took those determinate particular objects they called \u2018atomsto be the substance of the universe.\nAtoms are objects in our ordinary sense, though they are not our ordinary objects: they are not dogs and cats or tables and chairs.\nThey are the subjects of predication, but they do not change their intrinsic properties.\nClassical atoms are, therefore, strong instances of (i) and (ii), but somewhat deviant cases of (iii) and (v).", "(ii) Durability.\nAgain, it meets the criterion, but in an empty way.\nIt is difficult to see how it could be destroyed (like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter) but it has no positive nature.\n(iii) and (iv) Bearer of predication and subject of change.\nAs with matter for Aristotle, it meets the first of these standards well, but, in so far as it is a component only in atoms, it is not the subject of change.\n(v) and (vi) Kinds of individuals and stuffs.\nAlthough in everything, it is itself no kind of thing and therefore no kind of individual or stuff.", "This distinction, however, is one that has to be handled carefully, especially within a realist Kantian framework, such as Strawson provides.\nThis should become clear below when we discuss Wiggins\u2019s theory, which is both Aristotelian and Strawsonian.\nNevertheless, it gives ground for adding the seventh of the marks of substance mentioned in the Introduction, namely that substances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our spatio-temporal framework and individuation and re-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework.", "The first role will not be necessary if one thinks that there is a \u2018master propertyof which the others are modes, or if one thinks that unity can come from some causal or organizational connection.\n(ii) will not apply to a tropist theory, or if one thinks that location will do the job.\n(iii) rests on the intuition that no collection of properties could, in themselves, amount to a substance: the very idea is a category mistake, and only the presence of a special \u2018substantializingelement could do that.", "They also both relate to issues in contemporary philosophy of substance, in which Locke\u2019s influence is almost as important as Aristotle\u2019s.\n2.5.1 Locke on \u2018pure substance in general\u2019", "Because there is a continuum of perspectives on reality, there is an infinite number of these substances.\nNevertheless, there is internal change in the monads, because the respect in which its content is vivid varies with time and with action.\nIndeed, the passage of time just is the change in which of the monad\u2019s contents are most vivid.", "Second there is the relation between substances and our practices of individuation and reidentification.\nIn particular, we shall look at the issue of whether objects must be individuated under the kind of sortal expressions that correspond to Aristotelian substance concepts, or whether a more generic notion, such as physical body, will suffice.\nThis latter concern will lead on to a consideration of the connection between substance and teleology.\nOne natural response to the question of what distinguishes substances from properties is that properties depend for their existence on substances, for they are properties of objects (that is, of individual substances), but that substances do not similarly depend on properties for their existence.", "The situation is different for Leibniz\u2019s monads\u2014which is the name he gives to individual substances, created or uncreated (so God is a monad).\nWhereas, for Aristotle, the properties that an object has to possess and those that it possesses throughout its existence coincide, they do not do so for Leibniz.", "They are: (1) explaining and justifying the sense in which substantial forms have causal or explanatory power, especially in the light of a developed mechanistic chemistry or physics; (2) the difficulty in understanding the relation of substantial form to properties, especially those in terms of which a given substance is defined.\nThese are connected.\nIt is because the substantial form has genuine causal force that it is conceived of by Aristotle as a unified entity in its own right, and not just as a name for the collocation of properties in terms of which it is defined.", "The matter is not so simple, however.\nIt is possible, and not uncommon, for concepts of a certain kind to be exemplified, but for it to be the case that, nevertheless, entities answering directly to those concepts are not included in the most economical statement of one\u2019s ontology.\nThis is reductionism, and it can operate in either of two ways, namely either analytical reductionism or what one might call de facto or \u2018nothing butreductionism.\nIn the present case, it would conform to the analytical option if the concept of substance could be analysed in terms of properties or events (e.g., \u2018to be a substance =df to be a collection of properties bound together in way W\u2019).", "The second of these two points is more uncontroversial than the first, for it is indubitable that species terms focus more precisely on particular things than generic terms.\nThe first is, however, once again intuitive but not compelling.\nIt appeals to the fundamental intuition that \u2018dogtells you what Fido is better than \u2018brown thingdoes, but does not really give a reason for this claim.\nOnly in Section 3.3, when we discuss Wiggins\u2019s theory, will we find more formal reasons for treating species or sortal concepts as more revealing of \u2018what something really isthan are other terms.\nThe division between being said of and being in\u2014that is, between substance concepts and other properties\u2014seems intuitively clear enough until one remembers that substance concepts are complex and are definable in terms of other properties.\nThus, \u2018manis defined as \u2018featherless bipedor \u2018rational animal\u2019, and it would seem that \u2018featherless\u2019, \u2018two-footedor \u2018rationalare properties and hence the kinds of things that are in objects.\nAristotle denies that this is so when they enter into the definition of a substance.\nThe features that specifically make an object the kind of substance that it is, are called differentiae, and Aristotle says the differentia also is not in a subject.\nFor footed and two-footed are said of man as subject, but are not in a subject; neither footed not two-footed is in man.\n(3 a23\u20135)", "3.2.2.\nThe concept of substratum or \u2018thin particularIf one is not satisfied with a bundle theory of substance, so that one thinks that an individual substance is more than a collection of properties, how is one to understand this \u2018more\u2019?\nThis question can be given a deflationary or a substantive answer.\nThe deflationary answer is that a substance is a thing which has properties, and that is all one needs to say.\n(See, for example, Crane and Farkas 2004, 143f, and Chisholm 1969.)", "But one might still hold that, though the concept of substance is not precisely analysable and is indispensible, substances in fact are nothing but collections of properties.\nThis latter is the de facto option.\nSo the existence of substances does not show that the concept is important from a philosophical perspective, or, if it has some significance, whether this is just as a necessary part of our conceptual scheme, or as an ineliminable feature of reality itself.\n3.2.1 Bundle theories and their problems We have just noted that there could be analytically reductionist or de facto reductionist accounts of substance in terms of properties.", "Leibniz\u2019s substances, however, are the bearers of change (criterion (iv)) in a very different way from Aristotle\u2019s individual substances.\nAn Aristotelian individual possesses some properties essentially and some accidentally.\nThe accidental properties of an object are ones that can be gained and lost over time, and which it might never have possessed at all: its essential properties are the only ones it had to possess and which it possesses throughout its existence.", "This is connected with the second question, for it is connected with the question of what the substantial form is over and above the properties essential to it.\nWhat I mean by this is as follows.\nLet us agree, for purposes of argument, that human being is a kind of substance and that rationality and animality are the properties in terms of which that substance is defined.\nIt is uncontroversial that these properties are meant to be objective features of the external world.\nBut what is the relation between the substantial form and those properties?", "Is the presence of the substantial form human being nothing more than the presence of those properties, or is the form something further which is, in some sense responsible for the presence of those properties?\nWe saw in the previous section that the differentia in terms of which a substance is defined is not treated as being \u2018inobjects, as other properties are.\nThis seems to suggest that calling an object a substance of a certain sort is not just a way of attributing to it the properties in terms of which it is defined.", "It is a necessary condition for F\u2019s being an ultimate sortal that, whenever it applies to something, it applies in a present-tensed manner to the thing through the whole of its existence.\nThe statue and the lump of clay are dealt with by denying that the lump and the statue are identical: the lump of clay constitutes the statue, but is not identical with it.", "It is also the case that the properties might be conceived of as universals, or as individuals\u2014that is, property-instances, which are sometimes called \u2018tropes\u2019.\nThere are, therefore, four options for the bundle theorist.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of some relation between properties conceived as universals.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of properties conceived of as individuals, e.g., as property-instances or tropes.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as universals.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as individuals.", "If it were possible for a given sortal, such as sword, sometimes to be an ultimate sortal and sometimes a phase sortal, it is not clear how such an expression would differ from an expression such as brown thing, which may or may not characterize something through the whole of its existence.", "Causation then becomes constant conjunction, or substance a name for a bundle of properties organized in a certain way or the continuing of the possibility of certain sensations.\nKant developed the other variant.\nHe took Hume\u2019s \u2018tendencies of the mind to passfrom one idea to another, without which we could not construct the world, and canonized them as a priori categories of the understanding.\nHume\u2019s empiricist emphasis is psychological.\nIt concerns what we are habituated to do.\nBecause of his empiricism, he will not bring non-psychological necessity into it.\nNevertheless, there is the implication that making these transitions is the only way in which one can understand the world.", "Nothing but the universe as a whole meets this criterion fully.\nLeibniz was not satisfied by this conception of divine substance, at least in part because it confines God to what actually exists.\nFor Leibniz, God contains within himself all possibilities, not just the actual world: this latter is just that maximal set of possibilities that he has best reason to actualize.", "Substratum\u2019s claim to substancehood does not rest, however, on meeting the tests itself, but on being what enables particular kinds of substances to be substances.\nAccording to the believer in substratum, it is in virtue of their inhering in a substratum that a collection of properties can constitute an enduring, change-sustaining thing of a certain kind.\nWithout that support, individual instances of properties could, if they could exist at all, be no more than ephemeral events.\nWe have seen that Locke\u2019s particular substances are kinds of things, and because they are kinds they correspond to Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.", "The ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2014called sortals\u2014are formed by collecting such combinations of simple ideas, as are by experience and observation of men\u2019s senses, taken notice of to exist together, and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance.\nThus we come to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water, etc\u2026 (II xxiii 3)", "All natural ultimate sortals designate unified physical bodies in the manner prescribed in (1), and so are very suitable as substitutions for F. It is logically possible, however, that this might not have been so (there might logically have been natural sortals that worked like swordstick), but that they do follow this model, and are not like swordstick, is a pretty deep fact about our world and about any world with similar laws of nature to those that hold in our world.", "Furthermore, the relevant concept must be an Aristotelian substance concept or sortal.\nMore formally, this can be expressed as follows: If a = b then (a) there is a sortal F such that: a is an F b is an F a is the same F as b.\nThe second claim is that is that if the object picked out by \u2018aalso falls under another sortal, G, then so will the object picked out by \u2018b\u2019, and it will be the same G as a.", "And substances are distinguished from events in the following way: events are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are temporally composed of further things of the same category (i.e., events): substances are those property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are not temporally composed of things of the same category (i.e., of substances) but endure singly through the period.\nLowe, in his (1998), which contains a very thorough discussion of all the topics discussed in this section, defends an \u2018independenceaccount of substance, which he states in terms of identity, as follows:", "It is useful at this point to take note of the three different functions the thin particular or substratum might fulfil.\nIts role might be (i) to bind the properties into a unity, so that they do not \u2018fall apart\u2019: (ii) to individualize them, if they are universals: (iii) to carry one across the categorial barrier from property to substance; that is, to be what it is that makes something to be in the category of substance.", "This brings out a major difference between substances and events, namely that the temporal parts of events are themselves events in their own right, but the temporal parts of objects\u2014meaning by that expression the temporal phases of an object\u2019s existence\u2014are not themselves objects.\nIndeed, it is not natural to talk of the temporal parts of objects, though some philosophers (led by David Lewis (1986), but see also Sider (2001), Hawley (2001) and the entry on temporal parts) think that there are compelling philosophical reasons for doing so.", "When I say \u2018This is an orangeI mean that there are here instances of certain properties such as orangeness, sphericality etc., and I indicate that I am operating on my ideas of those instances in a certain combining manner.\n(1987: 202.\nItalics added.)\nThis solution, as Bennett recognizes, makes substancehood a function of how we operate on the properties we perceive.\nIt is, in that sense, more Kantian than realist.\nAs what it recognizes as out there in the world is just a bundle of properties, it does not dissolve the problem in the way that a deflationist would require.", "This argument seems to conflate the notions of substratum as pure logical support with that as minute parts.\nIf he means minute parts, then, though it is true that we do not and, in his view, cannot know in detail what they are, we have a theory, which he endorses, that they are probably minute parts as conceived by the atomists, which means they have primary qualities similar in kind though not in scale to those possessed by macroscopic objects.\nThis gives a coherent, though speculative, conception of material substance.\nOf spiritual substance, we have no similar hypothesis.\nIf, on the other hand, he means pure logical substratum, there is nothing to know, for there is no more to it, in either the material or spiritual case, than its role as substratum.\nHe seems to conflate the ignorance we have of minute parts with the logical emptiness of the idea of pure substratum.\nIn fact there are three issues concerning the material underpinning of things which Locke regards as mysterious, and he seems to move indifferently from one to the other.", "Allowing sortals of this kind would put the concept of sortal under pressure, for an ultimate sortal was originally thought to be a kind of concept that necessarily characterizes an object present-tensedly throughout its existence, not a concept that sometimes does and sometimes does not.", "Furthermore, there is a sense in which all monads are exactly similar to each other, for they all reflect the whole world.\nThey each do so, however, from a different perspective.\nFor God, so to speak, turns on all sides and considers in all ways the general system of phenomena which he has found it good to produce\u2026And he considers all the faces of the world in all possible ways\u2026the result of each view of the universe, as looked at from a certain position, is\u2026a substance which expresses the universe in conformity with that view.", "As he does not have substances as individuals made of kinds of stuff, there is no conflict between individuals and stuffs.\nFor Spinoza, there is only one substance, the existence of which is demonstrated by a version of the ontological argument, which is thought of as being both God and Nature.", "Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994 and 1997) develop a different, though probably not incompatible, conception of the relative independence of substances compared to other categories.\nSubstance, they say, is the only category of thing which might have only one instance through at least a minimally extended period of time.\nThus, for example, there is no possible world which has, in a given period of time, only one event, for any non-instantaneous event will be made of events which are its parts.\nSimilarly for properties or tropes, there can never be only one because any one entails the existence of others, as, for example, the existence of a red property (instance) entails the existence of (an instance of) the property colour.\nBy contrast, there could exist through a period of time just one substance, provided that it was atomic.", "It seems plausible that this particular case of something\u2019s being allegro could not have been exemplified by another performance, but the performance might go on to be andante in another movement, so the event can continue to exist without that original property.\nThe assimilation of events with substances in this way seems strained, however.\nIt does not seem natural to say that the same event was first allegro, then andante, because it is more natural to attribute the different properties to different parts of the event, which are themselves events (in this case, movements).", "The disposition of properties in nature need not have been as it is and might actually contain oddities not corresponding to any of our sortals.\nSortals, unlike Aristotelian species, place no constraints on how individual objects must or ought to be.\nLocke\u2019s contribution is, therefore, three-fold.\nHe brings to centre stage the question of whether properties require some substratum or bare particular to inhere in or belong to.\nHe asserts that the substantial nature of the physical world is the unknown structure of atomic parts, not a substantial form which reflects our usual concepts.\nThird, he develops a theory of substance which is realist about particular objects and their properties, but conceptualist or conventionalist about our classifications, within the constraints that the facts about particulars and properties impose.", "He thought that we add the optimistic assumption that there will be similarity at the microscopic level.\nWhat many philosophers, under Putnam\u2019s influence, now think he should have said is that gold is that kind of thing which is individuated by a particular kind of minute structure that underlies the stuff which is gold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia.\nIn other words, our confidence that these kinds have a genuine real essence is built into the concept.\nIf this is correct, then our ordinary \u2018natural kindconcepts, like water and gold, have built into them intimations of a deeper unity than that supplied by superficial features, even if it be allied to a complete agnosticism about what that unity might consist in or whether we might ever uncover it.", "Though it is natural to say that the statue is constituted by the atoms, it is less natural to say that the atoms and the structure taken together, are what it is made from: rather it might seem natural to say that that is what it is.\nTo use the Aristotelian terminology, there is strong pressure to say that atoms and structure together are matter and form, and hence are the complete individual.\nAll these issues are very controversial, and different philosophers have different intuitions.\n(See, for example, Rea 1997.)", "But it is only a contingent truth that the terms that can substitute for F in his formal proof are generally\u2014but not always\u2014sortals of an Aristotelian kind.\nAnything can be substituted for F which picks the object out as a unified body.\nTake Wiggins\u2019s formula, a = F b, where it is assumed that the F is a material object (not God or a spirit etc).\nThe following theses might plausibly be maintained.\nFor any identifiable and re-identifiable object, there must be some predicate F which applies to it in a present-tense manner through the whole of its existence, and which, by its meaning, picks the object out as a unified physical whole.", "Two major areas of controversy require attention.\nFirst, there are the issues concerning how to characterize substance in contradistinction to properties and the other categories.\nThere are at least two major questions here.\nOne concerns defining the notion of substance.\nIn particular, there has been much debate about whether substance can be accounted for in terms of its special kind of independence.\nThe other is whether substancehood require some extra component beyond properties, (and, if so, what?)\nor whether a \u2018bundle of propertiestheory of substance is adequate.", "In fact it implies that every individuable object falls under just one ultimate sortal.\n(Wiggins admits this in (2001: 67 n.7).\nWhat is meant by ultimate sortal will emerge below.)\nFor every ultimate sortal has its own principle of individuation, and if an object fell under more than one, there could be a time at which it satisfied the criteria for one and not for the other.", "In the Newtonian model, solidity might fill this role, for shape is merely the outline of the solidity which constitutes the heart of the object.\nIn a sense, theories of this kind are not ordinary bundle theories, for one property is chosen to fill the role of substratum, because the other properties inhere in, or are modes of, it.\nWhether anything could perform this role from amongst the properties that are basic to modern, post-Newtonian physics\u2014properties such as charm, energy, spin and mass\u2014is not easy to judge.", "By contrast, the behaviour of the matter is influenced by what it is the matter of.\nThe nature of the matter places restrictions on what the enmattered thing can do\u2014an animal can only be made from living tissue, not of stone or fire\u2014but exactly how that matter behaves depends on the substantial form present in it.\nThe substantial form plays, therefore, an essential role, not merely in certain kinds of scientific explanation, but by being a fundamental efficient cause in its own right.", "First published Sun Oct 3, 2004; substantive revision Fri Nov 16, 2018.\nThe second use of the concept is more specific.\nAccording to this, substances are a particular kind of basic entity, and some philosophical theories acknowledge them and others do not.\nOn this use, Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are not substances, even though they are the building blocks of\u2014what constitutes \u2018beingfor\u2014his world.\nAccording to this usage, it is a live issue whether the fundamental entities are substances or something else, such as events, or properties located at space-times.\nThis conception of substance derives from the intuitive notion of individual thing or object, which contrast mainly with properties and events.\nThe issue is how we are to understand the notion of an object, and whether, in the light of the correct understanding, it remains a basic notion, or one that must be characterized in more fundamental terms.\nWhether, for example, an object can be thought of as nothing more than a bundle of properties, or a series of events.\nThere could be said to be two rather different ways of characterizing the philosophical concept of substance.\nThe first is the more generic.\nThe philosophical term \u2018substancecorresponds to the Greek ousia, which means \u2018being\u2019, transmitted via the Latin substantia, which means \u2018something that stands under or grounds things\u2019.\nAccording to the generic sense, therefore, the substances in a given philosophical system are those things which, according to that system, are the foundational or fundamental entities of reality.\nThus, for an atomist, atoms are the substances, for they are the basic things from which everything is constructed.\nIn David Hume\u2019s system, impressions and ideas are the substances, for the same reason.\nIn a slightly different way, Forms are Plato\u2019s substances, for everything derives its existence from Forms.\nIn this sense of \u2018substanceany realist philosophical system acknowledges the existence of substances.\nProbably the only theories which do not would be those forms of logical positivism or pragmatism which treat ontology as a matter of convention.\nAccording to such theories, there are no real facts about what is ontologically basic, and so nothing is objectively substance.", "This line of thought opened the way to atomism and to treating the unity of wholes as a matter of convention or degree.\nBuridan, who represents a further development in this direction, says In this sense, I am not the same as I was yesterday, because something was part of my integrity yesterday, which has already been used up, and something was not part of my integrity, which has meanwhile been added by nourishment.", "The traditional rationale of Locke\u2019s doctrine of \u2018substance in generalis as follows.\nProperties\u2014or, in Locke\u2019s terms qualities\u2014must belong to something\u2014\u2018cannot subsist\u2026without something to support them\u2019.\nOf course, they belong to objects, but what are objects over and above their properties?\nThe special category of substantial form, as found in Aristotle, is rejected.\nAll that seems to be left is a bare \u2018something\u2019, which on pain of regress, has no properties in its own right, except the property of being the owner or support of other properties.\nThis interpretation of Locke\u2019s notion of \u2018substance in generalis, however, a matter of controversy.\nIt is contested whether Locke actually believed in substance as a characterless substratum.\nAlthough the first quotation above seems to affirm it, Locke also in the same section speaks disparagingly about the idea, comparing it to the notion that the world rests on an elephant, which rests on a tortoise, and so on: in other words, as not constituting a real explanation at all.", "Locke\u2019s \u2018particular substancesare kinds which are individuated conventionally, and so are not real substantial kinds, by Aristotelian standards.\nBut Locke is not without substance other than substratum, for his real essence\u2014that is, the atoms and their structures\u2014are his real substances, and what we say above about the substantiality of atoms also goes for Locke.\nIt is plausible to maintain the general thesis that there are many issues on which Hume was a sceptic or nihilist, but where his legacy is more reductionist than sceptical or nihilist.", "One possible resort is to treat solidity as the core or master quality and all the others as features of it.\nOne would never ask what binds together a patch of colour and its shape, because the shape is the shape of the colour patch, and, though the shape of something can change, its shape cannot come away from it, like a separable component.\nPerhaps the shape, size and density of an atom are similarly features of the solidity.\nThe quality solidity would then become equivalent to the notion of material stuff or material substance and Locke shows no sign of wanting to elide the ideas of quality and substance in this way, though it should be noted that this is what Descartes does with extension.\nBecause he does not believe in void, extension carries with it the other basic properties of matter as features of it.", "Descartes believed in only two kinds of substance: material body, which is defined by extension, and mental substance, which is defined by thought, which, in this context, is more or less equivalent to consciousness.\nDescartes (like Aristotle and unlike most of his contemporaries and immediate successors) was not an atomist.\nHe did not believe in a void between bodies, so there is a sense in which there is just one material substance, numerically as well as specifically.", "If properties are conceived of as individuals\u2014otherwise known as tropes, property-instances or individualized forms\u2014then there cannot be a problem about the distinctness of exactly similar bundles, for the difference is built into the identity of the elements of the bundle, as it is not if the bundle is made of universals.\nThe problem for this version of the bundle theory seems to be that it is difficult to individuate or distinguish tropes in a way that makes them suitable to be individuals\u2014in one sense, the substances\u2014from which objects are made.", "As Mackie (2000) points out, the full statement of this theory involves various relatively ad hoc restrictions.\nMore importantly, it does not seem to explain what unifies the category of substance, for it does not say that it is true of any substance that it could conceivably be the only substance existing for a period of time\u2014indeed, it could not apply to non-atomic substances, for complex ones can exist only if other substances\u2014those that constitute their parts\u2014also exist.\nIt implies only that something from the category of substance might so exist and that this could not be true of any other category.\nOne might wonder what enabled substances that could not exist alone to count as substances at all.", "Wiggins\u2019s thesis is a very strong claim, apparently backed up by a powerful argument.\nIt is a strong claim for it purports to prove that any world with individuable objects must be constituted by Aristotelian substances.\nThe argument is powerful because it follows by simple logic, granted seemingly plausible claims about identity, and Leibniz\u2019s Law.", "One possible way out of this kind of case is to say that the sword is a phase of the walking stick, thereby introducing ad hoc phase sortals.\nBy the expression \u2018ad hoc phase sortalI mean a sortal that can be used sometimes as a phase sortal, designating an object only through part of its existence, and sometimes as an ultimate sortal, designating an object through the whole of its existence.", "First, it has the intuitive disadvantage that it allocates two solid physical objects to the same place.\nEach of them weighs, say, ten pounds, yet the total of their weight is only ten pounds.\nIt might seem natural to think\u2014and it was formerly a well established maxim\u2014that there can be only one solid physical thing at one place at a given time.\nSomeone impressed by the idea that two bodies cannot be in the same place at the same time might think it more natural to say that there are two different ways of conceptualizing the material presence at that point, than that there are two material things.", "So each monad reflects the whole system, but with its own perspective emphasised.\nIf a monad is at place p at time t, it will contain all the features of the universe at all times, but with those relating to its own time and place most vividly, and others fading out roughly in accordance with temporal and spatial distance.", "So that, even though particular objects are subject to degeneration and decay, the species as such are eternal.\nSecond, generation and decay depend on the material component in composites.\nAny form that does not require matter for its activity will be eternal by nature.\nThis applies to the active intellect, which is an essential feature of all human intellects, and to the immaterial movers of the cosmos described in Metaphysics, Book Lambda.", "If this were true, material objects would be modes of space-time.\nThe analogy would be more exact if one also thought of the laws of nature as equivalent to the divine intellect immanent in nature.\nSpinoza\u2019s view represents the extreme end of stressing the status of substance as the fundamental existent conceived of as wholly necessary and self-subsistent: that is, criteria (i) and (ii) in the original list come to take on maximum weight.", "Plato rejected these materialist attempts to explain everything on the basis of that of which it was made.\nAccording to Plato, the governing principles were the intelligible Forms which material objects attempted to copy.\nThese Forms are not substances in the sense of being either the stuff or the individuals or the kinds of individuals out of which all else is constructed.\nRather they are the driving principles which give structure and purpose to everything else.\nIn itself, the rest would be, at most, an unintelligible chaos.\nThe Forms meet criterion (i)\u2014ontological basicness\u2014but in a slightly eccentric way, because they do not, in a normal sense, constitute things.\nThey meet (ii)\u2014durability\u2014in a strong fashion, for they are eternal.\nThey are not, in the intended senses, the subjects of predication, and in no sense the subjects of change, so they do badly on (iii) and (iv).\nThey do not do well on (v) for they are not individual things in any normal sense, though they are individuals, of a very unusual kind.\n(Aristotle\u2019s main criticism of Plato\u2019s Forms was that they are a bastard confusion of universal and particular.\nSee Fine (1993).)\nThey are in no way kinds of stuff, hence failing (vi).\nBut failure to meet these standards is not carelessness on Plato\u2019s part.\nIt reflects his emphasis on criterion (i), together with his particular view about the way in which forms are basic.", "Different properties might have been hung on this hook.\nIt is not so clear, by contrast, that a substratum of the kind Locke considers, or like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter, is a particular in this sense.\nIt is more like a kind of stuff\u2014the substantiveness on to which properties are stuck.\nOn this conception, the suggestion that the \u2018pieceof substratum or \u2018prime matterthat is here in object a, might always instead have been there in object b, seems to lack content.", "It also avoids the need to employ the \u2018\u201cis\u201d of constitutionto link sortals and particulars, like lumps and hunks, rather than just mass terms, such as \u2018clayor \u2018gold\u2019.\nThe case where the lump and the sortally individuated object do not coincide, applies only to some problematic artefactual cases, and in those cases the sortal name of the artefact will not be suitable substitute for F, but the \u2018lumpexpression will be.\nIn that way, it will be possible to avoid the need to have two material objects in the same place.", "To see how this may come about, we must consider the rationale for Ayers\u2019s theory.\nThe fact that sortals do not seem to follow the discipline that Wiggins wishes for them might be taken to support the view that substances can be individuated under much more generic notions, such as same body or same material thing.\n(Ayers 1991a).\nOn this view, material cohesion is what picks out paradigmatic physical things.\nWiggins regards these ideas as too generic to be adequate on their own.\nSuch a concept cannot be understood except as determinable that has dog, horse, ball, [etc] among its determinations.\n(1997: 417\u20138)", "Substantive theories take the thought of a further component seriously, and, though they do not seem to be generally distinguished, there are two main conceptions of this extra element, which I will call the \u2018thin particularand the \u2018substratumconceptions.\n\u2018Thin particularis an expression of D. M. Armstrong\u2019s.\nIt is the particular in abstraction from its properties.\nWhen considered with its properties it is a thick particular.\nThe important point is that thin particulars really are particulars.\n\u2018Bertrand Russell might have been a fried egg\u2019: that is, the thin particular associated with one set of properties and, hence, with one thing, might have belonged to another.", "Both these forms of pessimism proved largely unfounded.\nThe consequence of this is the possibility of bringing together real essence and the sortal concepts originally picked out by a nominal essence.\nWe now know water to be H2O and iron to be the element of atomic weight 56.\nOur substance concepts were, often at least, tracking real essences in the world.\nThis involves reinterpreting the rationale of our substance concepts.\nLocke thought that our concept of gold was properly expressed as \u2018anything gold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia\u2019.", "If it is not natural to think of objects as having objects as their temporal parts, this seems to commit one to thinking of objects as wholly present at all times of their existence, strange though this form of expression may also be.\nThe difference between substances, events and properties can now be expressed as follows.\nSubstances and events are distinguished from properties by the fact that properties are the kinds of things the instances of which depend for their existence on the particular substance or event by which they are instantiated, whereas substances and events are such as not to depend for their existence on particular instances of properties.", "This general thesis can be explained and illustrated by considering his treatment of substance, for it is a case in question.\nAccording to Hume, in the Treatise, our belief in substance is the result of a mistake or illusion.\nWhen we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the smooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the succession\u2026When we compare its situation after a considerable change the progress of the thought is broken; and consequently we are presented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which contradictions, the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and invisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these variations; and this unintelligible something it calls a substance, or original and first matter.", "Thus, a particular instance of colour cannot exist, and could not have existed, without the object of which it is the colour, but the object can exist without the colour instance, for it may change colour and remain the same object, or it could have had a different colour from the start.\nVarious problems can be raised for this account.\nThe most obvious is that it does not, as stated, distinguish between substances and events.\nSome property-instances belong to events rather than substances.\nThe performance of a symphony, for example, is an event, and it may possess the property, in one of its movements, of being allegro.", "But it is vital that the distinction between sortals, phase or ultimate, and expressions such as brown thing be clearly maintained, if the notion of sortal is to serve any formal purpose.\nMore importantly, that there are no ad hoc sortals is essential to the significance of the formal proof that there is no such thing as relative identity.", "Locke expresses this idea as follows: The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of those qualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist, sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia, which, according to the true import of the word, is in plain English, standing under or upholding.\n(II xxiii 2)", "According to Locke, we have two conceptions of substance.\nOne is a \u2018notion of pure substance in general(Essay II xxiii 2), the other \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substance(II xxiii 3).\nBoth these conceptions of substance provide difficulties of interpretation."]
