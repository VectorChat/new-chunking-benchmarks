tribunal at the Hague.", "The worst of the horrors has been the systematic use of organized, repeated mass rape by Serbian militias of non-Serbian, mostly Muslim women as a part of \"ethnic cleansing.\"\nTo be sure, there have been cases of rape by all sides, and the UN has documented that Croats and Muslims have committed massacres and run concentration camps.\nWhat was unprecedented was the organization of mass rape as a matter of policy in a manner that could not have been unknown to the highest military and political authorities of the so-called Serbian Republic of Bosnia.", "Few other issues have become as highly charged as rape in the former Yugoslavia.\nDuring the war in Bosnia, Serbian forces were accused of systematically raping women as a deliberate tactic of war, a particularly cruel means, human rights investigators said, of terrorizing and demoralizing one's enemy.\nBosnian Serbs were accused of operating \"rape camps\" where Muslim women were held captive and repeatedly assaulted by Serbian soldiers.", "During the 1992 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina thousands of women were forced into \"rape camps\" by Serbian militia.\nThe accounts received by the Pentagon are backed up by similar reports of systematic rape now emerging from Kosovo refugees who have fled the province.\n...\nConsistent accounts are emerging of soldiers separating women from groups of refugees, apparently with the intention of raping them.", "The emphasis in the first passage is on the presence and newsworthiness of \"many\" women and children (which is, after all, what one would expect in any demographically-representative population).\nIn the second, the cowardliness of the Serb forces is exemplified by their murder of every element of the civilian population except \"battle-age\" males.\nThe manifestly most vulnerable demographic is the only one not represented in the formulation- except insofar as the killing of defenseless battle-age men is seen as a legitimate test of the Yugoslav army's power and machismo.", "Before we set off they set fire to our cars and tractors and ordered us to march in columns.\nThey also took away all the males aged 15 or over.\nCrinkle-haired Afertita Kajtazi, 23, her eyes ringed with fatigue, said their treatment was deliberately harsh.", "Consider, for example, the following reports: Yugoslav forces use ancient ways to break civilian spirits Throughout history rape has been one of the most common but least documented acts of violence committed during wartime.\nYet it has been an inescapable aspect of many conflicts, from the rape of the Sabine women in Ancient Rome to the allegations that the Serbs set up 'rape camps' during the recent war in Bosnia.", "The rape of the small number of women at the camp was certainly generalized and atrocious.", "Special squads of inmates were ordered to load their corpses on to trucks.", "One can see glimmers of comprehension in the occasional references to a pattern of male-selective killing in the Balkans conflict, and the attention paid to the phenomenon of male detentions and disappearances after the release of the inmates from Smrekovnica and Liplje prisons in May 1999 (see below).\nBut the coverage in no way approximated the kind of nuanced historical analysis that imbued treatments of Kosovo's women rape victims.", "Helsinki Watch wrote in Volume II of their study of War Crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina that Omarska indeed \"appears to have been the most brutal of the four Serbian-operated camps that were discovered by the press during the summer of 1982.\nAlmost all former Omarska detainees interviewed by Helsinki Watch claimed that they had been bestially beaten, that scores had died from the beatings and that some were executed.\"\nThere is no evidence that any of the women at Omarska were killed.", "The trend has been persistently evident in media coverage of the Bosnian war, as a report as recent as October 1999 makes plain: Bosnian forensic teams have exhumed 251 bodies, mainly of Muslim civilians, in the Serb-run half of Bosnia in the last two weeks..\nThe bodies, victims of the 1992-95 Bosnian war, were exhumed from more than 14 mass graves each containing up to 15 corpses, as well as individual graves..\nThe majority, including 12 women and five children, were executed by Bosnian Serb forces who had captured these regions at the beginning of the war..\nSome 3,000 people, mainly Muslims, were still missing in northwestern Bosnia.", "The excerpts came eight paragraphs into the story, and the \"striking\" subject was then dropped.\nCertainly it was never deemed worthy of a story in its own right.\nThe flicker of a higher-order gendering (that is, the isolation of a pattern, and the citing of the Bosnian precedent) was about as faint as could be.", "The answers: some were in hiding, some were joining the fight against the Serbs, and others had been detained and led away to destinations

headline focusing on 'The Men' in Kosovo at any point in the two months of Times coverage preceding the mass release from Smrekovnica.", "In stark contrast, I have never seen a detailed third-order treatment of the gendercidal killings of males in Kosovo, let alone one with a historical scope comparable to the first excerpt.\nBut the slaughter of \"battle-age\" non-combatant men is at least as prominent and enduring a \"weapon of war,\" in the Balkans and throughout history, as is the rape of women- and a more brutal and severe one, by any reasonable standard.", "The guards responsible for this barbarism were described by one witness as \"like a crowd at a sporting match.\"\nAnother man was forced to bark like a dog and lick at motor oil on the ground while a guard jumped up and down on his back until it snapped.\nPrisoners, who survived by drinking their own and each other's urine, were constantly being called out of their cramped quarters, by name.\nSome would return caked in

should be noted that the charge formed part of the Criminal Tribunal indictment of Dusko Tadi, the director of evening torture sessions at Omarska, captured in Munich and turned over to the Tribunal in 1994.\nSee Junger, 1999: 154.\nThe designation of Omarska as the 'most brutal' of the Serb-run death camps is relative, of course.\nThe most famous symbol of Omarska the emaciated Bosnian prisoner Fikret Ali, who appeared in numerous photographs behind the barbed wire of the camp on liberation day- was a recent arrival from Keraterm, where, Vulliamy notes, 'he had witnessed the murder of 200 men in one night' (Vulliamy, 1998: 74).", "The gendering of the massacre victims and concentration-camp inmates was fairly well established by this point (1994), but Denitch reserves the very \"worst\" designation for the mass rapes of women, rather than the \"vast and well-documented massacres of mostly Muslim civilians,\" overwhelmingly males.", "But by what standard is Omarska \"particularly.. notorious\" for the rape of its women detainees, when thousands of civilian males were viciously tortured, hundreds killed- and almost certainly a great many more raped and sexually abused than women, given the unbridled sexual sadism that pervaded the camp?\nV.

was again confronted, in Post coverage, with only glancing references to \"men missing\" and \"summary executions of men,\" except on the rare occasions when policymakers stressed the particular vulnerability of \"battle-age\" males.", "Here the \"genocidal cull of ethnic-Albanian males\" takes place in the blink of an eye, amidst a torrent of frankly lachrymose descriptions of the convoys of helpless \"worthies.\"\nA second strategy is displacement.\nHere, the male is defined by some trait or label other than gender- even when gender obviously, or apparently, is decisive in shaping the experience or predicament being described.\nDuring the Kosovo war, typical displacement terminology included designations such as \"Kosovars,\" \"ethnic Albanians,\" \"bodies,\" \"victims,\" and \"people.\"", "While feminist research in this area is to be commended and learned from, it has also contributed to a one-sided depiction of the atrocities of war that tends to consign the male victim to oblivion.\nConsider the evaluation of the Bosnian war by Bogdan Denitch, otherwise one of the most clear-eyed appraisers of Yugoslavia's collapse: It is there [Bosnia] that by far the worst atrocities have taken place.\nNot only have there been vast and well-documented massacres of mostly Muslim civilians by Serbian militias, but concentration camps and massive forcible population transfers, known as \"ethnic cleansing,\" have also been used to change the demographic realities of Bosnia.", "13.\nOblivious to the contradiction, Janowski mentions later in the article: 'Women are telling stories of their men being tortured and shot.\nIt's completely out of control.'\n14.\nIn this light, it is interesting to note that the cover of Denitch's book is an AP photo captioned as follows: 'Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Nov. 10 [1993].\n'Last Farewell.'\nA man puts his hands on the window of a bus to give his wife and son a last farewell in Sarajevo.\nMore than 1,000 people who

the displacement strategy employed during the war came in mid-April, when the subject of Kosovar men used as forced labourers surfaced in press briefings and subsequent media coverage.\nThe BBC began its report on \"Kosovo 'grave gangs'\" with the claim that \"Kosovo Albanians dressed in red [were] being forced to move dead bodies and dig graves\"- a strange emphasis, given the subsequent acknowledgment that these crimson-clad Kosovars were all \"men and boys.\"", "Few reliable figures exist for the incidence of rape in wartime before the Balkan wars this decade but anecdotal evidence suggests that it was widespread.\nIt has been alleged that Nazi troops indulged in mass rape during the second world war, particularly on the eastern front where Jewish, Gypsy, Polish and Russian women were all subject to systematic sexual violence.", "Reporting David Scheffer's comments on the massacre at Velika Krusa, where (as the story notes) \"Yugoslav troops gunn[ed] down more than 100 men and boys between ages 14 and 50,\" The Washington Post added: \"At the Pentagon, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon revealed that U.S. officials had received reports of an even more ghastly crime of mass rape followed by executions\"- i.e., up to 20 deaths at the alleged \"rape camp\" near Djakovica.\nTwenty raped and murdered women was \"even more ghastly\" than 100 men shot and burned to death- some indication of the relative value of the worthy versus unworthy victims.", "The conclusions that can and should be drawn from this body of evidence and argument depend very much on whether one views males as \"natural\" targets of victimization, and therefore irrelevant and unnewsworthy; or whether, on the other hand, one sees them as equally deserving of attention and protection in the face of violent assaults, up to and including genocidal mass killing.\nMy own preferences are no doubt apparent.\nIn my opinion, no meaningful claim to humanity, fairness, or analytical accuracy can be advanced by those who, consciously or unconsciously, would consign half the human race to second-class status in the humanitarian and policy equation.", "For the most part, the civilian male victims of the slaughter were buried in a slew of other designations- \"Kosovar,\" \"ethnic-Albanian,\" etc.\n-- and their specific vulnerabilities were thereby blurred into the larger backdrop of ethnic conflict.\nNeither The New York Times nor The Washington Post- the two major \"agenda-setting\" newspapers in the United States published a single story or editorial focusing on the phenomenon of gender-selective mass executions.", "A scholarly analysis that confines itself to first-order analyses may turn up extraordinarily useful and important material.\nBut such analyses cannot buttress reality-claims beyond their own pre-set boundaries.\nIf, then, we find that there is a consistent and systematic according of second- and third-order framings to the experiences of one gender group, and a near-total absence of such framings for the other, there may be grounds for intellectual concern.", "The release of about two thousand men from Smrekovnica and other Serb detention facilities, in late May 1999, marked the one occasion on which victimized males came to the forefront of the discussion.\nThe result was some solid and nuanced reporting of the men's experiences.\nThis came very late in the game, however, and it was notable how infrequently terms like \"torture\" were applied to the men's experiences.\nMore common were phrases like \"mistreatment,\" \"maltreatment,\" \"beatings,\" \"abuse\"- all of which seems inadequate to capture the sadism of the Serb jailers (akin, perhaps, to describing rape as \"unwanted sexual attention\").\nIt was equally striking that what second-order gendering there was of the prison releases- that is, coverage referring to a pattern of gender-selective detentions and disappearances in Kosovo- suggested that a quandary or \"mystery\" somehow had been solved by the release of the men.", "Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said.. \"This is a very eerie and disturbing echo of documented instances of rape and killing of women in Bosnia during the Bosnia war and it is obviously outrageous that this is occurring.\"", "But men remain the \"absent subjects,\" entering the narrative only indirectly and by inference, if at all.", "This depiction of the horrors of Omarska- one of the three concentration camps closed after international protests in late 1992- is a mind-bogglingly casual inversion of the gendered reality.\nHelsinki Watch gave the population of Omarska as 2,000 men and 33 to 38 women.\nIn an article for International Affairs on \"The Crime of Appeasement in Bosnia,\" Ed Vulliamy, who witnessed the release of Omarska's survivors, wrote: Omarska had been a place where a prisoner was forced to bite the testicles off a fellow inmate who, as he died of pain, had a live pigeon stuffed into his mouth to stifle his screams.", "I have found specific mention of one female killed- 18-year-old Hanushune Mehmeti (apparently the \"adult female shot in the back\"), who was

Clearly, there were many young men involved in the UCK [Kosovo Liberation Army].. but every young Kosovo Albanian man was suspected of being a terrorist.\nIf apprehended by Serbian forces- VJ [Yugoslav army], police or paramilitary- the young men were at risk, more than any other group of Kosovo society, of grave human rights violations.\nMany were executed on the spot, on occasion after horrendous torture.\nSometimes they would be arrested and taken to prisons or other detention centres, where, as described afterwards by men released from such detention, they would be tortured and ill-treated, while others would simply not be seen again.\nOthers were taken for use as human shields or as forced labour.\nMany young men \"disappeared\" following abduction.", "In the light of these manifest realities, the \"emptying\" motif seems nothing short of Orwellian- an excellent example of the kind of conceptual vacuum into which Kosovar males fell during the war.", "Ninety-three percent adult male casualties.\nBut this fact passes unmentioned in the rush to draw attention to the \"worthy\" victims.\nLiterally dozens of examples of this strategy could be cited from the wartime and postwar coverage of Kosovo: In Velika Krusa, Dutch soldiers yesterday reported finding charred remains of around 20 ethnic Albanians, including women and children, and said they expect to find more nearby.", "The passage appeared nine paragraphs into the story.\n19.\nI have attempted no broad sampling of broadcast media in this study.\nBut I feel I should point to CNN's Christiane Amanpour as unusual among such media workers in her early attention to the phenomenon of the missing men.\nReporting from the refugee camps in Albania on 30 March 1999, Amanpour asked straightforwardly: 'Where are the men?'\nYoung men, she said, were notably underrepresented in the refugee convoys: there were 'very few men coming out.. the tractor-trailers are full of women and children.'\nAmanpour said she asked the occupants of the refugee convoys about the fate of the men.", "One other Globe article, by Geoffrey York, deserves honourable mention for a forceful second-order gendering.\nYork zeroed in on the firestorm that had descended upon Kosovar males: Most of the refugees who arrived yesterday [4 May] were women, children, and the elderly.\nYoung men were conspicuously absent.\nMany of the refugees were exhausted, crying, and obviously in shock.\nThey said Serb police had taken away hundreds of young men from the refugee convoys.", "The Post's eagerness to find \"worthy\" victims among the carnage leads to their conjuring by the dozens out of whole cloth.\nNor is this a matter of simple historical accuracy.\nIt amounts to a misrepresentation of the essence of the slaughter at Racak- which was a harbinger of the hundreds, possibly thousands, of individual acts of gendercide against Kosovar males between March and June 1999.", "Splashes of blood are still visible on the lower portion of a door at a pizzeria in Suva Reka, where up to 50 people, including women and children, are believed to have been slaughtered.\nSince starting work on 18 June, the UK forensic team has exhumed over 260 bodies of Kosovar civilians from mass graves, including women and the remains of 21 children..", "This analysis should not close without attending to one of the most extraordinary English-language media commentaries during the war- one that stands, given its author's prominence, somewhere between an opinion-editorial article and an insider contribution to the policy discussion.\nThis was a piece by Daniel Ellsberg in The New York Times- the daily which in 1970 had broken one of the biggest political stories of the postwar era by publishing the \"Pentagon Papers\" that Ellsberg, a renegade Defense and State Department official, fed it.\nEllsberg's article was entitled \"Contemplating A Fatal Mistake.\"\n(Ellsberg, 1999.)\nIt was unique, in the range of materials I consulted, in focusing on the situation within Kosovo; examining the specific vulnerabilities of men, among others; and arguing that these considerations should govern NATO policymaking.\nEllsberg applauded the passing reference to the situation within Kosovo in a pro-intervention \"open letter\" signed by luminaries including Zbigniew Brzezinski, Saul Bellow, and Susan Sontag.\nThe signatories had stressed the necessity of \"saving the lives of the nearly one million Kosovars now facing death from starvation and murder within Kosovo.\"", "The point can be buttressed with a further example from Kosovo reporting.\nOne of the most widely-noted acts of gendercide during the war was the massacre at Izbica in early April.\nThe Christian Science Monitor (1999) related the events in only slightly less distorted a fashion than did the Post in reporting Racak: \"The Monitor tracked down three men who in separate interviews insisted they were among 60 or 70 people who helped to bury the dead.\nOne gave the number of victims as 148, with two survivors; the others spoke of 150, including several women..\" (emphasis added).", "The comments, and similar ones, invite two questions.\nFirst, where were the specific expressions of \"fear\" and \"concern,\" the posing of \"one of the scarier questions,\" the references to the \"chilling puzzle,\" two months or one month earlier, when they might have made a difference?\nAnd how did the release of a mere 1,000 men (later increased to 2,000) obviate, or even meaningfully mitigate, the possibility that \"many [men] were dead, locked in camps, or being held by the Serbs as human shields,\" as The Washington Post put it?\nThe releases were used as an excuse to declare a general relief and go home, analytically speaking.\nThe men still left behind, at Smrekovnica and elsewhere, would become subjects of analysis and concern only after the war, when thousands of them were spirited away to unknown fates in Serbia.\nThen, suddenly and rather bizarrely, there was a spate of high-sounding articles and expressions of concern, such as this editorial from The Washington Post: For a sizable but unknown number of [Kosovars].. return still is not possible.\nMany Kosovars, particularly men, are being held captive inside Serbia.\nSerbian officials have told the Red Cross that they are holding more than 2,000; according to other estimates, the number may be 5,000 or even greater.\nSome have been prisoners for many months.. Others were studying or working in Belgrade when NATO began bombing in March and were promptly rounded up.\nAnd many are believed to have been trucked across the border as Serbian forces retreated earlier this month.\nGiven the Serbian torture chambers NATO troops have discovered in Kosovo, no one can feel easy about the detainees' condition.\nA few days ago Serbian authorities released 166 of these prisoners, gaunt but alive.\nThe rationale for the small release is as unclear as the motivation for keeping the larger number.\nMr. Milosevic seems to have planned the destruction of ethnic Albanian Kosovo as a working society.\nThe imprisonment of some Kosovo men, like the killings and forced expulsion of others, was undoubtedly part of this plan.\n...\nThe war is not over until Mr. Milosevic accounts for the Kosovars he has kidnapped and allows them to go home.\n(The Washington Post, 1999b; emphasis added.)\nAgain, where was the editorial on the \"imprisonment of Kosovo men\" and the \"killings and forced expulsion of others\" two months earlier, when it might have helped to arouse concern and influence the policy agenda?", "Aid workers said the refugee accounts strongly suggested that the Serbs have massacred more of Kosovo's young men.\n\"The common thread in their stories is that a lot of young men have been taken off the tractors or taken away before the tractors left,\" said Ray Wilkinson, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency.\n\"They're talking about killings again.\nA wide area of Kosovo is being cleaned out.\nMen are being taken away and possibly killed.\"", "A moment's thought reveals the fallaciousness of the framing.\nQuite clearly, Kosovo was being \"emptied\" in manner that was highly selective according first to ethnicity- as was generally acknowledged- and secondly to gender, which rarely was.\nRather than being allowed to seek refuge, a substantial portion of the civilian male population was falling prey to a \"genocidal cull,\" and tens of thousands of others were in hiding, at mortal risk of roundup by the Serbs.", "As the Kosovar men buried the dead, so were they largely buried in the policy equation and public discussion.\nThe Press Association report managed to go its entire length with the gender of the chain-ganged gravediggers unmentioned, although the colour of the prisoners' dress was noted twice, and the children, mother, and grandmother among a group of refugee landmine victims (the main focus of the story) were carefully designated.\nThe third marginalization strategy is simply exclusion.\nThe trope most commonly adopted here can be summarized in the little-examined phrase, \"including women\"- or, equally commonly, \"including women and children.\"", "Similar stories are starting to emerge from ethnic Albanian refugees who have crossed from Kosovo into Albania and Macedonia in recent weeks.\nWestern officials and human rights groups say that scores of women have reported being raped since the Belgrade government started waging all-out war in Kosovo against separatist rebels and ethnic Albanian civilians supporting rebel demands for independence.", "Speaking of the entire month-long sample, I found only one article, by Alan Freeman of The Globe and Mail, that actually focused on the mass detention and apparent gender-selective killing of Kosovar males.\nBy \"focusing,\" I mean with both a headline and a lead that alludes to the subject.\nIt appeared in The Globe on 6 April, and deserves to be cited at length:", "Some generalizations may be advanced on the basis of this extensive, if not rigorously systematic, sampling of Kosovo coverage.\nThe first is that males tend to assume the status of \"non-persons\" in analyses and reportage of conflict and genocide.\nMost commonly, they are effaced from the picture.\nIf their presence is noted at all, it is likely to be obliquely, with the gender variable subsumed by others (e.g., race/ethnicity, nationality, abstract \"victim\" status, colour of clothing).", "In this context, consider Daniel Williams' report in The Washington Post on the mass murder at Istok prison, a facility bombed by NATO planes in late May 1999.\nAfter the last of three bombing raids, the Serbs paraded 19 male corpses before western media, declaring that they were the bodies of prisoners killed by NATO.\nIt now appears likely that many of these men, along with up to 100 others, were massacred by the Serbs in one of the war's larger acts of gendercide.\nHere is how Williams reported the Serbs' propaganda show: Bodies of dead prisoners were shown to reporters lying around the prison courtyard Saturday [22 May], and on Monday [24 May] another group of corpses inside a foyer entrance to a cellblock.\nDespite the presence of 1,000 mostly ethnic Albanian prisoners, [NATO] bombed it twice Saturday and once early Sunday.\nNo one seemed to take into account the possible extra danger to the prisoners.. 19 bodies of prisoners lay in and around the courtyard, and on Monday those bodies lay in the same spots.. An inspecting magistrate said the bodies were left outside because he had not had time to carry out his work, what with all the bombing.\n... Then there was the new group of dead on display Monday.. Twenty-five bodies in the foyer, some lined up on top of one another domino-style, many with streaks of blood on their bodies..\nThese corpses were not dusty.\n... No one seemed to know why the 19 Saturday bodies were left outside, but..", "II.\n\"Including Women,\" Excluding Men In their groundbreaking work, Manufacturing Consent, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky devoted a chapter to the subject of \"Worthy and Unworthy Victims\" in media coverage.\n(Herman and Chomsky, 1988: 37-86.)\nThey presented a comparative treatment of the intensity and character of media coverage of victims who were convenient for U.S. policymakers- Cambodians under the communist Pol Pot; the Polish priest, Jerzy Popieluszko, murdered by Polish security agents- contrasted with inconvenient victims, such as the slaughtered and systematically starved inhabitants of East Timor (invaded by a U.S. ally, Indonesia), or one hundred religious workers killed by U.S.-sponsored terror regimes in Central America.\nComparing directly the coverage of the priest Popieluszko with the mass of \"inconvenient\" religious workers (including a Salvadorean archbishop and four US nuns raped and murdered by Salvadorean soldiers in 1980), Herman and Chomsky concluded: For every media category, the coverage of the worthy victim, Popieluszko, exceeded that of the entire set of one hundred unworthy victims taken together.\nWe suspect that the coverage of Popieluszko may have exceeded that of all the many hundreds of religious victims murdered in Latin America since World War II, as the most prominent are included in our hundred.. [W]e can also calculate the relative worthiness of the world's victims, as measured by the weight given them by the US mass media.\nThe worth of the victim Popieluszko is valued at somewhere between 137 and 179 times that of a victim in the US client states; or, looking at the matter in reverse, a priest murdered in Latin America is worth less than a hundredth of a priest murdered in Poland.\n(Herman and Chomsky, 1988: 39.)\nThe concept of \"worthy\" versus \"unworthy\" victims seems a fertile one in analyzing the treatment of the victims of the gendercidal atrocities in Kosovo, and male victims of violence more generally.\n(5) In this section, I sketch some of the predictable, even ritualized, means by which \"unworthy\" male victims were excluded from the analysis, and \"worthy\" ones notably children and women- privileged.\n(6) The effacing of male victims in mass media is generally accomplished by three interrelated strategies.\nThe first might be called incidentalizing.\nModern news, as noted, is a hierarchical creature.\nIt generally \"leads\" with the dominant theme of the article, which the headline is also meant to convey.\nMany newspapers, printing or reprinting an article or wire-service report, will include only (a version of) the headline and the first several paragraphs of the story.\nThus, to relegate an important theme to passing mention in the middle reaches of the article, or to introduce it only at the end, is effectively to render it incidental and inconspicuous, if not outright invisible.\nConsider, for example, the strategy adopted in the following Agence France-Presse dispatch (emphasis added): The Death March of the Kosovo Refugees MORINA, Albania, April 18 (AFP)- Among the thousands of refugees fleeing Kosovo, none suffer worse than those forced to travel for days and nights on end on foot.\nWhile many cross the border into Albania and Macedonia in cars or open trailers drawn by tractors, the rest have had to walk, harried by Serbian troops on what for some became a death march.\nStaggering up to the red barrier marking the frontier, carrying children and baggage, and supporting the elderly, they sob as they gulp down food offered by humanitarian organisations.\nTheir accounts, consistent, precise and detailed, describe a Kosovo that has been turned into a hell, criss-crossed day and night by columns of refugees expelled from the Serbian province in ferocious \"ethnic cleansing.\"\n\"We walked almost without stopping for four days and four nights,\" groaned Hysnije Abazi, 22, from Kladernica in central Kosovo.\n\"We were escorted all the time by Serbs in vehicles or on foot.\nWe were not allowed to drink, stop, rest or shelter from the rain.", "This dubious hierarchizing of human suffering was implicit throughout much of the discussion of the rape controversy during the Kosovo war.\nFor example, James Rubin on 13 April called for Yugoslavia to \"take immediate steps to punish the perpetrators of rape and other crimes..\" (Rubin quoted in Agence France-Presse, 1999c.)", "Remarkably, in the entire Monitor story, it was nowhere stated that this \"worst massacre known in Kosovo\" was a truly towering act of gender-selective slaughter.", "This article has argued that an alternative framework is possible, and needs to be adopted rapidly to ensure that all victims of violence receive the empathy, attention, and assistance they require.\nBooks about Kosovo from Amazon.com NOTE: If the box instead shows generic Amazon information, please click the \"Refresh\" button on your browser.", "The Post, for its part, did publish an editorial, \"Captive in Serbia,\" pointing out that \"Many Kosovars, particularly men, are being held captive,\" and referring to \"the imprisonment of some Kosovo men\" as \"undoubtedly part\" of a \"planned.. destruction of ethnic Albanian Kosovo as a working society.\"", "Fighting in built-up areas, NATO troops would probably be fired on from buildings that were packed on every floor with Kosovar women and children.\nUsing the traditional means- explosives, artillery and rockets- to destroy those buildings would make NATO forces the mass executioners of the people we were fighting to protect.\nI believe these reasons alone are enough to rule out the option of a ground invasion.\nMerely preparing for such an invasion, which many have urged as a way to threaten Mr. Milosevic, would give him an urgent incentive to exterminate remaining male Kosovars in Kosovo.\nCarrying out the threat would eliminate most of the women and children.\n...\nDistasteful as it is to bargain with Mr. Milosevic, the fact is that he holds a million hostages.\nThere is only one way for NATO to stop the ethnic cleansing, avert even worse slaughter and permit refugees to return safely.\nThat is to negotiate as quickly as possible the immediate, unopposed introduction of a large international security force into Kosovo, capable of protecting the Albanians there as long as needed.", "However one evaluates the accuracy of Ellsberg's analysis of the situation inside Kosovo (and I believe it will stand as very accurate), and whatever one thinks of the recommendation to open negotiations with Milo\u0161evi\u0107, there was nothing remotely comparable to Ellsberg's sophisticated analysis and insight in any other commentary sampled for this study.\nA full sensitivity was evident to both the gender and age variables as they had shaped the atrocities so far.\nSomething of the process and periodicity of slaughter that often occurs in these cases was acknowledged (i.e., with the reference that the destruction of Kosovar civilians could proceed in two phases, the \"threatening\" males first, then the \"women, children and old people\").", "After citing Boldrini, John Daniszewski wrote: \"Like many aid workers and journalists, Boldrini has observed that the overwhelming majority of refugees streaming in from Kosovo are female, and that those males who have made it through the gauntlet of Serbian checkpoints have tended to be the old and the very young.\n...\nAlong with persistent reports of summary executions and mass internments of young men inside Kosovo, the low number of ethnic Albanian men making it over the border since the exodus began last month has raised fears here.", "But the most astonishing reference in the Post story was to \"the [Yugoslav] government's role in the massacre of dozens of women and children at the Kosovo village of Racak\" in January 1999.\nThis is the prewar massacre for which international monitors gave a breakdown of 31 victims as follows: Twenty-three adult males of various ages.\nMany shot at extremely close range, most shot in the front, back and top of the head.\n... Three adult males shot in various parts of their body including their backs.\n... One adult male shot outside his house with his head missing.. One adult male shot in head and decapitated.\n... One adult female shot in the back.. One boy (12 years old) shot in the neck.\n... One male, late teens (shot in abdomen).", "And this, from the aftermath of the Kosovo war: Air Marshal Sir John Day, deputy to Britain's Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, said NATO was \"within days\" of making a formal decision on a ground invasion and was confident NATO would have approved.\nGuthrie told the allies the Yugoslav army was \"overrated\" and \"bully boys good at killing women, children and old people.\"", "One obvious victim is the prospect of a tolerable and decent life together after the war.", "Missing: Kosovo's young ethnic-Albanian men Women, children, aging men pouring over the borders; reports say 17-to-45 year olds massacred or in hiding KUKES, Albania- As UN aid worker Laura Boldrini surveyed the steady stream of refugees flowing over the border from Kosovo at the remote Qafa Prush border post, she thought she had been transported to another planet- \"a planet without men, only women and children.\"\n\"It was unbelievable,\" she said yesterday, estimated that 90 per cent of those crossing at the border point on Saturday were women, children and aging men.\n\"There were no men.\nThe old men were there, but I'm talking about young men between 17 and 45.\"", "Kosovo's young ethnic Albanian men are missing.\nThey are believed to have been massacred by Serbian forces or to have fled to the Kosovo hills, possibly joining the Kosovo Liberation Army.\nEyewitness reports collected from refugees show a pattern of killings of young male Kosovar Albanians.\nThey are reported to have been gunned down with automatic weapons, stripped naked and used as human shields or, in a case alleged yesterday, had their throats slashed at a mosque.\nMost of these reports cannot be verified.\nOne international aid worker, who asked not to be identified, said he fears that Kosovo has been turned into a giant killing field.", "Ellsberg understood that enormous numbers of people (tens if not hundreds of thousands) were at mortal risk.\nAnd most importantly, he argued that these factors were sufficient in themselves to rule out certain policies and warrant the adoption of others.\nIn so doing, he briefly raised factors, issues, and options above the din of meaningless and misleading chatter in media and policy circles.", "One of the most intriguing and revealing motifs deployed during the Kosovo war, both in policy statements and media commentary, was the notion that Kosovo was being \"emptied\" of its ethnic-Albanian population.\nThere could hardly be a more blatant contradiction between this theme of emptying/expulsion and the numerous passing references to mass detentions and executions of \"battle-age\" males.", "But many say they believe most military-aged men are hiding in the forests of Kosovo, either because they have joined the KLA or because they dared not accompany their families through police checkpoints for fear of being arrested or killed.", "The question, he argued, was \"whether a ground invasion would serve that goal or whether, as I believe, it would be a death sentence for most Albanians remaining in Kosovo.\"\nFrom there, Ellsberg moved into analytical territory charted by no other prominent commentator in the English language, to my knowledge: By all accounts, it would take weeks to months to deploy an invasion force to the region once the decision to do so was made, and Slobodan Milosevic already has troops there fortifying the borders.\nWouldn't the prospect of an invasion lead him to order his forces in Kosovo to kill all the military-age male Albanians and hold the rest of the population as hostages rather than continuing to deport them?\nWe do not know how many male Kosovars of military age- broadly, from 15 to 60 years old- have been killed already.\nBut even if the number is in the tens of thousands (NATO has conservatively estimated 4,600 civilian deaths), that would still mean that most of the men were still alive.\nFacing invasion, would Mr. Milosevic allow any more men to leave Kosovo to be recruited by the KLA, or to live to support the invasion?"]
