["The burning in 1789 of Christian Murphy, for coining, received practically no attention from the newspapers (perhaps owing to practical limitations on how much news they could publish across only four pages), but it may have been enacted by Sir Benjamin Hammett, a former sheriff of London.\nHammett was also an MP, and in 1790 he introduced to Parliament a Bill for Altering the Sentence of Burning Women.\nHe denounced the punishment as \"the savage remains of Norman policy\" which \"disgraced our statutes\", as \"the practice did the common law\".\nHe also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution.", "The change in execution venues, from Tyburn to Newgate, also attracted criticism.\nFollowing Phoebe Harris's burning in 1786, as well as questioning the inequality of English law The Times complained about the location of the punishment and its effect on locals: When remission of burning was refused, the scene of inhumanity should have been changed; the consequences have been serious; several persons in the neighbourhood of Newgate lying ill, have been severely affected by the smoke which issued from the body of the unhappy female victim.", "William Wilberforce and Hammett were not the first men to attempt to end the burning of women.\nAlmost 140 years earlier, during the Interregnum, a group of lawyers and laymen known as the Hale Commission (after its chairman Matthew Hale), was tasked by the House of Commons to take \"into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law\".\nAmong the proposed reforms was the replacement of burning at the stake with hanging, but, mainly through the objections of various interested parties, none of the commission's proposals made it into law during the Rump Parliament.\nHammett was confident though.\nHe believed that public opinion was on his side and that \"the House would go with him in the cause of humanity\".", "Another factor was the fate of Sophia Girton, found guilty of coining.\nHammett's bill was introduced only four days before Girton's fate was to be decided, but a petition for her respite from burning, supported by another sheriff of London (either Thomas Baker or William Newman) and brought to King George III's notice by William Grenville, proved successful.\nDevereaux suggests that her impending fate lent weight to the eventual outcome of Hammett's bill, which was to abolish the burning of women for treason through the Treason Act 1790.\nChristian Murphy, who at her execution in 1789 was \"drest in a clean striped gown, a white ribbon, and a black ribbon round her cap\", was the last woman in England to be burned.", "The newspaper asked \"why should the law in this species of offence inflict a severer punishment upon a woman, than upon a man\"?\nHarris's fate prompted William Wilberforce to sponsor a bill which, if passed, would have abolished the practice.\nBut as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers, the House of Lords rejected it.\nThough sympathetic to reform of England's Bloody Code, Lord Chief Justice Loughborough saw no need to change the law: \"Although the punishment, as a spectacle, was rather attended with circumstances of horror, likely to make a more strong impression on the beholders than mere hanging, the effect was much the same, as in fact, no greater degree of personal pain was sustained, the criminal being always strangled before the flames were suffered to approach the body\".", "The English jurist William Blackstone supposed that the difference in sentencing, although \" full as terrible to the sensation as the other \", could be explained by the desire not to publicly expose a woman's body.\nPublic executions were well @-@ attended affairs, and contemporary reports detail the cries of women on the pyre as they were burned alive.\nIt later became commonplace for the executioner to strangle the convict, and for the body to be burned post @-@ mortem.\nIn the latter half of the eighteenth century, changing attitudes to such public displays prompted Sir Benjamin Hammett MP to denounce the practice in Parliament.", "The Times incorrectly stated that Sullivan was burned alive, rhetoric which, in Dr Simon Devereaux's opinion, could be \"rooted in the growing reverence for domesticated womanhood\" that might have been expected at the time.\nAs many objections may also have been raised by the perceived iniquity of drawing and burning women for coining, whereas until 1783, when the halting of executions at Tyburn removed ritualistic dragging from public view, men were simply drawn and hanged.\nA widening gulf between the numbers of men and women whipped in London (during the 1790s, 393 men versus 47 women), which mirrors a similar decline in the sending of women to the pillory, may also indicate an imposition of commonly-held gender ideals on English penal practices.", "His bill, by no means the first such attempt to end the public burning of women, led to the Treason Act 1790, which abolished the sentence.\n= = Crimes punishable by burning = = = Treason = = = By the end of the thirteenth century, several offences against either one's lord, or one's king, were treasonable.\nHigh treason, defined as transgressions against the sovereign, was first codified during King Edward III's reign by the Treason Act 1351.", "About 30 minutes later, faggots were placed around the stake, her body was chained into position, and subsequently burned for over two hours.\nExecutions like this had once passed with little to no comment in the press.\nHistorically, while fewer women than men were subjected to capital punishment, proportionately more were acquitted, found guilty of lesser charges, or pardoned if condemned.\nIn centuries past, these women were judged by publications such as The Newgate Calendar to have succumbed to their own perversions, or to have been led astray.", "Fly agaric shamanism is also explored in the 2003 novel Thursbitch by Alan Garner.\n= Burning of women in England = In England, burning was a legal punishment inflicted on women found guilty of high treason, petty treason and heresy.\nOver a period of several centuries, female convicts were publicly burnt at the stake, sometimes alive, for a range of activities including coining and mariticide.\nWhile men guilty of heresy were also burned at the stake, those who committed high treason were instead hanged, drawn and quartered.", "Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as \"the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies\".\nHowever, an observation by historian Jules Michelet, that \"the first flame to rise consumed the clothes, revealing poor trembling nakedness\", may, in the opinion of historian Vic Gatrell, suggest that this solution is \"misconceived\".\nIn The Hanging Tree, Gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in Europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling, kicking female hanging from a noose could \"elicit obscene fantasies\" from watching males.", "Further molecular study by Geml and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oak \u2013 hickory \u2013 pine forest in the southeastern United States and two more on Santa Cruz Island in California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species; thus A. muscaria as it stands currently is evidently a species complex.\nThe complex also includes at least three other closely related taxa that are currently regarded as species: A. breckonii is a buff-capped mushroom associated with conifers from the Pacific Northwest, and the brown-capped A. gioiosa and A. heterochroma from the Mediterranean Basin and from Sardinia respectively.", "But while 18th and 19th-century women guilty of treasonable crimes were still seen as villains, increasingly, the cause of their descent was ascribed to villainous men.\nThose people concerned about the brutality inflicted on condemned women were, in Gatrell's opinion, \"activated by the sense that even at their worst women were creatures to be pitied and protected from themselves, and perhaps revered, like all women from whom men were born.\"\nCommenting on Harris's execution, The Daily Universal Register claimed that the act reflected \"a scandal upon the law\", \"a disgrace to the police\" and \"was not only inhuman, but shamefully indelicate and shocking\".", "The episode received mixed reviews from television critics.", "Burning alive for murder was abolished in 1656, although burning for adultery remained.\nThereafter, out of mercy, the condemned were often strangled before the flames took hold.\nNotable exceptions to this practice were the burnings in 1685 and 1726 of Elizabeth Gaunt, found guilty of high treason for her part in the Rye House Plot, and Catherine Hayes, for petty treason.\nHayes apparently \"rent the air with her cries and lamentations\" when the fire was lit too early, preventing the executioner from strangling her in time.\nShe became the last woman in England to be burned alive.", "Muscarine, discovered in 1869, was long thought to be the active hallucinogenic agent in A. muscaria.", "Ectomycorrhizal, Amanita muscaria forms symbiotic relationships with many trees, including pine, spruce, fir, birch, and cedar.\nCommonly seen under introduced trees, A. muscaria is the fungal equivalent of a weed in New Zealand, Tasmania and Victoria, forming new associations with southern beech (Nothofagus).\nThe species is also invading a rainforest in Australia, where it may be displacing the native species.", "At the base is a bulb that bears universal veil remnants in the form of two to four distinct rings or ruffs.\nBetween the basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of the partial veil (which covers the gills during development) in the form of a white ring.\nIt can be quite wide and flaccid with age.\nThere is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness.\nAlthough very distinctive in appearance, the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in the Americas, such as Armillaria cf.\nmellea and the edible Amanita basii \u2014 a Mexican species similar to A. caesarea of Europe.", "Amanita muscaria is a cosmopolitan mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as Hindu Kush, the Mediterranean and also Central America.\nA recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the Siberian \u2013 Beringian region in the Tertiary period, before radiating outwards across Asia, Europe and North America.", "High treason remained distinct though, from what became known as petty treason: the killing of a lawful superior, such as a husband by his wife.\nThough twelfth century contemporary authors made few attempts to differentiate between high treason and petty treason, enhanced punishments may indicate that the latter was treated more seriously than an ordinary felony.\nAs the most egregious offence an individual could commit, viewed as seriously as though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment.\nBut whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned.\nIn his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, \"to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive\", was \"full as terrible to the sensation as the other\".", "Another law enforceable by public burning was De heretico comburendo, introduced in 1401 during the reign of Henry IV.\nIt allowed for the execution of persons of both sexes found guilty of heresy, thought to be \"sacrilegious and dangerous to souls, but also seditious and treasonable.\"\nBishops were empowered to arrest and imprison anyone suspected of offences related to heresy and, once convicted, send them to be burned \"in the presence of the people in a lofty place\".\nAlthough the act was repealed in 1533/34, it was revived over 20 years later at the request of Queen Mary I who, during the Marian persecutions, made frequent use of the punishment it allowed.", "A 2006 molecular
