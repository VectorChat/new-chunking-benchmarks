["While feminist research in this area is to be commended and learned from, it has also contributed to a one-sided depiction of the atrocities of war that tends to consign the male victim to oblivion.\nConsider the evaluation of the Bosnian war by Bogdan Denitch, otherwise one of the most clear-eyed appraisers of Yugoslavia's collapse: It is there [Bosnia] that by far the worst atrocities have taken place.\nNot only have there been vast and well-documented massacres of mostly Muslim civilians by Serbian militias, but concentration camps and massive forcible population transfers, known as \"ethnic cleansing,\" have also been used to change the demographic realities of Bosnia.", "One of the most widely-noted acts of gendercide during the war was the massacre at Izbica in early April.\nThe Christian Science Monitor (1999) related the events in only slightly less distorted a fashion than did the Post in reporting Racak: \"The Monitor tracked down three men who in separate interviews insisted they were among 60 or 70 people who helped to bury the dead.\nOne gave the number of victims as 148, with two survivors; the others spoke of 150, including several women..\" (emphasis added).\nRemarkably, in the entire Monitor story, it was nowhere stated that this \"worst massacre known in Kosovo\" was a truly towering act of gender-selective slaughter.", "In the light of these manifest realities, the \"emptying\" motif seems nothing short of Orwellian- an excellent example of the kind of conceptual vacuum into which Kosovar males fell during the war.\nIV.\nRape Worse Than Death?\nAnother phenomenon in public discussion of the Kosovo war and the Balkans more generally has been the privileging of rape or mass rape of women over the slaughter or mass slaughter of (non-combatant) males.\nThe implicit prioritizing of sexually-assaulted women, often on ambiguous or scanty evidence, reflected both age-old biases and more recent feminist activism on the issue of mass rapes in Bosnia and elsewhere.", "(Denitch, 1994: 124; emphasis added.)\nThe gendering of the massacre victims and concentration-camp inmates was fairly well established by this point (1994), but Denitch reserves the very \"worst\" designation for the mass rapes of women, rather than the \"vast and well-documented massacres of mostly Muslim civilians,\" overwhelmingly males.\n(14) This dubious hierarchizing of human suffering was implicit throughout much of the discussion of the rape controversy during the Kosovo war.\nFor example, James Rubin on 13 April called for Yugoslavia to \"take immediate steps to punish the perpetrators of rape and other crimes..\" (Rubin quoted in Agence France-Presse, 1999c.)", "The article featured several examples of the displacement strategy mentioned above, referring to \"scores of accounts of Yugoslav forces killing small groups of ethnic Albanian civilians\" and the \"'summary, random executions of small groups,'\" although the vast majority of the atrocities specifically mentioned in the article were not at all random- they fit the standard gender-selective pattern.\n(10) But the most astonishing reference in the Post story was to \"the [Yugoslav] government's role in the massacre of dozens of women and children at the Kosovo village of Racak\" in January 1999.", "(18) The contrast with the coverage of women rape victims was striking.\nWe have already seen that on regular occasions the rape of women was privileged over the murder of non-combatant males.\nFurthermore, virtually every news outlet ran at least one story on the subject; second-order and third-order framings, placing the crime against the backdrop of the Balkans war and even the whole history of human conflict, were standard.\nConsider, for example, the following reports: Yugoslav forces use ancient ways to break civilian spirits Throughout history rape has been one of the most common but least documented acts of violence committed during wartime.", "For the most part, the civilian male victims of the slaughter were buried in a slew of other designations- \"Kosovar,\" \"ethnic-Albanian,\" etc.\n-- and their specific vulnerabilities were thereby blurred into the larger backdrop of ethnic conflict.\nNeither The New York Times nor The Washington Post- the two major \"agenda-setting\" newspapers in the United States published a single story or editorial focusing on the phenomenon of gender-selective mass executions.", "The story quoted Henderson as stating: \"To cover up atrocities, the Serbs are using civilians dressed in red to clear up massacres.\nThey are clearing bodies well away from where massacres have occurred.\"\n(Press Association, 1999; emphasis added.)\nAs the Kosovar men buried the dead, so were they largely buried in the policy equation and public discussion.\nThe Press Association report managed to go its entire length with the gender of the chain-ganged gravediggers unmentioned, although the colour of the prisoners' dress was noted twice, and the children, mother, and grandmother among a group of refugee landmine victims (the main focus of the story) were carefully designated.", "This deficit is then contrasted with the attention given to the victimization experiences of \"worthy\" victims, such as women, children, and the elderly.\nFinally, the small handful of responsible and insightful media reports on gender-selective atrocities against Kosovar men is evaluated for the alternative it may offer to \"effacing the male\" from coverage of war and violence.\nI.\nIntroduction The war in Kosovo between March and June 1999, tragic as it was, offered an ideal opportunity to analyze the representation and rhetoric of gender in western mass media.", "The BBC began its report on \"Kosovo 'grave gangs'\" with the claim that \"Kosovo Albanians dressed in red [were] being forced to move dead bodies and dig graves\"- a strange emphasis, given the subsequent acknowledgment that these crimson-clad Kosovars were all \"men and boys.\"\n(BBC Online, 1999a; emphasis added.)\nBy the time the story reached the Press Association, the gender variable had disappeared completely: \"Chilling new evidence has emerged of Serbian attempts to cover up massacres of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\nArmed Forces Minister Doug Henderson said he had received 'disturbing reports' of unarmed civilians dressed in red transporting bodies away from atrocity sites.\"", "(Indeed, the systematic exclusion of one category of victims, and the implicit prioritizing of the minority category, is very similar to colonial discourses in Victorian times.)\nThe trope is particularly misleading when the phenomena described- such as the massacre at Velika Krusa and the campaign of mass killing in Kosovo as a whole- are so disproportionately and methodically slanted against males.\nIn virtually all cases, the phrase \"including women and children\" can be translated as \"including a majority of adult men and a minority of women and children.\"\nBut men remain the \"absent subjects,\" entering the narrative only indirectly and by inference, if at all.", "In the context of the Kosovo conflict, this could mean isolating a pattern of rape of women in the conflict, or a pattern of gender-selective executions of men.\nA third-order gendering extends the analysis beyond the boundaries of the immediate conflict, region, and contemporary time-frame.\nIt usually seeks to make broad generalizations about regional, global, and/or historical trends.\nAgain to use our Kosovo examples, this might involve placing the rape of Kosovar women against the broader backdrop of rape as a tool of war in the Balkans in the 1990s.\nIt might go further still, and examine the sexual assault of women as a feature of warfare across civilizations and throughout history.", "More common were phrases like \"mistreatment,\" \"maltreatment,\" \"beatings,\" \"abuse\"- all of which seems inadequate to capture the sadism of the Serb jailers (akin, perhaps, to describing rape as \"unwanted sexual attention\").\nIt was equally striking that what second-order gendering there was of the prison releases- that is, coverage referring to a pattern of gender-selective detentions and disappearances in Kosovo- suggested that a quandary or \"mystery\" somehow had been solved by the release of the men.", "(Herman and Chomsky, 1988: 39.)\nThe concept of \"worthy\" versus \"unworthy\" victims seems a fertile one in analyzing the treatment of the victims of the gendercidal atrocities in Kosovo, and male victims of violence more generally.\n(5) In this section, I sketch some of the predictable, even ritualized, means by which \"unworthy\" male victims were excluded from the analysis, and \"worthy\" ones notably children and women- privileged.\n(6) The effacing of male victims in mass media is generally accomplished by three interrelated strategies.", "During this period, the sample set turned up only the most fragmentary glimpses of a crisis in Kosovar male ranks.\nPerhaps the most consistently attentive media outlet was the Agence France-Presse, which regularly issued dispatches citing David Scheffer's (and later the U.S. Information Agency's) estimates of 100,000 or more men \"unaccounted for.\"\nAs early as 26 March, the AFP delivered a succinct second-order framing of the \"disturbing reports of mass killings trickl[ing] out of Kosovo.\"", "She referred to \"an appalling picture and a consistent picture\" of the gender-selective atrocities being committed by the Serbs.", "There was precisely one reference to \"men\" in the story: to the \"masked [Serb] men with rifles\" hovering around the facility.\nMales as agents of violence were visible, and gendered; as victims, they were effaced from the discourse.\nPerhaps the most bizarre example of the displacement strategy employed during the war came in mid-April, when the subject of Kosovar men used as forced labourers surfaced in press briefings and subsequent media coverage.", "If the character of \"gendercidal\" strategies is noted, it will tend to be relegated to the later and less prominent reaches of coverage.\nAll of these strategies can be isolated not only in media coverage, but in the humanitarian equation (e.g., the reports of organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International) and in policy statements by national governments, although there is no space to enter into a detailed discussion of these themes in the Kosovo context.\nVery similar patterns reasserted themselves during the slaughter in East Timor (September-October 1999), which followed upon the Kosovo war by a matter of mere months.", "It is my conviction that the strategies are of relevance far beyond the Kosovo case, and indeed beyond the theme of gender and international conflict; they speak to the typical means by which male victims of violence are marginalized or \"effaced\" from the prevailing media and human-rights discourse.\nThe sources consisted of the following: Internet Newsgroups:(3) clari.news.conflict.misc clari.news.crime.war clari.news.refugees clari.news.photos clari.world.organizations.misc (On 19 April 1999, ClariNet created a special newsgroup, clari.hot.a, to collate posts about Kosovo.\nIt proved indispensable.)", "During the war in Bosnia, Serbian forces were accused of systematically raping women as a deliberate tactic of war, a particularly cruel means, human rights investigators said, of terrorizing and demoralizing one's enemy.\nBosnian Serbs were accused of operating \"rape camps\" where Muslim women were held captive and repeatedly assaulted by Serbian soldiers.\n(Rohde, 1999.)\nThe framing of the first excerpt is notable.\nThe experience of women rape victims is placed against a backdrop, not only of the Kosovo war and the wider Balkans conflict, but of humanity's \"ancient ways.\"\n(Note also the headline referring to \"rape as a weapon of war.\")", "Let us now consider the press coverage of Kosovar men according to this framework.\nIt can be said with confidence that only the barest fragments of first- and second-order framings emerged in this coverage.\nOne can see glimmers of comprehension in the occasional references to a pattern of male-selective killing in the Balkans conflict, and the attention paid to the phenomenon of male detentions and disappearances after the release of the inmates from Smrekovnica and Liplje prisons in May 1999 (see below).\nBut the coverage in no way approximated the kind of nuanced historical analysis that imbued treatments of Kosovo's women rape victims.", "Effacing the Male: Gender, Misrepresentation, and Exclusion in the Kosovo War by Adam Jones, Ph.D.\nPublished in Transitions: The Journal of Men's Perspectives, 21: 1-3 (2001).\nABSTRACT The Kosovo war of 1999 offered an excellent opportunity to analyze the representation of gender and violent victimization in the mass media.\nThe present article focuses on the motif of \"gendercide,\" or gender-selective mass killing- in this case, of \"battle-age\" ethnic-Albanian men.\nA broad sample of media commentary is presented to demonstrate that \"unworthy\" male victims tend to be marginalized or ignored entirely in mass-media coverage.", "Even the provision of one or two counter-examples- an editorial here, a column there- would hardly offset the general impression of a conspiracy of low-key mumbles, if not outright silence, on the gendercidal assault against ethnic-Albanian males.\n(19) The release of about two thousand men from Smrekovnica and other Serb detention facilities, in late May 1999, marked the one occasion on which victimized males came to the forefront of the discussion.\nThe result was some solid and nuanced reporting of the men's experiences.\nThis came very late in the game, however, and it was notable how infrequently terms like \"torture\" were applied to the men's experiences.", "The second-order framings in all of the excerpts are powerful and detailed.\nAnd what these brief extracts do not capture is the nuanced and highly-personalized treatment generally given to the individual female victims.\nThe reader cannot help but be drawn into their stories and suffering, and respond with moral outrage, which is presumably the intent.\nIn stark contrast, I have never seen a detailed third-order treatment of the gendercidal killings of males in Kosovo (my own aside), let alone one with a historical scope comparable to the first excerpt.", "But the slaughter of \"battle-age\" non-combatant men is at least as prominent and enduring a \"weapon of war,\" in the Balkans and throughout history, as is the rape of women- and a more brutal and severe one, by any reasonable standard.\nEven second-order framings were exceedingly rare and usually fleeting.\nMy sample of media coverage was broadest and most rigorous between 26 March and 25 April.\nThis month-long period surely encompasses weeks when intimations of humanitarian disaster and \"gendercide\" were widespread, and confronted western governments and organizations, as well as media observers, with critical moral and practical choices.", "The closest the Times came to a meaningful \"second-order\" and \"third-order\" gendering of the slaughter, to my knowledge, was a story by John Kifner, early in Operation Horseshoe: \"What is striking about the refugees is that they are largely women, children and old men.\nThe young men, they say, are either hiding in the mountains or have been separated out by the Serbs and taken away to some unknown fate.\nWhile there is no way to verify independently the accounts of killings.. their similarity suggested that they were credible.\nEarlier Serbian efforts to remove Muslims from parts of Bosnia were accompanied by numerous massacres.\"", "The report issued after the Kosovo war by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was emphatic in pointing to these gender- and age-selective strategies: Young men were the group that was by far the most targeted in the conflict in Kosovo.. Clearly, there were many young men involved in the UCK [Kosovo Liberation Army].. but every young Kosovo Albanian man was suspected of being a terrorist.\nIf apprehended by Serbian forces- VJ [Yugoslav army], police or paramilitary- the young men were at risk, more than any other group of Kosovo society, of grave human rights violations.", "Good as Daniszewski's piece was, though, it again limited itself to the Kosovo context, failing to place the gendercide in regional, let alone global-historical, perspective.\nThis largely exhausted the attempts to conceptualize and report the \"genocidal cull of.. males\" in Kosovo during the critical first month of the slaughter.\nThe New York Times, The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, the BBC, The Guardian- all appear to have published nothing comparable to the tiny smattering of articles sampled above.", "A full sensitivity was evident to both the gender and age variables as they had shaped the atrocities so far.\nSomething of the process and periodicity of slaughter that often occurs in these cases was acknowledged (i.e., with the reference that the destruction of Kosovar civilians could proceed in two phases, the \"threatening\" males first, then the \"women, children and old people\").\nEllsberg understood that enormous numbers of people (tens if not hundreds of thousands) were at mortal risk.", "For another example of this strategy, which is not uncommon, see Moutot, 1999.\nThis article referred to Racak only slightly less misleadingly as an \"attack on a fleeing column of some 40 civilians, old men, women and children.\"\nThe core component, the slaughter of \"battle-age\" males, was invisible in this equation.\nCuriously, a subsequent AFP dispatch (Agence France-Presse, 1999b) noted the death at Racak of \"Ajet Emini.. along with 44 other men.\"", "Thus, at the outside: forty-one adult men executed in cold blood, and three women and one boy also killed, in this massacre of \"dozens of women and children.\"\nThe Post's eagerness to find \"worthy\" victims among the carnage leads to their conjuring by the dozens out of whole cloth.\nNor is this a matter of simple historical accuracy.\nIt amounts to a misrepresentation of the essence of the slaughter at Racak- which was a harbinger of the hundreds, possibly thousands, of individual acts of gendercide against Kosovar males between March and June 1999.\n(11) The point can be buttressed with a further example from Kosovo reporting.", "But this framing was not uppermost in Knickmeyer's mind (note the placement of women, children, and elderly men ahead of the wider gendercidal component).\n13.\nOblivious to the contradiction, Janowski mentions later in the article: \"Women are telling stories of their men being tortured and shot.\nIt's completely out of control.\"\n14.\nIn this light, it is interesting to note that the cover of Denitch's book is an AP photo captioned as follows: \"Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Nov. 10 [1993].", "Guthrie told the allies the Yugoslav army was \"overrated\" and \"bully boys good at killing women, children and old people.\"\n(United Press International, 1999.)\nThe emphasis in the first passage is on the presence and newsworthiness of \"many\" women and children (which is, after all, what one would expect in any demographically-representative population).\nIn the second, the cowardliness of the Serb forces is exemplified by their murder of every element of the civilian population except \"battle-age\" males.", "This depiction of the horrors of Omarska- one of the three concentration camps closed after international protests in late 1992- is a mind-bogglingly casual inversion of the gendered reality.\nHelsinki Watch gave the population of Omarska as 2,000 men and 33 to 38 women.\nIn an article for International Affairs on \"The Crime of Appeasement in Bosnia,\" Ed Vulliamy, who witnessed the release of Omarska's survivors, wrote: Omarska had been a place where a prisoner was forced to bite the testicles off a fellow inmate who, as he died of pain, had a live pigeon stuffed into his mouth to stifle his screams.", "An overriding Serb strategy in the conflict was \"gendercide\" against non-combatant men- the same strategy Serb forces had followed from the outset of Yugoslavia's war of dissolution.\n(1) From the first day of the war in Kosovo (24 March 1999), and indeed long before, the Serbs overwhelmingly targeted \"battle-age\" men for the most severe atrocities, although women, the elderly, and children were also exposed to a wide range of abuses and war crimes, ranging from killings to rape and forced expulsion (Jones, 1994).", "It cited U.S. State Department spokesperson James Rubin's reference to \"ominous indications that men of fighting age were separated from their families,\" as did a number of other sources; but it went further, with a brief third-order reference to the fact that \"Such separations of men from women was [sic] commonplace in massacres carried out during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia between Moslems, Serbs and Croats.\"\n(Agence France-Presse, 1999d.)\nTo be sure, this is not a very extensive or sophisticated third-order framing, and the depiction of gendercide in Bosnia as the result of a \"war.. between Moslems, Serbs and Croats\" rather blurs the primary agents of the slaughter.", "(Loeb and Smith, 1999; emphasis added.\n)(15) For an especially interesting example of the trend, we can turn to an article by Tommaso di Francesco and Giacomo Scotti, published in Le Monde diplomatique at the midpoint of the Kosovo war.\nThe authors wrote that in the \"process of vicious mutual ethnic cleansing\" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, physical and psychological terror stemmed largely from the barbaric treatment inflicted in the prison camps created by both Croats and Serbs- particularly, in the case of the Serbs, the notorious Omarska camp with its raping of women.\n(di Francesco and Scotti, 1999.)", "I am currently developing Mary Anne Warren's concept of \"gendercide,\" defined as gender-selective mass killing, in an inclusive way, as Warren unfortunately does not (Warren, 1985).\nSee Jones (2000) and the materials compiled on the Gendercide Watch website.\n2.\nSee \"Young Men of Fighting Age,\" chapter 15 in Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe- Kosovo Verification Mission, 1999.\nEmphasis added.\n3.", "In a late section of the paper, I also explore some of the more accurate and responsible media coverage of male victimization in the Kosovo conflict.\nAlthough such coverage appeared like rare nuggets, and was swamped by the more distorted and exclusionary variety, it provides important and constructive exceptions to the rule- and hence an indication that alternatives existed to \"effacing the male\" from the media agenda.\nII.\n\"Including Women,\" Excluding Men In their groundbreaking work, Manufacturing Consent, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky devoted a chapter to the subject of \"Worthy and Unworthy Victims\" in media coverage.", "The \"summary executions\" and \"men missing\" references are drawn from Perlez, 1999.", "(Kifner, 1999.)\nThe excerpts came eight paragraphs into the story, and the \"striking\" subject was then dropped.\nCertainly it was never deemed worthy of a story in its own right.\nThe flicker of a higher-order gendering (that is, the isolation of a pattern, and the citing of the Bosnian precedent) was about as faint as could be.\nThe Post, for its part, did publish an editorial, \"Captive in Serbia,\" pointing out that \"Many Kosovars, particularly men, are being held captive,\" and referring to \"the imprisonment of some Kosovo men\" as \"undoubtedly part\" of a \"planned.. destruction of ethnic Albanian Kosovo as a working society.\"", "The first is that males tend to assume the status of \"non-persons\" in analyses and reportage of conflict and genocide.\nMost commonly, they are effaced from the picture.\nIf their presence is noted at all, it is likely to be obliquely, with the gender variable subsumed by others (e.g., race/ethnicity, nationality, abstract \"victim\" status, colour of clothing).\nCampaigns aimed at the gender-selective killing of males will tend to be ignored or underemphasized in media coverage, in favour of a focus on secondary policies that target \"worthy\" victims (e.g., rape and harassment of women, forced expulsions).", "A man puts his hands on the window of a bus to give his wife and son a last farewell in Sarajevo.\nMore than 1,000 people who have endured months of siege piled onto Red Cross buses in Sarajevo and headed in an often-delayed convoy toward safety in Croatia.\nBosnian president Alija Izetbegovic signed an order that all women, boys under 18, and men over 60 could leave.\"\nMeaning: who could not?\n15.\nAmong the other apparently less \"ghastly\" acts of gendercide mentioned briefly in the article are the following: \"As many as several hundred thousand ethnic Albanian men may have been detained or harmed by Yugoslav government security forces in the past three weeks.", "A similar perspective on gender-selective executions of men would seek to place these killings against a regional and global-historical backdrop.\nI take it as a normative and analytical \"given\" that while first-order, second-order, and third-order treatments may be entirely worthy in and of themselves, second-order and third-order framings are necessary if an effective gender analysis is to be mounted.\nThat is to say, the analysis cannot remain stuck at the level of individual cases or conflicts if it is to contribute to a sophisticated understanding of gender.\nIndeed, any conceptualization of \"gender\" is inconceivable without a second- and third-order framing.", "The manifestly most vulnerable demographic is the only one not represented in the formulation- except insofar as the killing of defenseless battle-age men is seen as a legitimate test of the Yugoslav army's power and machismo.\n(9) (As R.J. Rummel put it in a different context, \"One would think that murdering an unarmed man was a heroic act.\"\n[Rummel, 1994: 323.])\nThe analytical befuddlement to which this strategy rapidly leads was exemplified by a 22 April 1999 story in The Washington Post, \"Accounts of Serbian Atrocities Multiplying.\"\nAs the headline suggests, this was one of the Post's major attempts to confront the scale and patterning of the Serb rampage in Kosovo.", "(Dan, 1999.)\nSplashes of blood are still visible on the lower portion of a door at a pizzeria in Suva Reka, where up to 50 people, including women and children, are believed to have been slaughtered.\n(Lynch, 1999.)\nSince starting work on 18 June, the UK forensic team has exhumed over 260 bodies of Kosovar civilians from mass graves, including women and the remains of 21 children..
