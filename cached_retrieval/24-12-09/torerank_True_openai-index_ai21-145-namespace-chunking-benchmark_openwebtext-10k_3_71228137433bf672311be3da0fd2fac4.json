["His belief was shared by Alan Shepard, who was similarly grounded with a debilitating ear condition and worked closely with Slayton.\nMost of the astronauts who were actually sent out to those sites felt the same.\nMission Control believed otherwise.\nKranz, in particular, felt that the astronautsproper role at the remote sites was as observers and assistants.\nFive days before the launch of the first manned Gemini, Astronauts Pete Conrad and Neil Armstrong went out to the remote sites at Carnarvon and Hawaii, respectively.\nOnce Pete Conrad got to Carnarvon, he encountered Dan Hunter, who was in charge of the station.\nBoth were equally strong-willed and it would lead to a showdown that would provide greater clarity of the roles of both Mission Control and the Astronaut Office during the flight.", "Somehow, they kept it to mere words and talked it out until three in the morning.\nThey cut a deal that would work for the short-term.\nHunter would be in charge of the station, and Conrad would be in charge of real-time operations during the mission.\nKranz had the changes Teletyped out to the remote stations in Carnarval and Hawaii.\nHunter didn\u2019t seem to know when to back down and, the day before Gemini 3 was due to launch, gave Kranz a message to relay to Kraft.\n\u201cThis message doesn\u2019t resolve anything.\nI am going to have it framed and hanged on the wall of my bathroom.\u201d Chris Kraft\u2019s patience was gone.", "The trouble started while Kranz and Kraft were still in Florida after Gemini 2.\nDeke Slayton was in town, too, and received word that Conrad and Hunter had gotten into a heated argument over who was in charge.\nHunter had threatened to kick Conrad out of the station for butting into his turf and the hapless station crew sent a message asking for clarification about whose orders they should follow.\nHe went straight to the apartment where Kranz and Kraft were staying.\nThey had fallen asleep, but the banging on the door woke them right up.\nSlayton shouted, \u201cChris, we got a problem!\u201d Kranz threw on some clothes and, by the time he got out there, Kraft and Slayton were about ready to duke it out.\n\u201cDammit, Chris, get your guy under control!\u201d snarled Slayton.", "It saw its first use on August 21, 1965, at the launch of Gemini-Titan 5, an eight-day mission set to beat Russia\u2019s endurance record and put the U.S. in the lead.\nThe crew was Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad.\nCooper had come up with the slogan \u201cEight Days or Bust\u201d for the mission.\nThe public relations department didn\u2019t like that very much and suppressed it until after the mission.\nConrad had recovered nicely from his spat with Hunter before Gemini 3 and Kranz liked his intensity and honesty.\nIt turned out to be a good match for Gemini 5.\nThe oxygen flow to the fuel cells dropped to alarming levels during the first orbit.\nThinking fast, the crew abandoned the planned rendezvous maneuver and powered down equipment.\nKraft could have aborted the mission right then, but decided to give it a few more orbits to troubleshoot and see if the oxygen levels began to level out.\nTo be on the safe side, Kraft had recovery teams redeployed to emergency landing areas.\nThe White Team began to move into place to back up Kraft\u2019s Red Team.", "They were all lessons that would serve them well

spacecraft the Molly Brown.\nNASA Public Relations hated it but the name was all over the newspapers after the Houston Capcom gave them the send-off, \"You\u2019re on your way, Molly Brown!\"\nThe mission was a success.\nAfter Grissom and Young splashed down, Kraft went to Slayton and cut a deal.\nThe astronauts would be in charge of the spacecraft and Mission Control would be in charge of the mission.\nHunter was transferred to the Goddard Space Flight Center and became the Madrid tracking station manager during Apollo.", "\"You have your orders, young man!\"\nIf Kraft had his way, Hunter wasn\u2019t going to have much of a future in Mission Control.\nAt the customary party on the evening before the launch, the tension between Kraft, Kranz and Slayton had spread to the rest of the controllers and the astronauts and there was none of the usual mingling.\nLlewellyn had too much to drink and tried to start a fight with Alan Shepard.\nKranz intervened and got him out of there.\nThe Gemini 3 crew, Gus Grissom and John Young, had been unaware of trouble before the party but it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out that something was up.\nKranz decided that this was no way to run a mission.", "He would acknowledge that she was an extraordinary woman for sticking with him when he was spending so many long, stressful hours in the Mission Control Center.\nIn the meantime, the Atlas suffered two failures that needed to be sorted out before Cooper could go up in the Faith 7.\nThe launch was pushed back again when the Atlas booster failed an inspection on the launch pad.\nThe problems were solved and the booster passed a second inspection.\nThe launch date for the final Mercury flight was set for May 15, 1963.\nCooper\u2019s mission would last for 34 hours and 22 orbits.\nTo cover it, Mercury Control operated in two shifts for the first time.", "Even though everybody in NASA had the same goal of going to the Moon, there were frequent disagreements about how to get there and who was in charge of what.\nMission Control got into a tug-of-war with the astronaut office over who, exactly, was in charge of the remote stations.\nSince Alan Shepard\u2019s flight, it had become traditional to assign astronauts in the role of Capsule Communicator, the one who would have direct contact with the spacecraft in flight, both in Houston and at the remote sites.\nThough Deke Slayton had been forced into a purely administrative role after being grounded, he was still an astronaut at heart and believed that only astronauts could handle the time-sensitive decision making and communications involved in the role.", "The crew went into their first sleep cycle during Kranz\u2019s shift and his team only had to keep track of any funnies.\nHe made notes and everything went smoothly for the next few shift rota", "The aluminum cylinders reminded him of his days as a Marine.\nHe exclaimed to nobody in particular, \u201cI think I am back in the trenches again with my fire control team, surrounded by empty 105 howitzer canisters!\u201d From then on, the Flight Dynamics team was referred to as \u201cThe Trench\u201d and it wasn\u2019t long before

orbit and forecast where it would be hours or days in the future.", "They were minor items and easily resolved, and then Kranz turned his attention to preparing Gemini 4 for drifting flight so the crew could get some sleep.\nDirect contact with the spacecraft would be sporadic as its orbit took it into areas not covered by the tracking network.\nKranz\u2019s team spent most of this quiet time to do a more in-depth analysis of the spacecraft\u2019s systems and orbital trajectory.\nLlewellyn had taken charge of the flight dynamics team.\nHis team made use of a pneumatic tube system for sending messages to other controllers and computer operators.", "Other controllers didn\u2019t like the idea of relying on drugs to get to sleep and did without.\nGemini 4 splashed down on June 27 after a successful mission.\nMarta was happy that her white vest had gone over so well and Kranz had an idea that she could make a more flashy vest he could wear at the end of a mission to signal his team that they had done a good job.\nGemini-Titan 5 Kranz\u2019s team came up with a surprise for him in the form of an American flag he could keep in his office and bring down to Mission Control at

not careful, they\u2019re going to haul you away and then I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d The needling didn\u2019t stop there.\nKranz suddenly found himself the center of the closed-circuit TV cameras and several controllers commented, \u201cNice vest, Flight!\u201d The next day, pictures of Kranz in his spiffy white vest were featured in newspapers across the country.\nThere were a few unresolved items and glitches, informally referred to as \u201cfunnies\u201d, in Kraft\u2019s logbook.", "Kraft recovered enough to cover the actual launch and Kranz stepped back to his original role of insuring that the control teams and data network were ready.\nIt was one of the few unmanned shots covered by reporters in the control room and Kranz thought it was a bit much for an unmanned suborbital shot that had become nearly routine in the Mercury days.\nThere were so many cameras in the room that a fuse blew, plunging them into darkness.\nThis was where blindfold drills came in handy.\nKranz worked by feel and the mission came off reasonably well for the fact that they weren\u2019t really prepared for a power failure in the control center.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston adapted its electrical systems so that wouldn\u2019t happen in the future and camera crews were required to provide their own power when covering future space missions.", "White reacted like a kid told to come in

trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong.\nWe failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked, they must be considered as one spacecraft, one integrated power system, and a single structure.\nThe next thing is that many of us did not trust the Agena.\nBrooks\u2019s team thought it was a great piece of hardware.\nIf we don\u2019t trust a spacecraft, we have to fix it.\nWe were lucky, too damned lucky, and we must never forget this mission\u2019s lessons.", "Kranz made sure the new plans went out to the remote stations and set up backup communications with John Glenn, the capcom on the Coastal Sentry.\nIt may have occurred to the control team that part of the reason Scott Carpenter had landed so far out of the planned recovery area was that he had fired the retros a few seconds late, but that was the biggest concern.\nWhile going over the stowage and pre-retro checklists with the Zanzibar CapCom, Cooper reported, \u201cMy automatic control system inverter has failed.\nI\u2019ll have to make a manual reentry.\u201d Zanzibar asked, \u201cHave you tried the standby inverter?\u201d \u201cRoger.\nIt would not start.\u201d They continued with the checklist, and then Cooper made contact with Coastal Sentry: \u201cOh, my automatic inverter failed along with a few other odds and ends.\nI will shoot the retros on manual and then reenter manually also.\nI\u2019m looking to get a lot of experience on this flight.\u201d", "Rescue personnel found an annoyed Carpenter munching on a candy bar.\nCarpenter was heard to comment, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d That made Llewellyn mad.\n\u201cThat SOB is lucky to be alive.\u201d From then on, whenever someone wanted to get Llewellyn to tell the story, all they had to do was repeat the line, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d Kranz felt that a combination of a distracted crewman, too many scientific experiments, and ground crew taking too long to remind him of checklists had almost cost them an astronaut.\nThey had gotten lucky, but Kranz wanted to eliminate luck as a factor in future space flights.", "A few minutes later, he reported that the booster was moving away from the Gemini in a lower orbit.\nIt was a quick lesson in orbital mechanics.\nBy accelerating toward the Titan, McDivitt had boosted the Gemini into a higher orbit and lost ground speed.\nTo catch the booster, he would have had to drop into a lower orbit and gain ground speed.\nThat was counterintuitive to a pilot used to the idea that he had to accelerate toward the object he wanted to rendezvous with.\nAfter another attempt to rendezvous with the booster, Kraft decided that they should give it up.\nIn the meantime, Ed White was preparing for his EVA.", "During the post-mission debriefing, Kranz got up on the stage and gave a speech about discipline and control.\nThinking back on it years later, Kranz conceded that it was a wonder that more fistfights didn\u2019t break out during the race to the moon.\nReady For EVA?\nWhile celebrating the success of Gemini 3, Kranz heard through the grapevine that the Russians had scored another space first with an EVA by cosmonaut Aleksei Leonov.\nIt seemed like the U.S. couldn\u2019t score a space first for anything and Chris Kraft seemed distracted when Kranz delivered a report on the Gemini 3 mission to his office.", "Problems developed in the thrusters and seat tests and Kraft dived into the task of insuring that the control team was ready for any contingency.\nHe was still the senior flight director and gave Kranz the authority to do the same with his team.\nKranz assured him that he was already on the job.\nThen, Kranz got his first real test in his new role of flight director when Kraft became practically bedridden with influenza six days before the launch.\nThe job of handling the final simulation, pad tests and pre-launch briefings fell on Kranz\u2019s lap.\nThere was a chance that Kranz would have to step into Kraft\u2019s place for the launch and he was so nervous that he clipped out a Sports Illustrated picture of a woman in a swimsuit for emotional support.", "Gemini would make use of fuel cells and cyrogenics, storable propellants, and a rudimentary computer.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center was also being redesigned to make use of computers.\nDigital systems were also being installed at the remote tracking stations and the data network was upgraded to transmit data at 2.4 kilobits per second, which was considered high-speed at the time.\nA new influx of college graduates were brought in to maintain the new technology and bring the control team up to speed.\nKranz had only limited experience with computers and had to scramble to catch up.\nThe residents of Flight Controller Alley spent almost two years preparing for the first Gemini launch and became a close-knit bunch in the process.", "The EVA ground team reviewed footage of Leonov\u2019s spacewalk and inspected hardware being developed for White\u2019s EVA with the goal of having everything ready two weeks before the scheduled launch date.\nIn the meantime, Marta had given birth to their fifth child.\nTheir house in Flight Controller Alley had become too small.\nWith Gene Kranz at work most of the time, she had to prepare for a move to Dickinson, Texas, alone.\nIt was her idea to make him a white vest representing his team\u2019s color that he could wear when leading the White Team during a mission.\nHe agreed to give it a try.", "This would mean exposing the entire interior of the spacecraft to vacuum.\nThere would be nothing between the astronauts and instant death but their thin space suits and helmets.\nThe team decided to give him an extra orbit to get through his checklist.\nNo one knew what to expect.\nDeke Slayton had told McDivitt that if White was having problems outside that could endanger both of them, he should simply close the hatch and come home.\nNobody really expected him to obey.\nDuring the third orbit, Gemini 4 was given the Go to depressurize the spacecraft.", "Glenn\u2019s response was a little sarcastic: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get it.\u201d Glenn gave the countdown for the retrofire.\nCooper made a nearly flawless reentry and, when complimented on a job well done, drawled in his Oklahoman accent, \u201cAw, shucks, we aim to please.\u201d The Gemini Project had the goals of developing many of the techniques and technologies needed to get to the Moon.\nGemini demonstrated extra-vehicular activity (EVA), rendezvous and docking techniques and man\u2019s ability to function in space for mission durations of up to two weeks.\nThe Gemini Twins On the outside, Gemini looked like a bigger version of the Mercury capsules.\nOn the inside, many of the systems had been streamlined.\nThe interior allowed more space for the \u201ctwins,\u201d two astronauts, who would be riding it, but would still be cramped.", "To allow for limited private communications, Mission Control worked out a workaround code called UHF-6.\nIf either the ground or the crew requested a UHF-6 test, a private loop would be set up with a surgeon in the back room and the surgeon would privately brief the flight director afterwards.\nThe press was typically nosy, however, and Kranz tried to give them a runaround with highly technical jargon about communications and antenna.\nThat failed and he was forced to admit defeat.\nWith the Gemini 6 launch coming up, all the controllers were pulling exhausting double shifts.\nLlewellyn got himself into trouble when he went home to sleep.\nWhen he didn\u2019t show for White Team\u2019s next turn in the control room, Kranz had the previous shift\u2019s RETRO give him a call.\nLlewellyn raced to work and, without thinking of the possible consequences, drove his car across the lawn and up the stairs.\nPerhaps he thought he had found the perfect parking place at the building\u2019s main entrance, but security personnel weren\u2019t amused.\nLunney and Hodge had his parking pass suspended and told Kranz, \u201cLlewellyn has got to learn a lesson.\nHaving to walk on site will maybe put a dent in his thick skull.\u201d Kranz doubted it and Llewellyn proved him right when he showed up with his own horse the very next day.", "They were finally going the rest of the way and only Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins had better seats than the people in the control room.\nCharlesworth stayed on duty until after the trans-lunar injection, and then Kranz took over.", "It was questionable whether he could even get into the proper attitude for reentry and he would have to use the fly-by-wire system to keep his spacecraft from tumbling.\nLlewellyn resorted to high school geometry to determine that Carpenter was going to land at least 200 miles long.\nAs Carpenter began coming back into the atmosphere and they lost radio contact, all the people in the control room could do was pray.\nKranz had only felt this kind of helplessness when he held his wife\u2019s hand during childbirth.\nFinally, Grissom caught Carpenter\u2019s report that his chute had deployed and replied that they would get Air Rescue personnel to him within an hour.", "The Apollo Program was America\u2019s final push in the race to the Moon.\nIt would produce nationally and internationally recognized names like Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and many more.\nApollo Chris Kraft had been promoted to chief of the Flight Operations Directorate and gotten so busy with his new duties that he was no longer an active flight director.\nGene Kranz had been promoted to the deputy of the Flight Control Division and decided to only direct the odd-numbered Apollo flights.\nThough he didn\u2019t realize it at the time, this put him directly in line to be a flight director for the first lunar landing.\nNASA returned to unmanned tests of the Saturn V rockets and the new Command, Service and Lunar Modules that made up an Apollo spacecraft.\nApollo 2 and 3 were skipped and Apollo 4 launched successfully on November 9, 1967.\nIt was an \u201call-up\u201d test, checking out all three stages of the Saturn rocket and then hurling the empty command module back toward Earth to test the heat shield.\nIt was the idea of George Mueller, who was in charge of the actual manned spaceflight program, and Gene Kranz would give him a lot of the credit for getting to the moon a lot sooner than they would have otherwise.\nApollo 5 was a test of the Lunar Module.\nThe walls of the LM were so thin that a good poke with a pencil would have punched a hole right through them.\nThey wouldn\u2019t have worked in an atmosphere and were so ungainly-looking that the astronauts called the training version \u201cflying bedsteads.\u201d It was a good chance to try out a few new controllers who had come on board since Gemini.\nKranz would need them.\nThree days before the launch, LM control engineer got into a traffic accident on his way to work.\nWhile he was still able to cover the actual launch, he was unable to move his upper body and could only communicate with the help of fellow controller Bob Carlton.\nThe launch went smoothly, and then they ran into two alarms at once.\nDPS DELTA V indicated that the thrust hadn\u2019t built up fast enough.\nThey would have to reset the timer.\nThe other one was simply labeled, FORGET IT.\nThis meant that the command to throttle up the engine had not been executed.\nThey extended the mission by an orbit to see if they could still accomplish all their goals.\nSending commands went from being a hassle to being a major problem due to poor signal strength.\nThe controllers ended up punching in commands manually.\nKranz did not want to lose the test of the LM\u2019s abort system, so he decided to ditch all the other tests if he absolutely had to and focus on that one.\nThe command was sent up and Kranz heard the welcome news from Carlton: \u201cFire-in-the-hole, abort stage, we are stable!\u201d Their struggles with the commands had done some damage to the LM but they accomplished all the important objectives.\nBecause of their success, newspapers were able to report the happy news: \u201cApollo Mission A Success, Lunar Program On Track!\u201d Apollo 6 was less than successful due to failed rocket engines.\nIn August 1968, Flight Control Division chief John Hodge was abruptly transferred out to study post-Apollo options, leaving Kranz in charge.\nCoupled with an accelerating schedule, he would compare it to \u201cjuggling grenades.\u201d They were about to get rolling with manned flight again, with Wally Schirra in command of Apollo 7.\nIt would turn into a battle of wills.", "Cooper made some celestial observations and took several pictures of Earth and celestial objects during a quiet period in his schedule, and then set a milestone of his own when he became the first American to sleep in orbit.\nHis heart rate dropped low enough to alarm the physicians, who had CapCom wake him briefly to make certain he was okay.\nThe team fell into a mode of relaxed alertness and kept an eye on things until Kraft\u2019s team came back on duty.\nDuring the nineteenth orbit, Cooper\u2019s05 G indicator came on.\nThis would have meant that he had started reentry, but Cooper believed it was a false reading and disabled the fuses leading to it.\nThis disabled an automatic system that would have been used for retrofire.\nCooper would have to fire the retro rockets manually.", "Kranz handed out their flight controllerscertificates himself, and then the first class went out to the remote sites.\nA few of the controllers posted in unfriendly territories like Zanzibar had military experience that served them well when they ran across such obstacles as burning roadblocks and hostile natives.\nSome of the new mission controllers served only one or two missions, decided the responsibility was too much for them, and moved on to other careers.\nOthers didn\u2019t want to relocate from Virginia.\nThose who stayed had a chance to move up the ladder and be reassigned back to the friendlier Houston.\nBy the end of the Mercury Project, there were only 50 controllers left in Florida.\nHouston proved to be a friendly host city, even naming their baseball team the \u201cAstros\u201d in honor of the astronauts.", "October 25, 1965 looked like a beautiful morning for the planned double launch.\nThe Agena would go up first to set up the conditions of the rendezvous.\nWally Schirra and Tom Stafford waited in their Gemini for the second launch.\nThe Agena launch went smoothly.\nThe Atlas booster separated from the automated spacecraft on schedule and the Agena lit its engine.\nThen, the data on FIDO\u2019s console stopped updating.\nThey had lost contact with the Agena.\nThe Gemini 6 countdown continued until Range Safety reported debris falling into the ocean.\nWhen it became obvious that the Agena had exploded, Kranz\u2019s team decided that there was no point in launching the Gemini and called it a day.\nThat evening\u2019s Judo match gave both Kranz and Llewellyn a chance to vent their frustrations, and then they retreated to the Singing Wheel.\nThis was the controllersfavorite bar, where they celebrated successes and mourned losses.\nFor a little while, it looked like Gemini 6 wasn\u2019t going to happen.\nThen, somebody had an inspired idea.\nGemini 7 was going to go up before too long.\nWhy not make it the target vehicle for the Gemini 6 rendezvous?\nThough neither side in the Space Race had mastered rendezvous yet, the Russians had already demonstrated their capacity for running two missions at once.\nCould the Americans do the same?\nThey were certainly going to find out and Gemini 6 and 7 came to be known collectively as Gemini 7/6.\nGemini 7/6", "As Aurora 7 went into the final orbit, it became obvious that Carpenter would have to make a manual reentry.\nThe Capcom at the Hawaiian station talked him through the checklist for retrofire.\nIn the meantime, he was still having trouble with the temperature on his pressure suit and, by the end of his third orbit, was starting to show signs of overheating.\nAt one point, Chris Kraft snapped to Gus Grissom at CapCom, \u201cDammit, Gus, keep him on task.\nI think he\u2019s delirious.\u201d Though California gave him the countdown for firing the retro-rockets, Carpenter hit the button three seconds too late.\nHe was going to land somewhere past the planned landing area.", "When Kranz finished giving a verbal summary, Kraft walked across his office and closed the door.\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re ready as a flight director for Gemini 4 because there\u2019s a job I want you to do for me.\u201d Gemini 4 was already a packed four-day mission and NASA chiefs had decided to add an EVA by Ed White.\nKraft wanted Kranz to work with the Crew Systems Division on planned altitude chamber tests and put together the mission rules and data packet for America\u2019s first spacewalk.\nKraft was pacing.\n\u201cThis is risky, but I think it\u2019s worth a shot at getting a spacewalk on [Gemini 4 mission commander] McDivitt\u2019s mission.\u201d", "Simulation Supervisor Mel Brooks took charge of training and ran the flight controllers through their paces.\nSimulated missions were one thing the mission controllers had in common with the astronauts.\nBrooks would throw every imaginable scenario at them to see how they handled it.\nOne time, the simulation supervisor (SimSup) decided Kraft was depending too much on Kranz and pulled him off.\n\u201cKranz had an accident on the way to MCC and is in the hospital,\u201d SimSup told Kraft.\nKranz protested, \u201cWhat are you doing?\nWe have a mission to prepare for!\u201d Kraft was amused.\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been benched.\u201d Von Ehrenfried filled in as assistant flight director and did fine.", "Just before Cooper\u2019s flight, he got a local hospital to provide an electrocardiogram of somebody having a heart attack, fed it into the simulation, and stood back and laughed up his sleeve while the physicians tried to figure it out.\nThat taught the physicians that an astronaut might not have time for doctors to argue over the diagnosis.\nBrooks became notorious for his challenging simulations.\nKranz\u2019s family was still growing.\nMarta gave birth to their fourth child, a boy, and the residents of Flight Controller Alley ganged up on Kranz to send him to her side while she was in labor.", "The plan also included observations of the spectacular sunsets and sunrises that John Glenn has reported, as well as Earth and space.\nKranz was promoted to assistant flight director, second only to Chris Kraft in the control room.\nOther changes to the control room personnel included the addition of Llewellyn at the Retro console, responsible for monitoring the firing of the retro rockets just before reentry.\nLlewellyn would be replacing Carl \u201cDancing Bear\u201d Huss, who was being moved to the Mission Analysis branch to take charge of designing lunar trajectories for what would become the Apollo Program.\nThe launch went off on May 24, 1962 at 7:45:16 EST.", "This was critical for planning maneuvers like rendezvous and Gemini 4 was their first real test of their ability to keep track of variables like atmospheric drag.\nKranz\u2019s first shift in Mission Control passed uneventfully and he handed the logbook to John Hodge.\nHe hung his white vest on a hook, his thoughts racing ahead to the news conference he now had to face.\nThough NASA\u2019s public-relations officers were not universally popular and often hated by the astronauts, Gene Kranz thought they really earned their pay when dealing with the press conferences.", "Mission Control and the remote sites used timed-tagged stored program commands (SPC) to control the unmanned Agena.\nBecause the Agena spacecraft had given them so many problems, nobody was taking any chances that it might misinterpret a command and go wild.\nThe Agena had an error checking routine that helped controllers verify that the command being put in the onboard computer\u2019s memory was the one they had sent.\nAs a backup, the remote site computers performed an echo check by automatically recording each command as it was converted into radio waves and checking it with the intended command load.\nIf the telemetry from the Agena\u2019s error checking routine failed, controllers could perform a manual check that would take several hours or save time by basing their decisions on the echo check.\nGemini 8 was only half an orbit from rendezvousing with the Agena when the CapCom on Rose Knot reported that they had lost the automatic data comparison on the Agena.\nThe Agena systems engineer tried to rerun it, and then began printing out the memory data for the manual check.\nThe echo check looked okay, so Gemini 8 approached the Agena as planned, Rose Knot gave everything one last check, and the controllers gave the Go for docking.\nThe Americans scored their second space first when Armstrong reported, \u201cWe\u2019re docked, no noticeable oscillations, very smooth.\u201d Everything seemed to be going well, though CapCom Jim Lovell decided that Armstrong and Scott should be informed of the failed load comparison.\nA military coup in Zanzibar had forced NASA to move the remote station over to Madagascar and Gemini 8 was making a pass over it when Lovell told them, \u201cIf the Agena attitude control system goes wild, just send the command to turn it off and take control of the spacecraft.\u201d", "In any case, Carpenter would go on to participate in Sealab and never flew a space mission again.\nWally Schirra\u2019s six-orbit Sigma 7 flight was a success, with Capcom Deke Slayton providing a little comedic relief when he asked Schirra, \u201cHey Wally, are you a turtle?\u201d Schirra recorded his reply, \u201cYou bet your sweet ass I am!\u201d and then came back on the radio with a simple, \u201cRog.\u201d Mercury was winding up for a grand finale with Gordon Cooper\u2019s day-long flight.\nBob Gilruth became director of the Manned Flight Center and began reassigning people to make preparations for Gemini and Apollo.", "The official investigation would reveal that the fire had started somewhere near Gus Grissom\u2019s seat.\nThere was some speculation that Grissom could have done something to cause the fire, which the controllers and engineers who were most involved in the project thought was pure nonsense.\nThe fire had started in an area that Grissom couldn\u2019t reach from his seat, even by accident.\nThe Apollo spacecraft went through a redesign process that included a hatch that could be opened in seconds, a reduction in combustible materials in the spacecraft, a change in the cabin\u2019s atmosphere from pure oxygen to a hydrogen-oxygen mix, and insulated wires that couldn\u2019t cause sparks.\nThough the blame was never pegged on any one person, some of the controllers quit and others suffered breakdowns and were transferred out of Mission Control.\nThose who remained set their minds to picking up the pieces and swore that they would do whatever it took to honor the Apollo 1 crew\u2019s sacrifice and reach the Moon by the end of the decade.", "By the third day, Schirra\u2019s bad temper was obvious enough for newspapers to comment, \u201cCaptain Awakes Grumpy.\u201d He curtly vetoed the TV show, leaving an embarrassed PR staff to explain that one to the press.\nHe backed down after the fifth day and the crew tried to make up for it by continuing the tradition of Schirra\u2019s humorous signs.\nKraft and Slayton broached the subject of keeping their helmets on during reentry and Schirra blew up.\nAs he later put it in a Sudafed commercial, \u201cHave you ever tried sneezing in one of these?\u201d On the one hand, keeping the helmets on would protect them if the cabin depressurized suddenly.\nOn the other, they still had the colds and risked ear blockage and possible hearing loss if they kept the helmets on.\nIt took some doing, but the flight directors did their best to keep their cool with the crew and keep their flight teams on track.\nEven so, it took its toll and Lunney vented his frustration to Kranz during the last handover, \u201cI have finally had enough of this crew.\u201d Schirra got his way on the helmet issue and his crew made it down on schedule.\nIt was Schirra\u2019s third and last space flight and Eisele and Cunningham never flew in space again.\nLunney received a well-deserved medal for his efforts.\nKranz never found out why Schirra had been so bad-tempered and, after leaving NASA, Schirra went back to his normal funny self.", "The first orbit looked good, with Scott Carpenter reporting that the temperature in his pressure suit was a little high.\nEverything else was nominal, the ground controllers at each remote station were on the ball, and Carpenter made the planned external observations.\nThe fireflies, a mystery during John Glenn\u2019s flight, were reported by Carpenter as \u201ccapsule emanating,\u201d droplets of water being shed by the skin of his own capsule.\nThen, things began to go downhill.\nDuring the second orbit, Scott Carpenter reported a disagreement between the attitude readouts and what he was seeing out the window.\nThe people on the ground concurred and recommended resetting the gyros.\nThis didn\u2019t help, and Carpenter ended up wasting a lot of fuel trying to correct until they suggested that he simply coast until he was ready to start the reentry sequence.", "Gemini-Titan 4 This would be the first mission featuring three shifts in Mission Control.\nJohn Hodge\u2019s Blue Team manned the control center until the crew woke up, and then Chris Kraft\u2019s Red Team took over and went through a nearly flawless countdown.\nThey had only one pause to fix a glitch in the erector holding the rocket in a vertical position.\nGemini 4 launched at 10:15:59 am on June 3, 1965.\nWhen the Titan burned itself out, McDivitt separated the Gemini from the Titan booster on schedule.\nHe turned the Gemini around and accelerated toward the spent booster.", "While the air in the spacecraft was gradually reduced, McDivitt and White performed final checks on their spacesuits.\nAn inflated pressure suit was like a balloon with a man inside and White had difficulties getting through the hatch.\nHe made it, though, and cavorted around the Gemini with only a thruster gun to manuever.\nHe was obviously having a good time as he made observations on the Earth and space.\nTwenty minutes sped by fast and both the ground team and McDivitt prompted him to begin thinking about getting back into the spacecraft.\nMcDivitt told him, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get back in here before it gets dark.\u201d", "This press conference did cause one lingering misconception about Kranz.\nThe blurbs about the flight directors in the press release said he looked like a poster boy for the Marines.\nThe press ate that one up and, from then on, Kranz felt like he was forever explaining that he was Air Force, not Marines.\nHe found a place at MCC to sleep until the end of the mission.\nIf he needed an assist to wind down, he could go to the doctors for a double shot of whiskey to put in his coffee.\nHe found out fast that whiskey and coffee were not a good combination.", "A few people were hesitant about his Oklahoman accent, which made him sound like a back-waters country boy, and he nearly got yanked from the mission when he rattled nerves by buzzing the control center in a T-38.\nThe launch went off as planned at 8:04 AM EST.\nThings went smoothly at first, with Cooper ticking off his experiments on schedule and the shift change occurring on schedule as Faith 7 was progressing along its sixth orbit.\nHodge had a different approach to mission control than Kraft did.\nKraft was a very hands-on mentor of the young mission controllers and comfortable with his status as team leader.\nHodge tried to obtain a consensus before making a decision, was good with people but didn\u2019t seem quite so comfortable with his leadership role.\nKranz remembered him as a nice guy.", "At first, Kranz thought Slayton had been pulled off the flight because he complained too much about the experiments he was supposed to perform on the flight.\nWhen he found out the truth, he chalked it up to the fact that if you asked enough experts, you would eventually find one nay-sayer.\nSlayton took charge of the astronaut corps, an important job that must have felt like a consolation prize.\nCarpenter swung right into preparations and named his spacecraft the Aurora 7.\nThe flight date was changed to give him more time for training.\nThe Friendship 7 had proven the value of having a man in control of the spacecraft and they hoped to expand on it with Aurora 7.", "One of Kranz\u2019s contribution was a mock-up of a Gemini cockpit.\nHe wanted his team to become nearly as familiar with the spacecraft\u2019s controls as the astronauts would be.\nThey would hold blindfold drills in which they reached for each switch until they could almost have flown the thing themselves.\nThe art of flight control was continuing to be refined and the control team spent many hours studying schematics and writing flight procedures and mission rules.\nKraft made one change in the job description of the flight director.\nThe description now said: \u201cThe flight director may, after analysis of a flight, take any action necessary for mission success.\u201d This cleared up some vague terms in the previous job description and gave the flight director more leeway in directing the missions.", "Whenever Gemini 7 flew into gaps in ground coverage, Kranz drilled his team in the fine art of handling two flights at once.\nIt was a nightmare for the CapComs and the computer people, who had to learn how to switch between the programs for each mission in an instant.\nOne little glitch could bring the computer system down.\nEarly in the morning of December 12, 1965, Kranz\u2019s team was exhausted but ready when they handed things over to Hodge\u2019s Blue Team.\nSomebody had cancelled the post-shift press conference, leaving him free to return to his quarters at MCC.\nAs a result, he missed seeing how steady astronauts could be when things went wrong but heard all about it later.", "Cliff Charlesworth\u2019s Green Team got the crew on their way at 7:51 EST on December 21.\nLike many of the Gemini controllers had been, some of the members of his team were fresh out of college and Llewellyn couldn\u2019t resist playing a joke on one of them.\nOne of the youngsters asked about a controller who had visited the coffee station ahead of them.\nLlewellyn retorted, \u201cSheeet, man, that\u2019s Captain Refsmmat, the ideal flight controller!\u201d Refsmmat was Trench shorthand for \u201creference to stable member matrix.\u201d The rookie controller fell for it and \u201cCaptain Refsmmat\u201d became the mascot for the Trench.\nPretty soon, pictures of Refsmmat were hanging in strategic locations around Mission Control and scribbled on by appreciative members of the team who saw it as a safe place to express their thoughts.\nCaptain Refsmmat stuck around for the rest of Apollo and Skylab.", "For all the problems that the Mercury and Gemini missions had thrown at them, NASA hadn\u2019t yet lost astronauts during a mission.\nNASA personnel were starting to get overconfident and NASA senior staff had decided to go with a new contractor called North American Aviation to build the Apollo spacecraft.\nChris Kraft was already on the project and trying to straighten out the way it was being mismanaged by arrogant NAA employees.\nIt wasn\u2019t going well.\nThe NAA fought them on issues like releasing technical details of the spacecraft and assigning representatives to the control center to help with preparations.\nThey even got into the ongoing debate about the route they would take to the moon.\nOne favorite route was called Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR), in which astronauts would rendezvous with a spacecraft already in orbit and land that spacecraft on the moon.\nAnother route was an underdog called Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR), in which a crew of three astronauts would go into lunar orbit, and then two of them would undock in a smaller spacecraft and land it on the moon.\nNAA took the EOR side, which would give them full control of manufacturing the spacecraft.\nNorth American turned out a spacecraft that was so riddled with problems that Gus Grissom hung a lemon on it.\nPerhaps someone should have taken the hint.\nThe \u201cplugs-out\u201d test scheduled for January 27, 1967, was considered to be low-risk.\nThe crew were in their pressure suits, in a one hundred percent oxygen atmosphere, and locked in with a newly redesigned hatch that would not blow off by accident.\nThe crew were Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom, Gemini 4 Spacewalker Ed White and a rookie astronaut named Roger Chaffee.\nAt 1:00 pm, they were sealed into the spacecraft.\nKranz volunteered to lead the MCC team participating in this test and was in his office before sunrise.\nThe Apollo program director had been complaining about the MCC\u2019s readiness and especially their computer systems, so Kraft sent a memo to Kranz telling him to get his systems people to quit their \u201cgold-plating\u201d and justify their requirements.\nKranz sent back a quick acknowledgement and went to get the MCC ready.\nControllers started to arrive for the test at about 11:00 a.m.\nThey were all sick of the amount of testing by this point and John Hodge griped to Kranz, \u201cI sure hope things go well today.\nWe need to get going on our own work.\u201d Kranz just handed over the logbook, went down to his office to get a little work done, and then knocked off early to beat the rush hour traffic.\nThe crew received their \u201cgo\u201d to enter the capsule.\nGrissom plugged his suit into the oxygen supply and immediately reported a sour smell.", "Kranz had recently been offered a chance to return to test flight and would likely have done so if they had gone ahead with the plan to release the shroud.\nHe had dodged a bullet.\nCernan went on to make the planned EVA.\nEven without going over to the Agena, it was a surprisingly tough job and he wore himself out just getting to the backpack stowed in a compartment outside the Gemini.\nHe was drenched with sweat and the evaporation fogged up his visor, blinding him.\nNASA physician Chuck Berry recommended rest breaks that didn\u2019t help much.\nCernan didn\u2019t need any prodding to give it up.\nWhite\u2019s easy EVA during Gemini 4 had fooled them all.\nEVA was harder than it looked and it was added to their list of problems to solve before the first moon landing.\nThe problem was in the way the astronauts were being trained and the rocketmeisters in Huntsville, Alabama, solved it with a water tank where astronauts could practice EVA activity.\nGemini 9 came home safely and Gene Kranz moved over to Apollo.\nHe missed being a flight director for Gemini 10, 11 and 12 but had plenty of work to do.\nHe found a program full with problems.\nApollo 1", "Making the job even more difficult, Ed White knew about the possible EVA before most of Mission Control did.\nKranz would have preferred the chance to brief remote site teams before the flight but was told, \u201cNo briefings.\u201d The remote site CapComs were given sealed envelopes that would only be opened if given specific instructions from Kranz.\nThey contained only a brief note addressing the EVA, plus a planned rendezvous with the booster after separation.\nKranz prepared for his Gemini 4 flight director duties during the day and worked on the EVA at night.", "Launch!\nGemini 6 had given them so many problems that it was almost a letdown when it finally launched without a hiccup on December 15, 1965.\nThe rendezvous maneuvers went smoothly and Gemini 6 caught up with Gemini 7 six hours after launch.\nWhen the White Team took over the control room, they had little time to celebrate but the 6 crew certainly found time for a few jokes.\nWally Schirra had brought along signs that read, \u201cDeke Slayton, are you a turtle?\u201d and \u201cBeat Army.\u201d Deke Slayton at the Capcom position recorded his answer and Gemini 7 shot back, \u201cOh, Wally has a sign.\nIt says \u2018Beat Navy.\u2019\u201d Since it was the Christmas season, Gemini 6 couldn\u2019t resist reporting a UFO apparently originating at the North Pole.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a large module being pulled by eight smaller modules, moving rapidly from north to south.\nThere\u2019s a man in a red suit inside.\u201d Wally Schirra played \u201cJingle Bells\u201d on a harmonica with Tom Stafford accompanying him with a string of bells to the sniggers in Mission Control.\nOf course, the \u201cUFO\u201d would be driven by Santa Claus.\nGemini 6 was a success and came home the next day.\nAt the press conference, the reporters played a gotcha on Gene Kranz by bringing along a bottle of what they claimed was champagne for a toast.\nIt turned out to be Canada Dry ginger ale.", "With John Hodge moving over to Apollo, Gene Kranz was the only one of the original three flight directors left in Gemini.\nGlynn Lunney and Cliff Charlesworth were promoted to fill the role.\nLunney was the youngest flight director and earned a reputation as one of the smartest.\nKranz thought of him as his main competitor.\nCharlesworth had a background in Army ordnance labs and earned the nickname \u201cThe Mississipi Gambler\u201d for his laid-back personality.\nBoth had been part of the trajectory team.\nThey had only two months to prepare for Gemini 9 and Kranz was forced to make an unpopular move.\nHe declared that there would be no holidays or vacations.\nSome of the controllerswives were quite annoyed and let him know about it.\nHe stuck to his guns and explained that astronautslives were on the line every time they sat on top of one of those rockets.\nDuring a launch, controllers had to be capable of making split-second decisions.\nWhenever a controller made a mistake in simulations, the worst that would happen was that he would get teased about it at the end of the day.\nIf it happened during a mission, the astronauts might not make it home.\nThe crew for Gemini 9 was Gene Cernan and Tom Stafford.\nCernan was one of the few early astronauts who had served a role other than CapCom in Mission Control.\nHe had been a booster tank monitor for the first four Gemini missions and the controllers easily accepted him into their ranks.\nHe did most of the talking for the 9 crew.\nStafford was the quiet one of the two and generally kept his opinions to himself.\nTheir first launch attempt on May 17, 1966 was a bust when the curse of the Agena struck again and pieces of it fell into the Atlantic Ocean.\nSo they pulled out a new backup rendezvous vehicle called the augmented target docking adopter (ATDA), the mission was renamed Gemini 9A for the sake of bureaucracy and they scheduled the next launch attempt for June 1.\nThe ATDA launch went well but the controller for this new automated spacecraft reported that it was guzzling fuel and the adapter shroud might not have opened fully.\nA command shut down the ATDA\u2019s attitude control jets.\nIf the shroud hadn\u2019t opened fully, they might not be able to dock but that was a secondary objective.\nA failure in the ground support equipment forced them to scrub the Gemini launch for two days.\nMarta made a special vest with gold and silver brocade over the familiar white for the next launch attempt.\nIt made an impression on visitors on June 3 and Kraft even made a few kidding comments.\nIt may have been a good luck charm.\nEither way, the launch was successful that day.\nThe crew rendezvoused with the ATDA on the third orbit and confirmed Mission Control\u2019s suspicions about the shroud.\nIt was only partly open and held in place by a band.\n\u201cIt looks like an angry alligator,\u201d reported Stafford.\nMission Control sent several rapid maneuver commands in an attempt to jettison the shroud with no luck.\nIn the meantime, the Gemini left the Agena, orbited Earth one more time, and returned for a second rendezvous.\nA brainstorming session by the ATDA team failed to come up with any workable ideas.\nStafford suggested using the nose of the Gemini to nudge the shroud off and Kranz was quick to veto that idea.\nFor the time being, Kranz\u2019s team gave up on trying to get the shroud off.\nKranz went home for supper and to get some fresh clothes to bring back to MCC quarters.\nWhen he got back, he found out that somebody had come up with an idea of doing an EVA to release the shroud and went down to the ready room to see what he could find out.\nSome of NASA\u2019s top staffers were there.\nKranz considered the plan too risky and had his suspicions about who was behind it.\nBuzz Aldrin was one of the more loudly opinionated astronauts and had picked up the nickname of \u201cDr.\nRendezvous\u201d for his attempts to assist with rendezvous planning.\nHe was in the middle of explaining how the EVA might be done.\nKranz explained to the top players in the room that there was a lot of energy stored up in the shroud\u2019s release mechanism and Cernan would have nothing to latch onto while he worked.\nNewtonian physics applied while in orbit and just using a screwdriver could send him spinning if he had nothing to hold onto.\nIf that thing came off with Cernan nearby, they stood a chance of losing one astronaut.\nNASA didn\u2019t need that kind of poor publicity.\nHe was overridden and, even worse, Chris Kraft had done nothing to back him up.\nFurious, Kranz threatened to quit after the mission was over.\nKraft shrugged it off and ordered him to get the job done.\nHowever, Kranz still had one trump card.\nNo one could override a flight director when he was directing a mission in real time.\nIf it seemed like Cernan was having any kind of trouble, Kranz would wave him off.\nEven so, he spent a sleepless night going over possibilities.\nThe safest approach seemed to be taking some medical scissors to the lanyard.\nGemini 9 was just completing the third planned rendezvous when the White Team came back on duty.\nThe crew ended up saving Kranz from having to make a choice.\nThey were already exhausted and getting low on fuel.\nThey wanted to save the EVA for the next day.\nConsidering the circumstances, this was the equivalent of canceling it altogether.\nCapCom looked to Kranz for direction and a relieved Kranz gave him a thumbs-up.\n\u201cFlight concurs.\u201d", "The second suborbital, Liberty Bell 7 manned by Gus Grissom, was nearly a carbon copy of Freedom 7, though the capsule sank and Grissom nearly drowned.\nThe helicopter crews seemed more worried about retrieving the capsule than rescuing Grissom.\nKranz growled to his console, \u201cForget the capsule, just get Gus.\u201d Grissom barely made it out of there by grabbing a line from one of the helicopters.\nThen, the Russians forced NASA\u2019s hand with another space spectacular.\nThe next manned flight would be an orbital one.\nMercury-Atlas 5 was a successful orbital test featuring a chimp named Enos.\nBy now, the astronauts were sick of the sight of chimps and the cadre of monkeynauts were retired after Enosflight.\nMercury-Atlas 6, named Friendship 7 by John Glenn, was originally slated for December 19, 1961.\nThe Mission Control Center was beginning to relocate to Houston and, when the first delay came through, Kranz was just as happy to have the extra time to move his wife and three daughters across the country.\nThe launch was set for January 27, 1962 and then scrubbed again due to a faulty tank bulkhead.\nThe next date was February 14, and they were forced to scrub one more time due to weather.\nJohn Glenn was actually the coolest of the lot by this point, losing his temper only once when somebody suggested that he could get kicked off his flight for supporting his wife when she didn\u2019t want to see the Vice President.\nFinally, they settled for February 20, 1962 for a launch date.\nKranz had watched enough Atlas rockets blow up to acknowledge that they were gambling with a man\u2019s life this morning.\nSomebody broke one of the hatch bolts while John Glenn was being inserted into the spacecraft.\nLuckily, they had spares on hand and they were able to replace it with only a minor delay.\nWalt Williams kept one eye on the weather while they waited.\nWhen the hold was over, Williams started the poll of the controllers, spacecraft and test conductors.\nWith each \u201cGo,\u201d the room became more electrified.\nScott Carpenter called from the blockhouse, \u201cGodspeed, John Glenn!\nThree seconds, two, one, zero!\u201d As the Friendship 7 lifted off, Kranz jotted down some notes that included the time of liftoff in Greenwich time (14:14:39Z) and headed over to the Teletype machine to have the information sent to Bermuda.\nAlan Shepard, in the CapCom position, relayed the \u201cGo\u201d for seven orbits.\nThough the flight plan only called for three, the extra orbits would give them some extra time if they couldn\u2019t bring Friendship 7 down as planned.\nThe signal from the spacecraft was relayed from Cape Canaveral to the station in Bermuda, and then on to the Canary Islands.\nAn ex-Marine named Llewellyn was in charge at Canary Islands and stammered a bit as he asked Glenn for the spacecraft status.\nAs Glenn rattled off readings, Kranz couldn\u2019t resist smiling.\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one who was nervous.\nBut there was an overtone of victory, as well, and he resisted the urge to yell, \u201cWe\u2019ve got an American in orbit!\u201d NASA had really come a long way since \u201cThe Four Inch Flight.\u201d", "Being an observer was rough on Kranz and he spent a lot of time roaming the halls of Mission Control, plugging his headset in where he could.\nIt was a big relief when the TLI burn that would send Apollo 8 out of Earth orbit and on a path to the Moon came off successfully.\nThree days later, Apollo 8 would be swinging around to the far side of the moon for the first time.\nThe control room was almost completely silent except for the voice of CapCom Gerry Carr, \u201cYou\u2019re Go for lunar orbit insertion.\u201d No one on Earth would know if the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) engine burn was successful until Apollo 8 emerged from the radio blackout that came with being on the far side of the moon.\nCarr told the crew, \u201cApollo 8, you\u2019re looking good.\n\u2026 Ten seconds to loss of signal.\u201d Jim Lovell answered, \u201cSee you on the other side.\u201d They heard a burst of static.\nNow came a tense half hour of waiting.\nThe time for the LOI came and went and the controllers took the opportunity for a break.\nCharlesworth the \u201cMississippi Gambler\u201d wasn\u2019t as laid back as normal and went out for a couple of cigarettes.\nThere was nothing any of them could do but watch the clock and hope to reacquire the signal on schedule.\nThe minutes dragged on until the clock reached zero.\n\u201cFlight, we\u2019ve had telemetry reacquisition.\u201d A relieved control team let out a few cheers and went back to reviewing the data.\nApollo 8 was in the planned orbit just sixty miles above the surface.\nThe crew described craters that they named in honor of space luminaries like Gilruth, Kraft, Slayton and Low and also honored fallen astronauts Grissom, White, Chaffee, Ted Freeman, Elliot See, C. C. Williams and Charlie Bassett.\nThey took numerous pictures, including this iconic image of the Earth rising over the moon.\nThe crew had been working for almost a full day by this point and Borman decided that the crew should get some rest before the trans-Earth injection burn that would put them on course for the return to Earth.", "Some people at the Cape weren\u2019t too thrilled with the idea of a dual mission, mostly because it added quite a bit of complexity to their normal work.\nMSC chief Robert Gilruth was a quick convert and a review by Kranz\u2019s team revealed no problems that they couldn\u2019t solve or work around.\nThe Gemini 7 crew, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, welcomed the idea.\nThey were up for a two-week mission in a spacecraft that wasn\u2019t very big and the rendezvous would give them a break in the monotony.\nThe plan was to launch Gemini 7 and promptly swing into action to prepare the same pad for the launch of Gemini 6.\nThe pad and the surrounding area would be checked for debris.\nThe pad would be checked for damage, and then the Titan with the Gemini 6 spacecraft on top would be brought out to the pad and inspected.\nIf everything went smoothly, Gemini 6 would launch one week after Gemini 7.\nMission deployment began on November 21 and SimSup began running the controllers through their paces.\nFor all his inventive simulations, there was one \u201cgotcha\u201d that he wasn\u2019t responsible for.\nSomebody got the idea that the man in charge of Hawaii, named Ed Fendell, could fake a heart attack during training.\nThe goal was to see if the backup team were capable of jumping in if something happened to him.\nDuring the final dress rehearsal for network simulation, Fendell crumpled in a heap as planned.\nIt was such a convincing act that the rest of the Hawaii team were momentarily distracted.\nBucholz plugged into the voice loop to Houston.\n\u201cChris, Fendell just had a heart attack!\u201d", "Llewellyn came into Mission Control to start his shift and FIDO pretended to be so focused on his job that he didn\u2019t even respond to Llewellyn\u2019s greeting.\nSo he asked RETRO what was going on and RETRO answered, \u201cIt\u2019s this dad-blamed test from Sealab.\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Llewellyn got curious and asked Kranz.\nKranz had a hard time keeping a straight face as he explained, \u201cWe have orders to patch communications through to Sealab so Carpenter can give the countdown for the retrofire.\nI argued with Kraft about it but he says, \u2018Do it!\n'}\u201d Llewellyn was furious and inadvertently pulled Dave Scott into the gotcha by telling him all about the fictional test.\nScott blew up and threatened to quit the program if this was the kind of crazy decision he could expect during a mission.\nKranz let them both dangle for a few more minutes before explaining that it was all a joke.\nKranz had taken up Judo at Llewellyn\u2019s invitation and realized that the evening\u2019s match was going to be an especially rough one.\nGemini 5 splashed down with a duration record under their belts and Mission Control began to look ahead to their first attempt at rendezvous and docking.\nThe planned star of the show was an automated spacecraft called Agena.\nSome of the MCC controllers were less than impressed, especially after one ground test in which faulty software sent every available command to the Agena.\nIf this had happened during an actual mission, they would have been in big trouble.\nTheir disparaging comments would turn out to be accurate.\nGemini 6", "Hodge paused the countdown for air sampling and the countdown resumed at 1:25 p.m. Chris Kraft had planned to head up his Red Team for the launch and went down to the MCC for the planned handover.\nHodge decided to hang around in case the test dragged on as it had for some of the plugs-in work.\nSome intermittent communications problem gave Kraft\u2019s team headaches and caused Grissom to growl, \u201cHow can we get to the moon if we can\u2019t even talk between two buildings?\u201d They could have called it a day, but decided to give it another hour.\nThen, shouts from the cockpit sent chills down everybody\u2019s spine.\n\u201cFire!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fire in the cockpit!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bad fire, get us out!\nWe\u2019re burning up.\u201d Then, somebody screamed and they heard nothing else.\nEfforts to get them out took several minutes and they found the crew in a heap next to the hatch.\nThey had obviously been trying to undo it but simply couldn\u2019t in time.", "The Saturn V was the most powerful rocket built to date and consumed five and a half million pounds of fuel in just over two and a half minutes.\nHe prayed silently during the final seconds of the countdown.\nThe launch came off smoothly.\nWhen they tried to retrieve their LM from the compartment on the Saturn, some of the thrusters weren\u2019t working.\nThe culprit was a switch that had been accidentally bumped.\nSwitch covers would be included in the future.\nA few hours later, the Spider finally came out of the compartment.\nFor such a fragile spacecraft, the Spider held up well to the repeated firings of the Gumdrop\u2018s main engine over the next few days.\nThey were just getting ready to power up the Spider for testing when McDivitt sprang an unpleasant surprise on them.\nSchweickart had been space sick for days and might not be able to perform a planned spacewalk that would have taken him from the lunar module to the command module.\nThe people in Mission Control wished he had reported it sooner.\nThough the astronauts and NASA medical staff had never gotten along, the flight surgeon could have helped.\nIt certainly didn\u2019t help Scweickart\u2019s reputation or the image of the tough astronaut.\nFortunately, he was still able to perform most of the work.\nTests of the Spider\u2018s thrusters and descent engine went well.\nThe next day, Schweickart was feeling well enough to try his EVA.\nRetrieving some science packets from outside the LM wore him out and they decided to call off the planned transfer to the command module.\nThey were ready for the real test.\nThe LM was in good shape and Dave Scott reported that it looked good on his end, so Kranz gave them the go for separation.\nThe descent propulsion system quickly moved the Spider away from Gumdrop and Scott reported that he could see it to a distance of fifty miles.\nThey kept going out to one hundred miles.\nThe Spider\u2018s crew now had to reverse course and head back to the Gumdrop.\nThis meant firing the ascent engine as if they were returning from the moon.\nIf it didn\u2019t work, Dave Scott would have to perform the first space rescue and track them down.\nThe Spider successfully flew back to the point where Scott could dock with them again.\nThe highlights of the mission were a success.\nThe LM tests revealed only a few minor issues that were fixed easily enough.\nThe next Apollo was a full-dress rehearsal of the first lunar landing.", "As it was, Glenn\u2019s response to the retropack plan was pretty tart: \u201cWhat is the reason for this?\nDo you have a reason?\nOver.\u201d Shepard finally told him that they weren\u2019t sure whether the landing bag had deployed.\nAll three retro rockets fired on time and, as Glenn reentered, the Friendship 7 was surrounded by an ion buildup that blocked radio signals.\nIt was a tense wait for the people in Mission Control and those watching the live coverage of the mission.\nFinally, the spacecraft was spotted by the recovery ship USS Noa.\nJohn Glenn was brought on board to the cheers of the Noa\u2018s crew and got a taste of the nation-wide celebration to come when his route back to Cape Canaveral ended with an impromptu parade through the nearby Cocoa Beach.\nThe telemetry readings of the Segment 51 would turn out to be false.\nThe comrades in Mission Control celebrated with a big bash that night.", "Apollo 10 Kranz had been overloaded with controlling both the Lunar Module and the Command and Service Module during Apollo 9, so he decided to try the idea of having one flight director for each spacecraft for Apollo 10.\nOne director would work with EECOM and GNC while the other would work with a lunar module team made up of CONTROL, keeping track of guidance, attitude control propulsion and navigation, and TELMU, keeping track of electrical and environmental systems and EVA systems.\nLunney and Charlesworth weren\u2019t convinced.\nThe crew of Tom Stafford, Gene Cernan and John Young launched on May 18, 1969.\nThey had named their CSM Charlie Brown and their LM Snoopy.\nThis got the same howls from PR, leading NASA to decide that names for spacecraft would be serious from now on.\nThey were in lunar orbit three days later.\nAs planned, Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan took Snoopy down to within five miles of the lunar surface.\nThey were preparing to go back up when their navigation system went haywire.\nHearing a startled exclamation, \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d from the crew sent adrenaline spikes through the control center.\nThey reported that Snoopy had become a wild dog and they were forced to take manual control to make it up to Charlie Brown.\nThe crew splashed down safely and the concept of having two flight directors proved out well enough to convince Lunney and Charlesworth.\nThe stage was set for the first lunar landing.", "Mission Control\u2019s transfer to Houston was getting into high gear and Kranz sent out one of Control\u2019s new recruits, Manfred \u201cDutch\u201d Von Ehrenfried, as a real estate scout.\nKranz\u2019s only conditions were that the housing be affordable and that the down payment not be more than $250.\nThe part of Houston that Von Ehrenfried found for them came to be known as Flight Controller Alley.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) was also growing in size, from 750 to 1800 employees in three months.\nMany of these new people were brand-new graduates from colleges around Texas.\nA basic training course for flight controllers was set up.\nThe first class of six spent two weeksworth of twelve-hour days learning learning Morse code and speed printing.", "Gemini 7 went on to set an American endurance record that would stand until Skylab eight years later.\nAfter the success of Gemini 7/6, many of the controllers began to move over to Apollo, draining the Gemini team enough that Mission Control decided to go with a two-shift rotation for Gemini 8.\nGemini 8 March 16, 1966 Having only two shifts for a mission was a staffing mistake they never made again.\nBy the time the launch day for Gemini 8 arrived, Kranz and Hodge were both exhausted from planning, training, mission reviews and press conferences.\nThe crew, Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott, were going to rendezvous and dock with an Agena.\nThe Agena control team was made up of novices but was balanced out by an experienced Gemini team.\nThis time, Hodge\u2019s team got both the Agena and the Gemini on their way smoothly.\nThe crew and Mission Control were preparing for final rendezvous maneuvers when the White Team came on duty.", "Aurora 7 Deke Slayton was slated for the very next orbital mission with Wally Schirra as his backup.\nThings were going reasonably well until Slayton was making a centrifuge run and the physician detected a minor heart fibrillation.\nHe stopped the run and reported it.\nEven then, Slayton didn\u2019t expect problems.\nHe had made test flights in the F-105 without any trouble and didn\u2019t expect this to be any more serious.\nIt didn\u2019t turn out that way and Slayton was yanked from the flight.\nNormally, Wally Schirra would have stepped up to the plate as his backup, but they gave the flight to Scott Carpenter instead.", "The fuel cell situation began to stabilize, but it was obvious that they weren\u2019t able to operate at full power and some of the experiments were canceled.\nKraft wanted to go for a full day and began preparing for the handover.\nKranz expected a normal handover routine in which they would go over any outstanding issues.\nKraft was eager to get to the press conference and abruptly put his headset away.\nKranz didn\u2019t know if he had a plan.\n\u201cChris, what do you want to do?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the flight director; it\u2019s your shift.\nMake up your own mind.\u201d Kraft was handing him another test.\nGemini 5 was going to fly through a zone of poor coverage in the ground network and Kranz had an important Go/NoGo decision to make.\nSystems engineer John Aaron had helped design the fuel cells and suggested running a load test.\nKranz had the crew power up and then send an oxygen purge through the fuel cell.\nThis would hopefully get rid of excess moisture and impurities in the cell.\nHe timed it so that, if something went wrong, they could run on batteries until they could get to a convenient spot to start reentry.\nThe fuel cell held up to the load test and Kranz watched the oxygen flow to the fuel cell begin to increase gradually.\nBy the time Hodge\u2019s Blue Team took over, they had worked out a plan to power up systems incrementally for the next few days.\nHis team\u2019s handling of the crisis convinced Kranz that he was now a full-fledged flight director and, at the press conference at the end of the shift, he featured Aaron as the real hero for saving the fuel cell.\nThe mission made it almost the full eight days.\nKranz was forced to cut it one orbit short during his final shift so the crew wouldn\u2019t fall into a hurricane during reentry.\nThis gave him a perfect opportunity to pull a fast one on Llewellyn.\nScott Carpenter had just started his thirty-day Sealab mission and Llewellyn hadn\u2019t forgotten his line, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d Kranz recruited FIDO, RETRO and CapCom as co-conspirators and told them that he wanted to convince Llewellyn that the countdown for the retrofire would come from Sealab.", "The computing team responsible for planning the rendezvous were real heroes for working with calculators and computers that were cutting-edge at the time but only one step up from slide rules.\nTheir numbers indicated that, if Gemini 6 launched at 8:54 a.m. CST on December 12, 1965, they could perform the maneuvers necessary for the rendezvous.\nWally Schirra and Tom Stafford were up bright and early on launch day and went through the traditional launch routine that included a \u201clow-residue\u201d breakfast, a medical checkup, and suiting up for the ride.\nThe countdown went smoothly.\nThere were two abort controls that could be activated if there was trouble.\nOne was in Mission Control between booster engineer Charlie Harlan and CapCom C.C.\nWilliams.\nThe other was in the Gemini, located where Wally Schirra could grab and yank it.\nHarlan had exactly two worries at this point.\nNobody particularly liked the Gemini ejection system, so he did not want to call an abort when one wasn\u2019t necessary.\nNeither did he want to call an abort too late and risk losing a crew in a fireball.\nThe clock reached zero and the engines lit with the usual rumble intense enough to be felt inside the Gemini.\nThen, everything went quiet.\nFor an instant, Harlan wondered if they were having a repeat of \u201cKaputnik,\u201d an early American answer to Sputnik that had been lost in a launchpad explosion, with two crewmen inside.\nThen, he checked his readouts.\n\u201cNo liftoff!\u201d he told the flight director over the communications loop.\nIn the Gemini, nobody would have particularly blamed Wally Schirra if he had activated the ejection system.\nHowever, he was cool as a cucumber and realized that it would have been the wrong move.\nHe would comment later that having been through a launch once before helped.\nHe knew what liftoff felt like and knew by the lack of rising G-forces that they were still on the launchpad.\nHe and Stafford kept rattling off numbers.\nThe ground crew moved swiftly through the launch kill procedures.\nThe Titan\u2019s systems detected that launch hadn\u2019t occurred and engines shut down automatically.\nInspections revealed that an umbilical had released prematurely and a dust cover also hadn\u2019t been removed.\nSome people may have thought of \u201cThe Four-Inch Flight,\u201d in which a power cord had also caused a premature shutdown by disconnecting early.\nOnce again, they were lucky.\nThe ground crew went through an efficient turnaround and they were ready for the next launch window just three days later.", "Kraft probably remembered the time SimSup had told him that Kranz had gotten into an accident on the way to the Center.\n\u201cIs this your doing, SimSup?\u201d \u201cNot mine, Flight!\u201d Kraft told Hawaii to inform the Houston surgeon of Fendell\u2019s condition and kept his team on task.\nBucholz stepped up to the job beautifully.\nWhen it was over and Fendell rolled to his feet, a startled but relieved Hawaii team wondered how tell Kraft.\nKraft wasn\u2019t very happy but acknowledged the \u201cgotcha.\u201d Bucholz had passed his test and went on to critical ship assignments for the rest of Gemini.\nGemini 7 December 4 1965", "Launch day started even earlier for Gene Kranz than for Alan Shepard.\nHe left the hotel shortly after midnight, carpooling with MCC RETRO Carl Huss.\nHussappearance and habits reminded many of his colleagues of a bear and, like a bear coming out hibernation, he was slow to wake up.\nKranz enjoyed the early-morning silence and the searchlights in the distance assured him that the countdown was still running.\nEverything was on schedule when he arrived.\nKranz checked out communications on his and Kraft\u2019s console.\nKraft greeted him with his usual, \u201cHow\u2019s it going, young man?\u201d and Kranz responded with a thumbs-up.\nThen, Kraft was distracted by some issues with the worldwide data network and Kranz moved on.\nKranz described the moment when he heard Shepard had entered his spacecraft as \u201csurreal.\u201d This was the moment they had all waited for since signing up.\nThen, things started to go south.\nThey sat through five delays and the weather started to foul up.\nSome of them had to wonder if they were going to face another scrubbed launch.\nPencils tapped on desks and, during one delay, Kraft asked Kranz to get him a pint of milk from the lunch wagon to help calm his stomach.\nShepard was even less patient and barked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fix your little problem and light this candle?\u201d And then the most astonishing routine came over the communications loop.\n\u201cMy name?\nJose Jimenez.\nDo you know what it really takes to be an astronaut?\u201d \u201cNo, Jose, tell me.\u201d \u201cYou should have courage and the right blood pressure and four legs.\u201d \u201cWhy four legs, Jose?\u201d \u201cThey were going to send a dog.\nBut they decided that would be too cruel.\u201d Now who in the world would be playing a recording of comedian Bill Dana\u2019s cowardly astronaut routine at a time like this?\nKranz scrambled to find the cause.\nIf it was coming from anywhere in this room, he was history.\nBut, as it turned out, the launch pad crew were piping it into Shepard\u2019s spacecraft in an attempt to get him to lighten up.\nIt certainly added to the surreal feeling and got grins from a few people in Mission Control.\nFinally, the countdown resumed and reached zero at 9:34 am Eastern standard time.\nKranz was so excited that, when he left his station to go over to the Teletype machine, he forgot to remove his headset.\nThe cord snagged a chair and knocked it over.\nHe picked it up just as Shepard made his thirty-second report.\nThe Freedom 7 reached an apogee of 116 miles and Shepard tested roll, pitch and yaw manuevers as planned.\nThis assured the doctors whom Kranz considered too conservative that humans could function in space.\nFifteen minutes after launch, Shepard splashed down and was soon aboard recovery ship USS Lake Champlain.\nDuring NASA\u2019s early missions, only Public Relations chief Shorty Powers ever used the phrase \u201cA-OK\u201d during a mission and, years later, Kranz admitted that it was accurate if a little too Hollywood.\nAmerica was now in the manned space business and, in the wake of this victory, Kennedy set a new goal for NASA in a speech to Congress.\n\u201cI believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.\u201d Many people in NASA thought the President was too ambitious.\nGene Kranz could only think: \u201cWell, let them get on with their great plans.\nI\u2019m gonna put a man in orbit first.\u201d", "Gemini 1 was a fairly straightforward test of the Titan rocket and mission control did not get involved until it was time to review the data.\nGemini 2 would require controller support.\nChris Kraft and Gene Kranz went out to Cape Canaveral in what they hoped would be their final trip for a launch.\nThey shared a two-bedroom apartment to stretch the per diem they received from NASA.\nThe goal of the mission was a test of the Titan\u2019s propulsion and guidance system.\nIt would be a simple suborbital shot similar to the first two manned Mercury missions and they deployed two ships downrange to help monitor the mission.", "Apollo 8 December 21-27, 1968 Apollo 8 gave the trajectory people some interesting problems to figure out.\nMany of them remembered the complexity of rendezvous during Gemini and that was in Earth orbit.\nPerforming a rendezvous with another world 250,000 miles away was a whole different ballpark.\nWhile Kranz did not plan to participate in the control room for this mission, he did find opportunity to stop by.\nApollo 8 really belonged to Llewellyn and his team in the Trench, along with a fellow named Bill Tindall.\nTindall had been brought in to help pull things together after the Apollo 1 fire and Llewellyn\u2019s people sparred with him at first.\nTindall won their respect quickly enough and they spent a lot of time debating ideas.\nKranz had to fight the urge to jump in and help.\nThis was his first mission as FCD chief and he was understandably keyed up.\nHis team assured him that everything was on schedule and, the evening before the launch, they got a surprise visitor.\nCharles Lindbergh stopped by to say hello and Kranz chose to interpret it as a good sign.\n\u201cLucky Lindy\u201d had been the first to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and it seemed to Kranz like he was silently passing the baton on to the next generation of pioneers.", "Apollo 9 With the successful completion of Apollo 8, Kranz\u2019s team jumped right into preparations for Apollo 9.\nThe mission was meant to test the Lunar Module in Earth orbit and was scheduled to launch in two months.\nThey had gotten behind on preparations and, during one simulation, Gene Kranz proved that not even the flight director was immune to mistakes when he called an abort too late and sim-killed the crew by landing them in a mountainous area of Africa.\nIt was an embarrassing mistake but a good reminder not to get too relaxed during a mission.\nThe mission commander was James McDivitt with Dave Scott as the command module pilot and Russell \u201cRusty\u201d Schweickart as the lunar module pilot.\nThe crew came up with the names of Gumdrop for the CSM and Spider for the LM.\nThat got chuckles from some of the controllers while PR staff howled in outrage at the undignified names.\nThe entire crew caught colds before the launch date of February 28.\nNobody wanted to risk having another sick crew in space, so it was pushed back to March 3, 1969.\nThis was the first actual Apollo launch Kranz would be covering and he had \u201cStars and Stripes Forever\u201d playing in his head as he donned his white vest.", "Gene Kranz had just gotten dressed for a night out with his wife when he got a knock on the door.\nHe thought it was just the baby-sitter, so he called, \u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming.\u201d He went downstairs and the man at the door was flight controller Jim Hannigan.\n\u201cThey had a fire on the launchpad.\nThey think the crew is dead!\u201d Kranz turned on the TV to see what the reporters had found out so far.\nIt wasn\u2019t much.\nChris Kraft had acted quickly to lock down Mission Control so they could investigate.\nEnvisioning explosions and an inferno that consumed the entire pad, he rushed to the Center and had trouble finding a parking space.\nEvery available controller was reporting in to see what they could do to help.\nThe controllers still in the control room were too stunned to say much.\nThose still capable of focusing were going over data at their stations.\nMost of the rest were milling around, trying to make sense of the tragedy.\n\u201cIt was gruesome,\u201d was all John Hodge could get out.\nChris Kraft was on the phone with Deke Slayton.\nSlayton described fire spewing out from inside the capsule and molten metal running down the sides.\nThere was nothing more they could do for the crew.\nThey had lost three pilots in the worst way imaginable, in a ground test that shouldn\u2019t have been much of a risk.\nMost thought it had taken only seconds.\nIt was a harsh reminder of the hazards of space flight.\nKranz organized a meeting of his branch and flight control team in a nearby auditorium.\nAt Hodge\u2019s request, he also included the civil servants, Philco controllers and spacecraft contractors.\nHodge started the meeting with a briefing that included the information they knew so far.\nThen, Kranz took the podium.\nHe had gone from shock to anger and wanted to say something that would snap the people out of their own shock.\nHe had not planned a speech, but the words seemed to flow naturally anyway.\n\u201cSpaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity and neglect.\nSomewhere, somehow, we screwed up.\nIt could have been in design, build or test.\nWhatever it was, we should have caught it.\n\u201cWe were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw in each day of our work.\nEvery element of the program was in trouble and so were we.\nThe simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed Daily.\nNothing we did had any shelf life.\nNot one of us stood up and said, \u2018Dammit, stop!\u201cI don\u2019t know what Thompson\u2019s committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find.\nWe are the cause!\nWe were not ready!\nWe did not do our job!\nWe were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when we knew in our hearts it would take a miracle.\nWe were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did.\n\u201cFrom this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: \u2018Tough and Competent.Tough means that we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do.\nWe will never again compromise our responsibilities.\nEvery time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for.\n\u201cCompetent means we will never take anything for granted.\nWe will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills.\nMission Control will be perfect.\n\u201cWhen you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is write \u2018Tough and Competenton your blackboards.\nIt will never be erased.\nEach day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White and Chaffee.\nThese words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.\u201d", "Apollo 7 October 11-22, 1968 Apollo 7 was to be a simple shakedown of the command and service module.\nIt would also be the first three-man crew with Wally Schirra, Walter Cunningham and Donn Eisele and the first time the American public could watch a live mission through the on-board TV camera.\nWally Schirra was not thrilled with the idea.\nIn fact, the normally good-humored Mercury astronaut seemed to have suddenly turned into a grouch.\nGlynn Lunney oversaw the launch and handed things over to Gene Kranz.\nThings seemed to be proceeding smoothly so far.\nThen, Schirra reported that he had developed a cold and taken an Aspirin.\nLuckily, they had Kleenex on board though Schirra reported that he had to blow pretty hard to clear his nostrils.\nThe flight surgeon recommended a decongestant.\nHis crewmates caught his cold and it did nothing for the mood of any of them.", "Everything looked normal when Gemini 8 flew into a zone of no coverage.\nWhen they regained contact, Armstrong and Scott were rolling at a rate of one complete rotation per second.\nAt that rate, they risked blacking out.\nThe roll had started when they were still docked to the Agena and they had undocked, thinking something had gone wrong with the automated spacecraft.\nAs it turned out, one of their own thrusters was stuck open.\nArmstrong drained the orbital fuel trying to get the Gemini back under control and had to fire the reentry thrusters to stop the roll.\nThey would have to come back home.\nHodge\u2019s Blue Team had been on duty for eleven hours and was exhausted, so Hodge asked Kranz to take over.\nKranz called in his White Team and contacted recovery forces.\nGemini 8 was going to come down in an area not covered by the recovery network.\nArmstrong wasn\u2019t very happy about having to abort and spend time floating in the western Pacific Ocean but started the reentry procedures.\nGemini 8 lasted only ten hours and forty-one minutes but the rookie Agena team got two more days to practice controlling the Agena.\nThough Gemini 8 had been abortive, NASA had learned some important lessons.\nGene Kranz summed it up at the debriefing.\n\u201cWe got our crew home safely and the control teams did a damn fine job under real-time pressure.\nI know this is going to sound like Monday morning quarterbacking, but the lessons from the mission are how we screwed up in planning and training.", "Kranz was observing from one of the consoles in the back of the room when Bill Anders revealed his Christmas Eve surprise.\nHe began reading the Creation story from the Book of Genesis.\nKranz, a Catholic, felt chills go down his spine as Jim Lovell and then Frank Borman picked up the story.\nWhat could possibly be more appropriate?\nBorman closed it out with, \u201cAnd from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you \u2013 all of you on the planet Earth.\u201d As the crew settled into a route back to Earth, some of the controllers kidded about the possibility of actually hitting the carrier assigned to retrieve the crew during the final reentry phase.\nThe guidance system had improved that much.\nLuckily, that didn\u2019t happen and the Apollo 8 crew had a successful splashdown on December 27, 1968.", "There wasn\u2019t a single controller who didn\u2019t sympathize with Borman and Lovell.\nThe Gemini spacecraft was so small that they would effectively be confined to their seats for two weeks.\nIf they hadn\u2019t been working in weightless conditions, they would have inevitably developed pressure sores.\nThey wore lightweight suits designed only for use inside the spacecraft.\nTheoretically, they should have been able to get into those suits in less than twenty minutes, but in reality, it took about an hour.\nSpace food was still so unappetizing that no one who had actually tasted the stuff blamed John Young for smuggling a corned beef sandwich on Gemini 3.\nKranz compared it to a camper\u2019s worst nightmare and led efforts to keep the crew\u2019s morale up during the mission.\nThe launch of Gemini 7 went smoothly and the ground team wasted no time.\nThe Titan booster for Gemini 6 was on the pad within two hours.\nBorman and Lovell successfully rendezvoused with their own booster and flew in formation for a while.\nThen, they got started on medical experiments.\nThe suits might have been lightweight, but Borman and Lovell had a repeat of Scott Carpenter\u2019s suit heating problems during Aurora 7.\nWhen the crew reached Day 3 with little relief, Lovell stripped off his suit.\nMission Control wanted to let both of them remove their suits when medical data showed that Lovell was sleeping better, but NASA management refused to allow it.\nControl even tried playing the media card and told the press that the crew risked overheating in those suits to no avail.\nBorman and Lovell had to take turns wearing the suits.\nNASA procedure also called for nearly all communications between the crew and the ground to be available to the press.", "Launch of Apollo 11 Gene Kranz was up before sunrise on July 16, 1969.\nHe was even more psyched this day than he was on most launch days and all his wife could do was pack him a lunch and boot him out the door.\nOnce he was in the control room, he only betrayed his nervousness with the constant clicking of his ballpoint pen and sweaty palms that made pages from the logbook curl up.\nFor all that the other flight directors teased him about it, none of them could deny that they were tense today, as well.\nChris Kraft was sitting at the back of the room and kept asking Charlesworth about the status of the countdown.\nCharlesworth finally threatened to have him kicked out of the control room if he didn\u2019t cool it.\nThis was one of the few times when a flight director could talk back to his boss and Kraft desisted.\nAt first, the launch could have been just another simulation if it wasn\u2019t for the presence of luminaries like Bob Gilruth and the MCC\u2019s in-house PR representative, Jack Riley.\nRiley kept up a running commentary for the benefit of reporters outside the control room and, when Kranz overheard him saying something about \u201clunar landing mission,\u201d it sank in.", "Glenn\u2019s reports could have been mesmerizing if Kranz didn\u2019t have a job to focus on.\nHe reported a spectacular sunrise, and then the glittering \u201cfireflies\u201d surrounding his spacecraft.\nThose fireflies would turn out to be drops of frozen water from the spacecraft.\nKraft was less than impressed when Kranz relayed that to him.\n\u201cKeep me advised.\u201d The first orbit came to an end with no problems worse than a slight increase of temperature in the cabin.\nThen, Kraft dropped a bombshell on Kranz: \u201cShorty Powers has confirmed that the President will make a call at the end of the first orbit.\nGet with the communications people and make sure everything is set up.\u201d Kranz didn\u2019t like that very much.\nHe felt that it could have been arranged in advance.\nKraft only replied, \u201cThe President is the boss.\u201d As it turned out, the audio technicians were better informed than he was and had been expecting the call.\nAlan Shepard told Glenn, \u201cSeven, this is the Cape.\nThe President will be talking to you.\u201d Glenn was as surprised as Kranz had been.\n\u201cAh, the President?\nThis is Friendship 7, standing by.\u201d They had trouble patching the President through.\nThe techs gestured to each other for assistance as they stammered out, \u201cHello, Mister President!\u201d In another part of the room, the man monitoring the spacecraft\u2019s systems got Kranz\u2019s attention.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of this, but I\u2019m showing an indication of Segment 51.\u201d This was more serious than the President\u2019s phone call.\nSegment 51 was the impact bag deploy.\nIf that had somehow come undone, the heat shield was loose and John Glenn would burn up when he reentered the atmosphere.\nAs they tried to track down the indication, the chief audio technician had the unfortunate duty of telling the president, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten pretty busy down here!\u201d The president answered, \u201cGive me a call when you get the chance.\u201d Some of the readouts suggested that the Segment 51 was a false alarm, but they couldn\u2019t be certain.\nGlenn was troubleshooting some attitude control problems while Mission Control tried to make sense of the data they were getting from the remote sites.\nOnly about half those sites were seeing the Segment 51.\nSome of the design techs suggested making sure the landing bag switch was off and asking Glenn whether he had heard any banging noises when he maneuvered.\nWalt Williams and two of the designers joined Chris Kraft at his console and suggested leaving the retropack on during reentry in the hope it would keep the heat shield in place.\nKraft was convinced it was a false reading and didn\u2019t like that very much.\nWilliams asked, \u201cIf we come in with the retropack attached, what\u2019s the worst that could happen to us?\u201d Kranz could imagine Glenn\u2019s response if he could have heard that question: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018us\u2019?\u201d After a little more discussion, it was decided that they would keep an eye on it, but not to tell John Glenn because they didn\u2019t want to worry him.\nLeaving the retropack on could work, but only if all three retro rockets fired on time.\nIf they didn\u2019t, there was a chance one of the rockets could go off during reentry and kill Glenn.\nThe last orbit was the worst.\nThe controllers had no new data and they were trying to troubleshoot without letting Glenn know that he could be in serious trouble.\nGlenn figured out that something was up anyway and tried to get them to tell him what it was.\nWhen he returned to dry land, he would tell the controllers exactly what he thought of not having all the information available.", "The Apollo 11 Channel Preparing for Apollo 11 Gene Kranz made Charlesworth the chief flight director for Apollo 11.\nThis meant the leader of the Green Team would be in charge of assigning flight directors for each mission phase.\nHe walked into Kranz\u2019s office and spent a moment looking out the window before turning to Kranz with a smile.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to decide on the Apollo 11 phase assignments.\nI think I should launch Apollo 11 and do the EVA.\nMilt Windler will take the entry.\nThis leaves Glynn with the lunar ascent and you with the landing.\nIs this okay with you?\u201d Kranz agreed and, with that done, Charlesworth left his office.\nKranz promptly called home to share the good news with his wife, and then called his staff in.\nThere was no way he could sit still and perhaps they guessed the good news from the way he was pacing around his office.\nHe chose his landing team quickly.\nBob Carlton, dubbed \u201cThe Silver Fox\u201d for his gray hair, became CONTROL, responsible for LM navigation, control and navigation systems.\nAmong other things, he would be responsible for keeping track of how much fuel remained on the LM.\nDon Puddy became TELMU, responsible for communications, power and life support systems.\nHe appointed himself leader of the lunar module team.\nSteve Bales became GUIDO, responsible for guidance systems.\nHe had the black round-rimmed glasses characteristic of his nature as a computer whiz, and had a habit of speaking rapidly.\nFIDO was a New Yorker named Jay Greene who took on the self-appointed role of coaching Kranz in the trajectory work needed to land on the moon.\nRETRO was a cocky Trench veteran named Chuck Deiterich.\nHe had a bad habit of giving Flight either too much or too little information, once even giving Kranz some cheek: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear about that.\nIt\u2019s too technical.\u201d Ed Fendell took on a position that involved consolidating communications between the CSM and LM.\nIt was his idea to use the command module as a communications relay if they couldn\u2019t get a direct connection with the lunar module.\nHis attitude could be abrasive and he didn\u2019t get along well with some of the flight directors.\nKranz thought he did fine as long as he was kept on a short leash.\nCharlie Duke joined the team as Kranz\u2019s CapCom.\nHe integrated with the team so well that Kranz thought that he would have made an excellent flight director.\nWhile establishing the mission rules, Bill Tindall livened things up with his Tindallgrams.\nA typical Tindallgram might read: \u201cThere is another thing about powered descent crew procedures that really bugged me.\nJust call me \u2018Aunt Emma\u2019; certainly some smart people may laugh at my concern, but I just feel that the crew should not be diddling around with the computer keyboard during powered descent unless absolutely necessary.\nThey will never hit a wrong button, of course, but if they do, the results can be really lousy.\u201d Many of his Tindallgram ideas were incorporated into the mission rules, including changing the Go/NoGo decisions to Stay/NoStay for actual lunar activity.\nFor his efforts, Bill Tindall became an honorary flight director with Gray as a team color and Kranz invited Tindall to sit beside him for the lunar landing.\nTraining started eight weeks before the planned launch date.\nThey ran through the planned mission for the first couple of days to identify major Go/NoGo points and get a feel for what a \u201cnormal\u201d mission with no problems would be.\nA new SimSup named Dick Koos continued the tradition of imaginative simulation scripts that helped the control team refine procedures and mission rules.\nNot everything went perfectly.\nThe crew and controllers often trained together and that meant the computer network between the control room and crew simulators needed to stay up and running.\nWhen it didn\u2019t, SimSup had to contend with impatient astronauts and controllers while technicians tried to troubleshoot.\nIf things got too bad, Slayton and Kraft could get involved and things tended to snowball when training for subsequent missions got pushed back.\nSixteen-hour days were not uncommon.\nWhen the computer system did work, they nailed sim after sim until Koos decided that Kranz\u2019s team was beginning to get too overconfident and ratcheted up the pressure.\nKranz\u2019s team would remember June 10th as a killer.\nThey nailed the first few scenarios, but they turned out to be just warm-up rounds.\nOn the fourth run, the Trench allowed the LM\u2019s speed to build up too fast, resulting in a crash.\nOn the fifth, a combination of an electrical problem and a primary computer failure killed the crew.\nThe team\u2019s performance went downhill from there.\nIt got so bad that Chris Kraft gave Kranz a call.\n\u201cI listened to your runs today.\nSounds like you had a tough time.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kranz assured his boss that his team was only having a bad day and would get through it with more training and revisions of the mission rules.\nThings did improve for a while.\nA readiness review on June 17 revealed only one issue that sparked a debate that would last until the week before the launch.\nChris Kraft brought up the issue of landing data rules.\nMost controllers had made a bad call based on faulty telemetry data at some point during training.\nWould they be able to get enough telemetry data to make a decision on landing?\nKranz finally solved the issue by adding a mission rule: \u201cThe flight director will determine if sufficient data exists to continue the landing.\u201d This would insure that humans would make the final call where computers failed.\nBy July 5, the Apollo 11 crew had deployed to the Cape and the White Team was training with the Apollo 12 crew.\nThey had nailed six tough simulations, boosting their confidence.\nThe 12 prime crew switched places with their backup crew.\nThis would be the final simulation before Launch Day and Kranz\u2019s mind was already on the bits of business he had to take care of before the launch.\nIt turned out to be a mistake.\nSimSup had \u201cCase Number 26\u201d loaded into the simulation computers and told his men, \u201cOK, gang, let\u2019s see how much they know about program alarms.\u201d The GUIDO, Steve Bales, spotted a 1201 alarm on his readouts.\nHe had to look it up in an index file.\n\u201c1201-Executive Overflow-No vacant areas.\u201d For some reason, the computer was receiving more data than it could handle and had gone through a restart cycle.\nMission rules told him nothing, so he checked with his computer expert.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a BAILOUT alarm.\nThe computer is busier than hell and has run out of time to get all the work done.\u201d Still clueless, he watched the computer go through some more restarts.\nHe had to make up his mind.\n\u201cFlight, Guidance.\nSomething is wrong with the computer.\nI\u2019ve got a bunch of computer alarms.\nAbort the landing, abort!\u201d Kranz passed the abort command along to CapCom and it was executed perfectly.\nDick Koos told them, \u201cThat was not an abort.\nYou should have continued the landing.\u201d He skewered both Kranz and Bales for the mistake.\nIt was a lousy way to finish the team\u2019s training.\nSteve Bales was embarrassed and frustrated.\nHe promised Kranz that he would find out what he could and went off to make phone calls to MIT, which had developed the software.\nBy the end of it, they had a new mission rule listing the program alarms that would trigger an abort.\nNeither 1201 or 1202 were among them."]
