were bombed by Nato,\" wrote BBC correspondent Matthew Price.\nThe media corps held a meeting to discuss tactics as rebels entered Tripoli.\nThere have been fears among journalists for months that

him an \"off with his head\" type of trial in Libya.\nChris says he feels the key to the rebels' rapid success over the last few days was Nato.\nGaddafi could not replace the kit being blown up every day by Nato raids, but instead of shortening his lines, he kept them in place.\nThe rebels played a subsidiary role, says Chris: their own poorly planned attacks helped with attrition and the other key role was that by forcing Gaddafi to defend the front lines they made Gaddafi concentrate his tanks and guns on the frontlines, giving Nato handy targets.\nChris says the rebel National Transitional Council has a problem with legitimacy.\nIt took power in a revolution, but if it does anything certain tribes or sections of the population do not like, the result will be protests claiming they are dictators.\nIt will be interesting, Chris says, to see in the coming weeks whether the NTC brings forces from outside Tripoli in to control the capital.\nChris also says he has heard

(R2P) will get a boost out of the Libya case, and perhaps the case can be made that no-fly zones have proven their effectiveness.\nNato went further than that, though, and that troubles me \u2014 because that's not what the citizens of Nato countries were told would happen, and it's not what the UN sanctioned.\nThe usual blowhard neocon commentators are now using this not only to defend the idea of humanitarian interventionism, but to bash [Barack] Obama for not committing greater resources (and presumably more aggressive tactics) to Nato because it might have ended the civil war more quickly.\nThat's impossible to know, though, and to me remains as dubious as the argument that not intervening at all would have spared us six months of civil war and a Libya that might be

of the eccentricities of its leader, and despite the corruption and the secret police, Gaddafi's Libya also had most of the apparatus for government that would be found in a \"normal\" country.\nThe
