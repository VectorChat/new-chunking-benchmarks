["Another phenomenon in public discussion of the Kosovo war and the Balkans more generally has been the privileging of rape or mass rape of women over the slaughter or mass slaughter of (non-combatant) males.\nThe implicit prioritizing of sexually-assaulted women, often on ambiguous or scanty evidence, reflected both age-old biases and more recent feminist activism on the issue of mass rapes in Bosnia and elsewhere.\nWhile feminist research in this area is to be commended and learned from, it has also contributed to a one-sided depiction of the atrocities of war that tends to consign the male victim to oblivion.\nConsider the evaluation of the Bosnian war by Bogdan Denitch, otherwise one of the most clear-eyed appraisers of Yugoslavia's collapse:", "The point can be buttressed with a further example from Kosovo reporting.\nOne of the most widely-noted acts of gendercide during the war was the massacre at Izbica in early April.\nThe Christian Science Monitor (1999) related the events in only slightly less distorted a fashion than did the Post in reporting Racak: \"The Monitor tracked down three men who in separate interviews insisted they were among 60 or 70 people who helped to bury the dead.\nOne gave the number of victims as 148, with two survivors; the others spoke of 150, including several women..\" (emphasis added).\nRemarkably, in the entire Monitor story, it was nowhere stated that this \"worst massacre known in Kosovo\" was a truly towering act of gender-selective slaughter.\n(12)", "Some generalizations may be advanced on the basis of this extensive, if not rigorously systematic, sampling of Kosovo coverage.\nThe first is that males tend to assume the status of \"non-persons\" in analyses and reportage of conflict and genocide.\nMost commonly, they are effaced from the picture.\nIf their presence is noted at all, it is likely to be obliquely, with the gender variable subsumed by others (e.g., race/ethnicity, nationality, abstract \"victim\" status, colour of clothing).\nCampaigns aimed at the gender-selective killing of males will tend to be ignored or underemphasized in media coverage, in favour of a focus on secondary policies that target \"worthy\" victims (e.g., rape and harassment of women, forced expulsions).\nIf the character of \"gendercidal\" strategies is noted, it will tend to be relegated to the later and less prominent reaches of coverage.\nAll of these strategies can be isolated not only in media coverage, but in the humanitarian equation (e.g., the reports of organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International) and in policy statements by national governments, although there is no space to enter into a detailed discussion of these themes in the Kosovo context.\nVery similar patterns reasserted themselves during the slaughter in East Timor (September-October 1999), which followed upon the Kosovo war by a matter of mere months.\n(21)", "The war in Kosovo between March and June 1999, tragic as it was, offered an ideal opportunity to analyze the representation and rhetoric of gender in western mass media.\nAn overriding Serb strategy in the conflict was \"gendercide\" against non-combatant men- the same strategy Serb forces had followed from the outset of Yugoslavia's war of dissolution.\n(1) From the first day of the war in Kosovo (24 March 1999), and indeed long before, the Serbs overwhelmingly targeted \"battle-age\" men for the most severe atrocities, although women, the elderly, and children were also exposed to a wide range of abuses and war crimes, ranging from killings to rape and forced expulsion (Jones, 1994).\nThe report issued after the Kosovo war by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was emphatic in pointing to these gender- and age-selective strategies:", "Effacing the Male: Gender, Misrepresentation, and Exclusion in the Kosovo War by Adam Jones, Ph.D.\nPublished in Transitions: The Journal of Men's Perspectives, 21: 1-3 (2001).\nABSTRACT The Kosovo war of 1999 offered an excellent opportunity to analyze the representation of gender and violent victimization in the mass media.\nThe present article focuses on the motif of \"gendercide,\" or gender-selective mass killing- in this case, of \"battle-age\" ethnic-Albanian men.\nA broad sample of media commentary is presented to demonstrate that \"unworthy\" male victims tend to be marginalized or ignored entirely in mass-media coverage.\nA trio of common marginalization strategies is discussed, and a theoretical framework of \"first-order,\" \"second-order,\" and \"third-order\" gendering is proposed to clarify the deficit in coverage.\nThis deficit is then contrasted with the attention given to the victimization experiences of \"worthy\" victims, such as women, children, and the elderly.\nFinally, the small handful of responsible and insightful media reports on gender-selective atrocities against Kosovar men is evaluated for the alternative it may offer to \"effacing the male\" from coverage of war and violence.", "The analytical befuddlement to which this strategy rapidly leads was exemplified by a 22 April 1999 story in The Washington Post, \"Accounts of Serbian Atrocities Multiplying.\"\nAs the headline suggests, this was one of the Post's major attempts to confront the scale and patterning of the Serb rampage in Kosovo.\nThe article featured several examples of the displacement strategy mentioned above, referring to \"scores of accounts of Yugoslav forces killing small groups of ethnic Albanian civilians\" and the \"'summary, random executions of small groups,'\" although the vast majority of the atrocities specifically mentioned in the article were not at all random- they fit the standard gender-selective pattern.\n(10) But the most astonishing reference in the Post story was to \"the [Yugoslav] government's role in the massacre of dozens of women and children at the Kosovo village of Racak\" in January 1999.\nThis is the prewar massacre for which international monitors gave a breakdown of 31 victims as follows:", "This dubious hierarchizing of human suffering was implicit throughout much of the discussion of the rape controversy during the Kosovo war.\nFor example, James Rubin on 13 April called for Yugoslavia to \"take immediate steps to punish the perpetrators of rape and other crimes..\" (Rubin quoted in Agence France-Presse, 1999c.)\nReporting David Scheffer's comments on the massacre at Velika Krusa, where (as the story notes) \"Yugoslav troops gunn[ed] down more than 100 men and boys between ages 14 and 50,\" The Washington Post added: \"At the Pentagon, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon revealed that U.S. officials had received reports of an even more ghastly crime of mass rape followed by executions\"- i.e., up to 20 deaths at the alleged \"rape camp\" near Djakovica.\nTwenty raped and murdered women was \"even more ghastly\" than 100 men shot and burned to death- some indication of the relative value of the worthy versus unworthy victims.\n(Loeb and Smith, 1999; emphasis added.\n)(15)", "My sample of media coverage was broadest and most rigorous between 26 March and 25 April.\nThis month-long period surely encompasses weeks when intimations of humanitarian disaster and \"gendercide\" were widespread, and confronted western governments and organizations, as well as media observers, with critical moral and practical choices.\nDuring this period, the sample set turned up only the most fragmentary glimpses of a crisis in Kosovar male ranks.\nPerhaps the most consistently attentive media outlet was the Agence France-Presse, which regularly issued dispatches citing David Scheffer's (and later the U.S. Information Agency's) estimates of 100,000 or more men \"unaccounted for.\"\nAs early as 26 March, the AFP delivered a succinct second-order framing of the \"disturbing reports of mass killings trickl[ing] out of Kosovo.\"\nIt cited U.S. State Department spokesperson James Rubin's reference to \"ominous indications that men of fighting age were separated from their families,\" as did a number of other sources; but it went further, with a brief third-order reference to the fact that \"Such separations of men from women was [sic] commonplace in massacres carried out during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia between Moslems, Serbs and Croats.\"\n(Agence France-Presse, 1999d.)\nTo be sure, this is not a very extensive or sophisticated third-order framing, and the depiction of gendercide in Bosnia as the result of a \"war.. between Moslems, Serbs and Croats\" rather blurs the primary agents of the slaughter.\nIndeed, it is pathetic that such passing references have to be unearthed like precious", "19.\nI have attempted no broad sampling of broadcast media in this study.\nBut I feel I should point to CNN's Christiane Amanpour as unusual among such media workers in her early attention to the phenomenon of the missing men.\nReporting from the refugee camps in Albania on 30 March 1999, Amanpour asked straightforwardly: \"Where are the men?\"\nYoung men, she said, were notably underrepresented in the refugee convoys: there were \"very few men coming out.. the tractor-trailers are full of women and children.\"\nAmanpour said she asked the occupants of the refugee convoys about the fate of the men.\nThe answers: some were in hiding, some were joining the fight against the Serbs, and others had been detained and led away to destinations unknown.\nShe referred to \"an appalling picture and a consistent picture\" of the gender-selective atrocities being committed by the Serbs.\nThis was all tougher and more to-the-point than anything else I saw broadcast at the time.\n20.\nFisher's article originally ran in The New York Times on 30 May, under the heading: \"The Men: Missing Refugees Turn Up With Accounts of Abuse.\"\nThere is no headline focusing on \"The Men\" in Kosovo at any point in the two months of Times coverage preceding the mass release from Smrekovnica.", "The framing of the first excerpt is notable.\nThe experience of women rape victims is placed against a backdrop, not only of the Kosovo war and the wider Balkans conflict, but of humanity's \"ancient ways.\"\n(Note also the headline referring to \"rape as a weapon of war.\")\nThe second-order framings in all of the excerpts are powerful and detailed.\nAnd what these brief extracts do not capture is the nuanced and highly-personalized treatment generally given to the individual female victims.\nThe reader cannot help but be drawn into their stories and suffering, and respond with moral outrage, which is presumably the intent.\nIn stark contrast, I have never seen a detailed third-order treatment of the gendercidal killings of males in Kosovo (my own aside), let alone one with a historical scope comparable to the first excerpt.\nBut the slaughter of \"battle-age\" non-combatant men is at least as prominent and enduring a \"weapon of war,\" in the Balkans and throughout history, as is the rape of women- and a more brutal and severe one, by any reasonable standard.\nEven second-order framings were exceedingly rare and usually fleeting.", "Smith, R.J.

(1999).\n\"Accounts of Serbian Atrocities Multiplying.\"\nThe Washington Post, 22 April.", "Speaking of the entire month-long sample, I found only one article, by Alan Freeman of The Globe and Mail, that actually focused on the mass detention and apparent gender-selective killing of Kosovar males.\nBy \"focusing,\" I mean with both a headline and a lead that alludes to the subject.\nIt appeared in The Globe on 6 April, and deserves to be cited at length:", "A third-order gendering extends the analysis beyond the boundaries of the immediate conflict, region, and contemporary time-frame.\nIt usually seeks to make broad generalizations about regional, global, and/or historical trends.\nAgain to use our Kosovo examples, this might involve placing the rape of Kosovar women against the broader backdrop of rape as a tool of war in the Balkans in the 1990s.\nIt might go further still, and examine the sexual assault of women as a feature of warfare across civilizations and throughout history.\nA similar perspective on gender-selective executions of men would seek to place these killings against a regional and global-historical backdrop.\nI take it as a normative and analytical \"given\" that while first-order, second-order, and third-order treatments may be entirely worthy in and of themselves, second-order and third-order framings are necessary if an effective gender analysis is to be mounted.\nThat is to say, the analysis cannot remain stuck at the level of individual cases or conflicts if it is to contribute to a sophisticated understanding of gender.\nIndeed, any conceptualization of \"gender\" is inconceivable without a second- and third-order framing.\nA scholarly analysis that confines itself to first-order analyses may turn up extraordinarily useful and important material.\nBut such analyses cannot buttress reality-claims beyond their own pre-set boundaries.", "For every media category, the coverage of the worthy victim, Popieluszko, exceeded that of the entire set of one hundred unworthy victims taken together.\nWe suspect that the coverage of Popieluszko may have exceeded that of all the many hundreds of religious victims murdered in Latin America since World War II, as the most prominent are included in our hundred.. [W]e can also calculate the relative worthiness of the world's victims, as measured by the weight given them by the US mass media.\nThe worth of the victim Popieluszko is valued at somewhere between 137 and 179 times that of a victim in the US client states; or, looking at the matter in reverse, a priest murdered in Latin America is worth less than a hundredth of a priest murdered in Poland.\n(Herman and Chomsky, 1988: 39.)\nThe concept of \"worthy\" versus \"unworthy\" victims seems a fertile one in analyzing the treatment of the victims of the gendercidal atrocities in Kosovo, and male victims of violence more generally.\n(5) In this section, I sketch some of the predictable, even ritualized, means by which \"unworthy\" male victims were excluded from the analysis, and \"worthy\" ones notably children and women- privileged.\n(6)", "Let us now consider the press coverage of Kosovar men according to this framework.\nIt can be said with confidence that only the barest fragments of first- and second-order framings emerged in this coverage.\nOne can see glimmers of comprehension in the occasional references to a pattern of male-selective killing in the Balkans conflict, and the attention paid to the phenomenon of male detentions and disappearances after the release of the inmates from Smrekovnica and Liplje prisons in May 1999 (see below).\nBut the coverage in no way approximated the kind of nuanced historical analysis that imbued treatments of Kosovo's women rape victims.\nFor the most part, the civilian male victims of the slaughter were buried in a slew of other designations- \"Kosovar,\" \"ethnic-Albanian,\" etc.\n-- and their specific vulnerabilities were thereby blurred into the larger backdrop of ethnic conflict.", "Let it be stated plainly: \"Including women\" excludes men.\nTo get a better sense of the origins and implications of the phrase, substitute \"including Europeans.\"\n(Indeed, the systematic exclusion of one category of victims, and the implicit prioritizing of the minority category, is very similar to colonial discourses in Victorian times.)\nThe trope is particularly misleading when the phenomena described- such as the massacre at Velika Krusa and the campaign of mass killing in Kosovo as a whole- are so disproportionately and methodically slanted against males.\nIn virtually all cases, the phrase \"including women and children\" can be translated as \"including a majority of adult men and a minority of women and children.\"\nBut men remain the \"absent subjects,\" entering the narrative only indirectly and by inference, if at all.\n(8)", "Good as Daniszewski's piece was, though, it again limited itself to the Kosovo context, failing to place the gendercide in regional, let alone global-historical, perspective.\nThis largely exhausted the attempts to conceptualize and report the \"genocidal cull of.. males\" in Kosovo during the critical first month of the slaughter.\nThe New York Times, The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, the BBC, The Guardian- all appear to have published nothing comparable to the tiny smattering of articles sampled above.\nEven the provision of one or two counter-examples- an editorial here, a column there- would hardly offset the general impression of a conspiracy of low-key mumbles, if not outright silence, on the gendercidal assault against ethnic-Albanian males.\n(19) The release of about two thousand men from Smrekovnica and other Serb detention facilities, in late May 1999, marked the one occasion on which victimized males came to the forefront of the discussion.\nThe result was some solid and nuanced reporting of the men's experiences.\nThis came very late in the game, however, and it was notable how infrequently terms like \"torture\" were applied to the men's experiences.\nMore common were phrases like \"mistreatment,\" \"maltreatment,\" \"beatings,\" \"abuse\"- all of which seems inadequate to capture the sadism of the Serb jailers (akin, perhaps, to describing rape as \"unwanted sexual attention\").", "Neither The New York Times nor The Washington Post- the two major \"agenda-setting\" newspapers in the United States published a single story or editorial focusing on the phenomenon of gender-selective mass executions.\nThe closest the Times came to a meaningful \"second-order\" and \"third-order\" gendering of the slaughter, to my knowledge, was a story by John Kifner, early in Operation Horseshoe: \"What is striking about the refugees is that they are largely women, children and old men.\nThe young men, they say, are either hiding in the mountains or have been separated out by the Serbs and taken away to some unknown fate.\nWhile there is no way to verify independently the accounts of killings.. their similarity suggested that they were credible.\nEarlier Serbian efforts to remove Muslims from parts of Bosnia were accompanied by numerous massacres.\"\n(Kifner, 1999.)\nThe excerpts came eight paragraphs into the story, and the \"striking\" subject was then dropped.\nCertainly it was never deemed worthy of a story in its own right.\nThe flicker of a higher-order gendering (that is, the isolation of a pattern, and the citing of the Bosnian precedent) was about as faint as could be.", "There was precisely one reference to \"men\" in the story: to the \"masked [Serb] men with rifles\" hovering around the facility.\nMales as agents of violence were visible, and gendered; as victims, they were effaced from the discourse.", "One other Globe article, by Geoffrey York, deserves honourable mention for a forceful second-order gendering.\nYork zeroed in on the firestorm that had descended upon Kosovar males:", "Young men were the group that was by far the most targeted in the conflict in Kosovo.. Clearly, there were many young men involved in the UCK [Kosovo Liberation Army].. but every young Kosovo Albanian man was suspected of being a terrorist.\nIf apprehended by Serbian forces- VJ [Yugoslav army], police or paramilitary- the young men were at risk, more than any other group of Kosovo society, of grave human rights violations.\nMany were executed on the spot, on occasion after horrendous torture.\nSometimes they would be arrested and taken to prisons or other detention centres, where, as described afterwards by men released from such detention, they would be tortured and ill-treated, while others would simply not be seen again.\nOthers were taken for use as human shields or as forced labour.\nMany young men \"disappeared\" following abduction.\n(2) The present article, based on a broad sampling of media coverage during and after the war, explores how this reality was conveyed- or not conveyed- by major western news media.\nIt is my conviction that the strategies are of relevance far beyond the Kosovo case, and indeed beyond the theme of gender and international conflict; they speak to the typical means by which male victims of violence are marginalized or \"effaced\" from the prevailing media and human-rights discourse.\nThe sources consisted of the following:", "The Post, for its part, did publish an editorial, \"Captive in Serbia,\" pointing out that \"Many Kosovars, particularly men, are being held captive,\" and referring to \"the imprisonment of some Kosovo men\" as \"undoubtedly part\" of a \"planned.. destruction of ethnic Albanian Kosovo as a working society.\"\nBut the editorial appeared on 1 July, more than three months after the outbreak of the war and weeks after its end.\nIt concerned itself, moreover, only with the thousands of prisoners transported alive from Kosovo to Serbia at the end of the Yugoslav occupation.\n(The Washington Post, 1999.)\nMight some concerted attention to the pattern of gender-selective detentions and mass killings earlier in the conflict have changed the course of the gendercide?\nBut the reader was again confronted, in Post coverage, with only glancing references to \"men missing\" and \"summary executions of men,\" except on the rare occasions when policymakers stressed the particular vulnerability of \"battle-age\" males.\n(18) The contrast with the coverage of women rape victims was striking.\nWe have already seen that on regular occasions the rape of women was privileged over the murder of non-combatant males.\nFurthermore, virtually every news outlet ran at least one story on the subject; second-order and third-order framings, placing the crime against the backdrop of the Balkans war and even the whole history of human conflict, were standard.\nConsider, for example, the following reports:", "jewels in the media coverage, and presented as examples of what should have been a generalized and much more in-depth media treatment.\nBut the AFP, with many lapses into blindness and banality like other media, nonetheless stood out for the frequent attention it paid- virtually alone- to the fate of Kosovo's men.", "11.\nThe Post did not publish a letter seeking to correct the error.\nFor another example of this strategy, which is not uncommon, see Moutot, 1999.\nThis article referred to Racak only slightly less misleadingly as an \"attack on a fleeing column of some 40 civilians, old men, women and children.\"\nThe core component, the slaughter of \"battle-age\" males, was invisible in this equation.\nCuriously, a subsequent AFP dispatch (Agence France-Presse, 1999b) noted the death at Racak of \"Ajet Emini.. along with 44 other men.\"\nThis, although much closer to the truth, is not accurate either, since between one and three women were apparently among the 45 victims.\n12.\nThe most detailed tabulation of the Izbica death-toll that I have seen was provided by Ellen Knickmeyer of the Associated Press, who gave a breakdown of \"142 people.. [killed] from March 28 to May 10.\"\n\"In all,\" Knickmeyer writes, \"seven of the victims were women.\nTwo were children.\nNinety-eight were men older than 50, up to the age of 102.\"\nThus, if the 142 tally is accepted, adult males constituted 133 of the victims (94 percent).\nBut this framing was not uppermost in Knickmeyer's mind (note the placement of women, children, and elderly men ahead of the wider gendercidal component).\n13.\nOblivious to the contradiction, Janowski mentions later in the article: \"Women are telling stories of their men being tortured and shot.\nIt's completely out of control.\"", "Perhaps the most bizarre example of the displacement strategy employed during the war came in mid-April, when the subject of Kosovar men used as forced labourers surfaced in press briefings and subsequent media coverage.\nThe BBC began its report on \"Kosovo 'grave gangs'\" with the claim that \"Kosovo Albanians dressed in red [were] being forced to move dead bodies and dig graves\"- a strange emphasis, given the subsequent acknowledgment that these crimson-clad Kosovars were all \"men and boys.\"\n(BBC Online, 1999a; emphasis added.)\nBy the time the story reached the Press Association, the gender variable had disappeared completely: \"Chilling new evidence has emerged of Serbian attempts to cover up massacres of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\nArmed Forces Minister Doug Henderson said he had received 'disturbing reports' of unarmed civilians dressed in red transporting bodies away from atrocity sites.\"\nThe story quoted Henderson as stating: \"To cover up atrocities, the Serbs are using civilians dressed in red to clear up massacres.\nThey are clearing bodies well away from where massacres have occurred.\"\n(Press Association, 1999; emphasis added.)\nAs the Kosovar men buried the dead, so were they largely buried in the policy equation and public discussion.\nThe Press Association report managed to go its entire length with the gender of the chain-ganged gravediggers unmentioned, although the colour of the prisoners' dress was noted twice, and the children, mother, and grandmother among a group of refugee landmine victims (the main focus of the story) were carefully designated.", "The emphasis in the first passage is on the presence and newsworthiness of \"many\" women and children (which is, after all, what one would expect in any demographically-representative population).\nIn the second, the cowardliness of the Serb forces is exemplified by their murder of every element of the civilian population except \"battle-age\" males.\nThe manifestly most vulnerable demographic is the only one not represented in the formulation- except insofar as the killing of defenseless battle-age men is seen as a legitimate test of the Yugoslav army's power and machismo.\n(9) (As R.J. Rummel put it in a different context, \"One would think that murdering an unarmed man was a heroic act.\"\n[Rummel, 1994: 323.])", "physical and psychological terror stemmed largely from the barbaric treatment inflicted in the prison camps created by both Croats and Serbs- particularly, in the case of the Serbs, the notorious Omarska camp with its raping of women.\n(di Francesco and Scotti, 1999.)\nThis depiction of the horrors of Omarska- one of the three concentration camps closed after international protests in late 1992- is a mind-bogglingly casual inversion of the gendered reality.\nHelsinki Watch gave the population of Omarska as 2,000 men and 33 to 38 women.\nIn an article for International Affairs on \"The Crime of Appeasement in Bosnia,\" Ed Vulliamy, who witnessed the release of Omarska's survivors, wrote: Omarska had been a place where a prisoner was forced to bite the testicles off a fellow inmate who, as he died of pain, had a live pigeon stuffed into his mouth to stifle his screams.\nThe guards responsible for this barbarism were described by one witness as \"like a crowd at a sporting match.\"\nAnother man was forced to bark like a dog and lick at motor oil on the ground while a guard jumped up and down on his back until it snapped.\nPrisoners, who survived by drinking their own and each other's urine, were constantly being called out of their cramped quarters, by name.\nSome would return caked in blood, bruised black-and-blue or slashed with knives;
