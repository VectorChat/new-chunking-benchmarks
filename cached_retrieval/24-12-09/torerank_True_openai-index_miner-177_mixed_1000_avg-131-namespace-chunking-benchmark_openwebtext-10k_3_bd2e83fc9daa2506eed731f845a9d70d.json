["Mission Control believed otherwise.\nKranz, in particular, felt that the astronautsproper role at the remote sites was as observers and assistants.\nFive days before the launch of the first manned Gemini, Astronauts Pete Conrad and Neil Armstrong went out to the remote sites at Carnarvon and Hawaii, respectively.\nOnce Pete Conrad got to Carnarvon, he encountered Dan Hunter, who was in charge of the station.\nBoth were equally strong-willed and it would lead to a showdown that would provide greater clarity of the roles of both Mission Control and the Astronaut Office during the flight.\nThe trouble started while Kranz and Kraft were still in Florida after Gemini 2.", "Somehow, they kept it to mere words and talked it out until three in the morning.\nThey cut a deal that would work for the short-term.\nHunter would be in charge of the station, and Conrad would be in charge of real-time operations during the mission.\nKranz had the changes Teletyped out to the remote stations in Carnarval and Hawaii.\nHunter didn\u2019t seem to know when to back down and, the day before Gemini 3 was due to launch, gave Kranz a message to relay to Kraft.\n\u201cThis message doesn\u2019t resolve anything.\nI am going to have it framed and hanged on the wall of my bathroom.\u201d Chris Kraft\u2019s patience was gone.", "Deke Slayton was in town, too, and received word that Conrad and Hunter had gotten into a heated argument over who was in charge.\nHunter had threatened to kick Conrad out of the station for butting into his turf and the hapless station crew sent a message asking for clarification about whose orders they should follow.\nHe went straight to the apartment where Kranz and Kraft were staying.\nThey had fallen asleep, but the banging on the door woke them right up.\nSlayton shouted, \u201cChris, we got a problem!\u201d Kranz threw on some clothes and, by the time he got out there, Kraft and Slayton were about ready to duke it out.\n\u201cDammit, Chris, get your guy under control!\u201d snarled Slayton.", "Cooper had come up with the slogan \u201cEight Days or Bust\u201d for the mission.\nThe public relations department didn\u2019t like that very much and suppressed it until after the mission.\nConrad had recovered nicely from his spat with Hunter before Gemini 3 and Kranz liked his intensity and honesty.\nIt turned out to be a good match for Gemini 5.\nThe oxygen flow to the fuel cells dropped to alarming levels during the first orbit.\nThinking fast, the crew abandoned the planned rendezvous maneuver and powered down equipment.\nKraft could have aborted the mission right then, but decided to give it a few more orbits to troubleshoot and see if the oxygen levels began to level out.", "They sat through five delays and the weather started to foul up.", "The cord snagged a chair and knocked it over.", "Finally, the countdown resumed and reached zero at 9:34 am Eastern standard time.", "Pencils tapped on desks and, during one delay, Kraft asked Kranz to get him a pint of milk from the lunch wagon to help calm his stomach.", "Then, things started to go south.", "Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we.\nThe simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed Daily.\nNothing we did had any shelf life.\nNot one of us stood up and said, \u2018Dammit, stop!\u201cI don\u2019t know what Thompson\u2019s committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find.\nWe are the cause!\nWe were not ready!\nWe did not do our job!\nWe were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when we knew in our hearts it would take a miracle.\nWe were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did.", "Some of them had to wonder if they were going to face another scrubbed launch.", "Shepard was even less patient and barked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fix your little problem and light this candle?\u201d And then the most astonishing routine came over the communications loop.", "They even got into the ongoing debate about the route they would take to the moon.\nOne favorite route was called Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR), in which astronauts would rendezvous with a spacecraft already in orbit and land that spacecraft on the moon.\nAnother route was an underdog called Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR), in which a crew of three astronauts would go into lunar orbit, and then two of them would undock in a smaller spacecraft and land it on the moon.\nNAA took the EOR side, which would give them full control of manufacturing the spacecraft.\nNorth American turned out a spacecraft that was so riddled with problems that Gus Grissom hung a lemon on it.", "\u201cMy name?", "\u201cYou have your orders, young man!\u201d If Kraft had his way, Hunter wasn\u2019t going to have much of a future in Mission Control.\nAt the customary party on the evening before the launch, the tension between Kraft, Kranz and Slayton had spread to the rest of the controllers and the astronauts and there was none of the usual mingling.\nLlewellyn had too much to drink and tried to start a fight with Alan Shepard.\nKranz intervened and got him out of there.\nThe Gemini 3 crew, Gus Grissom and John Young, had been unaware of trouble before the party but it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out that something was up.\nKranz decided that this was no way to run a mission.", "He would acknowledge that she was an extraordinary woman for sticking with him when he was spending so many long, stressful hours in the Mission Control Center.\nIn the meantime, the Atlas suffered two failures that needed to be sorted out before Cooper could go up in the Faith 7.\nThe launch was pushed back again when the Atlas booster failed an inspection on the launch pad.\nThe problems were solved and the booster passed a second inspection.\nThe launch date for the final Mercury flight was set for May 15, 1963.\nCooper\u2019s mission would last for 34 hours and 22 orbits.", "It turned out to be a mistake.\nSimSup had \u201cCase Number 26\u201d loaded into the simulation computers and told his men, \u201cOK, gang, let\u2019s see how much they know about program alarms.\u201d The GUIDO, Steve Bales, spotted a 1201 alarm on his readouts.\nHe had to look it up in an index file.\n\u201c1201-Executive Overflow-No vacant areas.\u201d For some reason, the computer was receiving more data than it could handle and had gone through a restart cycle.\nMission rules told him nothing, so he checked with his computer expert.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a BAILOUT alarm.\nThe computer is busier than hell and has run out of time to get all the work done.\u201d Still clueless, he watched the computer go through some more restarts.", "The first manned Gemini mission launched on March 23, 1965.\nThough the official documentation called it Gemini-Titan 3, Gus Grissom had named the spacecraft the Molly Brown.\nNASA Public Relations hated it but the name was all over the newspapers after the Houston Capcom gave them the send-off, \u201cYou\u2019re on your way, Molly Brown!\u201d The mission was a success.\nAfter Grissom and Young splashed down, Kraft went to Slayton and cut a deal.\nThe astronauts would be in charge of the spacecraft and Mission Control would be in charge of the mission.\nHunter was transferred to the Goddard Space Flight Center and became the Madrid tracking station manager during Apollo.", "\u201cFrom this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: \u2018Tough and Competent.Tough means that we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do.\nWe will never again compromise our responsibilities.\nEvery time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for.\n\u201cCompetent means we will never take anything for granted.\nWe will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills.\nMission Control will be perfect.\n\u201cWhen you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is write \u2018Tough and Competenton your blackboards.\nIt will never be erased.", "Kranz was so excited that, when he left his station to go over to the Teletype machine, he forgot to remove his headset.", "Do you know what it really takes to be an astronaut?\u201d \u201cNo, Jose,

cruel.\u201d Now who in the world would be playing a recording of comedian Bill Dana\u2019s cowardly astronaut routine at a time like this?\nKranz scrambled to find the cause.", "Kranz had a hard time keeping a straight face as he explained, \u201cWe have orders to patch communications through to Sealab so Carpenter can give the countdown for the retrofire.\nI argued with Kraft about it but he says, \u2018Do it!\n'\u201d Llewellyn was furious and inadvertently pulled Dave Scott into the gotcha by telling him all about the fictional test.\nScott blew up and threatened to quit the program if this was the kind of crazy decision he could expect during a mission.\nKranz let them both dangle for a few more minutes before explaining that it was all a joke.\nKranz had taken up Judo at Llewellyn\u2019s invitation and realized that the evening\u2019s match was going to be an especially rough one.", "This was the controllersfavorite bar, where they celebrated successes and mourned losses.\nFor a little while, it looked like Gemini 6 wasn\u2019t going to happen.\nThen, somebody had an inspired idea.\nGemini 7 was going to go up before too long.\nWhy not make it the target vehicle for the Gemini 6 rendezvous?\nThough neither side in the Space Race had mastered rendezvous yet, the Russians had already demonstrated their capacity for running two missions at once.\nCould the Americans do the same?\nThey were certainly going to find out and Gemini 6 and 7 came to be known collectively as Gemini 7/6.", "If it was coming from anywhere in this room, he was history.", "DPS DELTA V indicated that the thrust hadn\u2019t built up fast enough.\nThey would have to reset the timer.\nThe other one was simply labeled, FORGET IT.\nThis meant that the command to throttle up the engine had not been executed.\nThey extended the mission by an orbit to see if they could still accomplish all their goals.\nSending commands went from being a hassle to being a major problem due to poor signal strength.\nThe controllers ended up punching in commands manually.\nKranz did not want to lose the test of the LM\u2019s abort system, so he decided to ditch all the other tests if he absolutely had to and focus on that one.", "While going over the stowage and pre-retro checklists with the Zanzibar CapCom, Cooper reported, \u201cMy automatic control system inverter has failed.\nI\u2019ll have to make a manual reentry.\u201d Zanzibar asked, \u201cHave you tried the standby inverter?\u201d \u201cRoger.\nIt would not start.\u201d They continued with the checklist, and then Cooper made contact with Coastal Sentry: \u201cOh, my automatic inverter failed along with a few other odds and ends.\nI will shoot the retros on manual and then reenter manually also.", "\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been benched.\u201d Von Ehrenfried filled in as assistant flight director and did fine.\nJust before Cooper\u2019s flight, he got a local hospital to provide an electrocardiogram of somebody having a heart attack, fed it into the simulation, and stood back and laughed up his sleeve while the physicians tried to figure it out.\nThat taught the physicians that an astronaut might not have time for doctors to argue over the diagnosis.\nBrooks became notorious for his challenging simulations.\nKranz\u2019s family was still growing.\nMarta gave birth to their fourth child, a boy, and the residents of Flight Controller Alley ganged up on Kranz to send him to her side while she was in labor.", "Kranz worked by feel and the mission came off reasonably well for the fact that they weren\u2019t really prepared for a power failure in the control center.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston adapted its electrical systems so that wouldn\u2019t happen in the future and camera crews were required to provide their own power when covering future space missions.\nTug Of War Even though everybody in NASA had the same goal of going to the Moon, there were frequent disagreements about how to get there and who was in charge of what.\nMission Control got into a tug-of-war with the astronaut office over who, exactly, was in charge of the remote stations.", "Carpenter was heard to comment, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d That made Llewellyn mad.\n\u201cThat SOB is lucky to be alive.\u201d From then on, whenever someone wanted to get Llewellyn to tell the story, all they had to do was repeat the line, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d Kranz felt that a combination of a distracted crewman, too many scientific experiments, and ground crew taking too long to remind him of checklists had almost cost them an astronaut.\nThey had gotten lucky, but Kranz wanted to eliminate luck as a factor in future space flights.\nIn any case, Carpenter would go on to participate in Sealab and never flew a space mission again.", "Like many of the Gemini controllers had been, some of the members of his team were fresh out of college and Llewellyn couldn\u2019t resist playing a joke on one of them.\nOne of the youngsters asked about a controller who had visited the coffee station ahead of them.\nLlewellyn retorted, \u201cSheeet, man, that\u2019s Captain Refsmmat, the ideal flight controller!\u201d Refsmmat was Trench shorthand for \u201creference to stable member

bear coming out hibernation, he was slow to wake up.", "Luckily, they had spares on hand and they were able to replace it with only a minor delay.\nWalt Williams kept one eye on the weather while they waited.\nWhen the hold was over, Williams started the poll of the controllers, spacecraft and test conductors.", "Then, Kraft was distracted by some issues with the worldwide data network and Kranz moved on.", "Gemini 4 splashed down on June 27 after a successful mission.\nMarta was happy that her white vest had gone over so well and Kranz had an idea that she could make a more flashy vest he could wear at the end of a mission to signal his team that they had done a good job.\nGemini-Titan 5 Kranz\u2019s team came up with a surprise for him in the form of an American flag he could keep in his office and bring down to Mission Control at the beginning of each mission.\nIt saw its first use on August 21, 1965, at the launch of Gemini-Titan 5, an eight-day mission set to beat Russia\u2019s endurance record and put the U.S. in the lead.\nThe crew was Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad.", "When he didn\u2019t show for White Team\u2019s next turn in the control room, Kranz had the previous shift\u2019s RETRO give him a call.\nLlewellyn raced to work and, without thinking of the possible consequences, drove his car across the lawn and up the stairs.\nPerhaps he thought he had found the perfect parking place at the building\u2019s main entrance, but security personnel weren\u2019t amused.\nLunney and Hodge had his parking pass suspended and told Kranz, \u201cLlewellyn has got to learn a lesson.\nHaving to walk on site will maybe put a dent in his thick skull.\u201d Kranz doubted it and Llewellyn proved him right when he showed up with his own horse the very next day.", "Kranz described the moment when he heard Shepard had entered his spacecraft as \u201csurreal.\u201d This was the moment they had all waited for since signing up.", "His team made use of a pneumatic tube system for sending messages to other controllers and computer operators.\nThe aluminum cylinders reminded him of his days as a Marine.\nHe exclaimed to nobody in particular, \u201cI think I am back in the trenches again with my fire control team, surrounded by empty 105 howitzer canisters!\u201d From then on, the Flight Dynamics team was referred to as \u201cThe Trench\u201d and it wasn\u2019t long before \u201cThe Trench\u201d matchbooks were circulating.\nIn the meantime, Llewellyn\u2019s team was busy working on orbit trajectory propagation.\nTheir job was to keep track of the spacecraft\u2019s orbit and forecast where it would be hours or days in the future.", "They would hold blindfold drills in which they reached for each switch until they could almost have flown the thing themselves.\nThe art of flight control was continuing to be refined and the control team spent many hours studying schematics and writing flight procedures and mission rules.\nKraft made one change in the job description of the flight director.\nThe description now said: \u201cThe flight director may, after analysis of a flight, take any action necessary for mission success.\u201d This cleared up some vague terms in the previous job description and gave the flight director more leeway in directing the missions.", "Brooks would throw every imaginable scenario at them to see how they handled it.\nOne time, the simulation supervisor (SimSup) decided Kraft was depending too much on Kranz and pulled him off.\n\u201cKranz had an accident on the way to MCC and is in the hospital,\u201d SimSup told Kraft.\nKranz protested, \u201cWhat are you doing?\nWe have a mission to prepare for!\u201d Kraft was amused.", "Problems developed in the thrusters and seat tests and Kraft dived into the task of insuring that the control team was ready for any contingency.\nHe was still the senior flight director and gave Kranz the authority to do the same with his team.\nKranz assured him that he was already on the job.\nThen, Kranz got his first real test in his new role of flight director when Kraft became practically bedridden with influenza six days before the launch.\nThe job of handling the final simulation, pad tests and pre-launch briefings fell on Kranz\u2019s lap.", "Bob Carlton, dubbed \u201cThe Silver Fox\u201d for his gray hair, became CONTROL, responsible for LM navigation, control and navigation systems.\nAmong other things, he would be responsible for keeping track of how much fuel remained on the LM.\nDon Puddy became TELMU, responsible for communications, power and life support systems.\nHe appointed himself leader of the lunar module team.\nSteve Bales became GUIDO, responsible for guidance systems.\nHe had the black round-rimmed glasses characteristic of his nature as a computer whiz, and had a habit of speaking rapidly.", "He left the hotel shortly after midnight, carpooling with MCC RETRO Carl Huss.", "His attitude could be abrasive and he didn\u2019t get along well with some of the flight directors.\nKranz thought he did fine as long as he was kept on a short leash.\nCharlie Duke joined the team as Kranz\u2019s CapCom.\nHe integrated with the team so well that Kranz thought that he would have made an excellent flight director.\nWhile establishing the mission rules, Bill Tindall livened things up with his Tindallgrams.\nA typical Tindallgram might read: \u201cThere is another thing about powered descent crew procedures that really bugged me.", "He backed down after the fifth day and the crew tried to make up for it by continuing the tradition of Schirra\u2019s humorous signs.\nKraft and Slayton broached the subject of keeping their helmets on during reentry and Schirra blew up.\nAs he later put it in a Sudafed commercial, \u201cHave you ever tried sneezing in one of these?\u201d On the one hand, keeping the helmets on would protect them if the cabin depressurized suddenly.\nOn the other, they still had the colds and risked ear blockage and possible hearing loss if they kept the helmets on.\nIt took some doing, but the flight directors did their best to keep their cool with the crew and keep their flight teams on track.", "As Carpenter began coming back into the atmosphere and they lost radio contact, all the people in the control room could do was pray.\nKranz had only felt this kind of helplessness when he held his wife\u2019s hand during childbirth.\nFinally, Grissom caught Carpenter\u2019s report that his chute had deployed and replied that they would get Air Rescue personnel to him within an hour.\nRescue personnel found an annoyed Carpenter munching on a candy bar.", "Would they be able to get enough telemetry data to make a decision on landing?\nKranz finally solved the issue by adding a mission rule: \u201cThe flight director will determine if sufficient data exists to continue the landing.\u201d This would insure that humans would make the final call where computers failed.\nBy July 5, the Apollo 11 crew had deployed to the Cape and the White Team was training with the Apollo 12 crew.\nThey had nailed six tough simulations, boosting their confidence.\nThe 12 prime crew switched places with their backup crew.\nThis would be the final simulation before Launch Day and Kranz\u2019s mind was already on the bits of business he had to take care of before the launch.", "They took numerous pictures, including this iconic image of the Earth rising over the moon.\nThe crew had been working for almost a full day by this point and Borman decided that the crew should get some rest before the trans-Earth injection burn that would put them on course for the return to Earth.\nKranz was observing from one of the consoles in the back of the room when Bill Anders revealed his Christmas Eve surprise.\nHe began reading the Creation story from the Book of Genesis.\nKranz, a Catholic, felt chills go down his spine as Jim Lovell and then Frank Borman picked up the story.\nWhat could possibly be more appropriate?", "There was a chance that Kranz would have to step into Kraft\u2019s place for the launch and he was so nervous that he clipped out a Sports Illustrated picture of a woman in a swimsuit for emotional support.\nKraft recovered enough to cover the actual launch and Kranz stepped back to his original role of insuring that the control teams and data network were ready.\nIt was one of the few unmanned shots covered by reporters in the control room and Kranz thought it was a bit much for an unmanned suborbital shot that had become nearly routine in the Mercury days.\nThere were so many cameras in the room that a fuse blew, plunging them into darkness.\nThis was where blindfold drills came in handy.", "They had only one pause to fix a glitch in the erector holding the rocket in a vertical position.\nGemini 4 launched at 10:15:59 am on June 3, 1965.\nWhen the Titan burned itself out, McDivitt separated the Gemini from the Titan booster on schedule.\nHe turned the Gemini around and accelerated toward the spent booster.\nA few minutes later, he reported that the booster was moving away from the Gemini in a lower orbit.\nIt was a quick lesson in orbital mechanics.\nBy accelerating toward the Titan, McDivitt had boosted the Gemini into a higher orbit and lost ground speed.", "Many of these new people were brand-new graduates from colleges around Texas.\nA basic training course for flight controllers was set up.\nThe first class of six spent two weeksworth of twelve-hour days learning learning Morse code and speed printing.\nKranz handed out their flight controllerscertificates himself, and then the first class went out to the remote sites.\nA few of the controllers posted in unfriendly territories like Zanzibar had military experience that served them well when they ran across such obstacles as burning roadblocks and hostile natives.", "He and Stafford kept rattling off numbers.\nThe ground crew moved swiftly through the launch kill procedures.\nThe Titan\u2019s systems detected that launch hadn\u2019t occurred and engines shut down automatically.\nInspections revealed that an umbilical had released prematurely and a dust cover also hadn\u2019t been removed.\nSome people may have thought of \u201cThe Four-Inch Flight,\u201d in which a power cord had also caused a premature shutdown by disconnecting early.\nOnce again, they were lucky.", "They would have to come back home.\nHodge\u2019s Blue Team had been on duty for eleven hours and was exhausted, so Hodge asked Kranz to take

abort and spend time floating in the western Pacific Ocean but started the reentry procedures.\nGemini 8 lasted only ten hours and forty-one minutes but the rookie Agena team got two more days to

from there.\nIt got so bad that Chris Kraft gave Kranz a call.\n\u201cI listened to your runs today.\nSounds like you had a tough time.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kranz assured his boss that his team was only having a bad day and would get through it with more training and revisions of the mission rules.\nThings did improve for a while.\nA readiness review on June 17 revealed only one issue that sparked a debate that would last until the week before the launch.\nChris Kraft brought up the issue of landing data rules.\nMost controllers had made a bad call based on faulty telemetry data at some point during training.", "The command was sent up and Kranz heard the welcome news from Carlton: \u201cFire-in-the-hole, abort stage, we are stable!\u201d Their struggles with the commands had done some damage to the LM but they accomplished all the important objectives.\nBecause of their success, newspapers were able to report the happy news: \u201cApollo Mission A Success, Lunar Program On Track!\u201d Apollo 6 was less than successful due to failed rocket engines.\nIn August 1968, Flight Control Division chief John Hodge was abruptly transferred out to study post-Apollo options, leaving Kranz in charge.", "Things went smoothly at first, with Cooper ticking off his experiments on schedule and the shift change occurring on schedule as Faith 7 was progressing along its sixth orbit.\nHodge had a different approach to mission control than Kraft did.\nKraft was a very hands-on mentor of the young mission controllers and comfortable with his status as team leader.\nHodge tried to obtain a consensus before making a decision, was good with people but didn\u2019t seem quite so comfortable with his leadership role.\nKranz remembered him as a nice guy.", "Coupled with an accelerating schedule, he would compare it to \u201cjuggling grenades.\u201d They were about to get rolling with manned flight again, with Wally Schirra in command of Apollo 7.\nIt would turn into a battle of wills.\nApollo 7 October 11-22, 1968 Apollo 7 was to be a simple shakedown of the command and service module.\nIt would also be the first three-man crew with Wally Schirra, Walter Cunningham

Charlie Harlan and CapCom C.C.\nWilliams.\nThe other was in the Gemini, located where Wally Schirra could grab and yank it.\nHarlan had exactly two worries at this point.\nNobody particularly liked the Gemini ejection system, so he did not want to call an abort when one wasn\u2019t necessary.\nNeither did he want to call an abort too late and risk losing a crew in a fireball.\nThe clock reached zero and the engines lit with the usual rumble intense enough to be felt inside the Gemini.\nThen, everything went quiet.", "Cooper made some celestial observations and took several pictures of Earth and celestial objects during a quiet period in his schedule, and then set a milestone of his own when he became the first American to sleep in orbit.\nHis heart rate dropped low enough to alarm the physicians, who had CapCom wake him briefly to make certain he was okay.\nThe team fell into a mode of relaxed alertness and kept an eye on things until Kraft\u2019s team came back on duty.", "Glenn was troubleshooting some attitude control problems while Mission Control tried to make sense of the data they were getting from the remote sites.\nOnly about half those sites were seeing the Segment 51.\nSome of the design techs suggested making sure the landing bag switch was off and asking Glenn whether he had heard any banging noises when he maneuvered.", "Hodge started the meeting with a briefing that included the information they knew so far.\nThen, Kranz took the podium.\nHe had gone from shock to anger and wanted to say something that would snap the people out of their own shock.\nHe had not planned a speech, but the words seemed to flow naturally anyway.\n\u201cSpaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity and neglect.\nSomewhere, somehow, we screwed up.\nIt could have been in design, build or test.\nWhatever it was, we should have caught it.\n\u201cWe were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw in each day of our work.", "Stafford was the quiet one of the two and generally kept his opinions to himself.\nTheir first launch attempt on May 17, 1966 was a bust when the curse of the Agena struck again and pieces of it fell into the Atlantic Ocean.\nSo they pulled out a new backup rendezvous vehicle called the augmented target docking adopter (ATDA), the mission was renamed Gemini 9A for the sake of bureaucracy and they scheduled the next launch attempt for June 1.\nThe ATDA launch went well but the controller for this new automated spacecraft reported that it was guzzling fuel and the adapter shroud might not have opened fully.\nA command shut down the ATDA\u2019s attitude control jets.", "A new influx of college graduates were brought in to maintain the new technology and bring the control team up to speed.\nKranz had only limited experience with computers and had to scramble to catch up.\nThe residents of Flight Controller Alley spent almost two years preparing for the first Gemini launch and became a close-knit bunch in the process.\nOne of Kranz\u2019s contribution was a mock-up of a Gemini cockpit.\nHe wanted his team to become nearly as familiar with the spacecraft\u2019s controls as the astronauts would be.", "Mission Control and the remote sites used timed-tagged stored program commands (SPC) to control the unmanned Agena.\nBecause the Agena spacecraft had given them so many problems, nobody was taking any chances that it might misinterpret a command and go wild.\nThe Agena had an error checking routine that helped controllers verify that the command being put in the onboard computer\u2019s memory was the one they had sent.\nAs a backup, the remote site computers performed an echo check by automatically recording each command as it was converted into radio waves and checking it with the intended command load.", "Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White and Chaffee.\nThese words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.\u201d The official investigation would reveal that the fire had started somewhere near Gus Grissom\u2019s seat.\nThere was some speculation that Grissom could have done something to cause the fire, which the controllers and engineers who were most involved in the project thought was pure nonsense.\nThe fire had started in an area that Grissom couldn\u2019t reach from his seat, even by accident.", "During the post-mission debriefing, Kranz got up on the stage and gave a speech about discipline and control.\nThinking back on it years later, Kranz conceded that

had scored another space first with an EVA by cosmonaut Aleksei Leonov.\nIt seemed like the U.S. couldn\u2019t score a space first for anything and Chris Kraft seemed distracted when Kranz delivered a report on the Gemini 3 mission to his office.\nWhen Kranz finished giving a verbal summary, Kraft walked across his office and closed the door.", "The people on the ground concurred and recommended resetting the gyros.\nThis didn\u2019t help, and Carpenter ended up wasting a lot of fuel trying to correct until they suggested that he simply coast until he was ready to start the reentry sequence.\nAs Aurora 7 went into the final orbit, it became obvious that Carpenter would have to make a manual reentry.\nThe Capcom at the Hawaiian station talked him through the checklist for retrofire.\nIn the meantime, he was still having trouble with the temperature on his pressure suit and, by the end of his third orbit, was starting to show signs of overheating.\nAt one point, Chris Kraft snapped to Gus Grissom at CapCom, \u201cDammit, Gus, keep him on task.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of this, but I\u2019m showing an indication of Segment 51.\u201d This was more serious than the President\u2019s phone call.\nSegment 51 was the impact bag deploy.\nIf that had somehow come undone, the heat shield was loose and John Glenn would burn up when he reentered the atmosphere.\nAs they tried to track down the indication, the chief audio technician had the unfortunate duty of telling the president, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten pretty busy down here!\u201d The president answered, \u201cGive me a call when you get the chance.\u201d Some of the readouts suggested that the Segment 51 was a false alarm, but they couldn\u2019t be certain.", "The ground crew went through an efficient turnaround and they were ready for the next launch window just three days later.\nLaunch!\nGemini 6 had given them so many problems that it was almost a letdown when it finally launched without a hiccup on December 15, 1965.\nThe rendezvous maneuvers went smoothly and Gemini 6 caught up with Gemini 7 six hours after launch.\nWhen the White Team took over the control room, they had little time to celebrate but the 6 crew certainly found time for a few jokes.", "If the telemetry from the Agena\u2019s error checking routine failed, controllers could perform a manual check that would take several hours or save time by basing their decisions on the echo check.\nGemini 8 was only half an orbit from rendezvousing with the Agena when the CapCom on Rose Knot reported that they had lost the automatic data comparison on the Agena.\nThe Agena systems engineer tried to rerun it, and then began printing out the memory data for the manual check.\nThe echo check looked okay, so Gemini 8 approached the Agena as planned, Rose Knot gave everything one last check, and the controllers gave the Go for docking.", "Kranz would have preferred the chance to brief remote site teams before the flight but was told, \u201cNo briefings.\u201d The remote site CapComs were given sealed envelopes that would only be opened if given specific instructions from Kranz.\nThey contained only a brief note addressing the EVA, plus a planned rendezvous with the booster after separation.\nKranz prepared for his Gemini 4 flight director duties during the day and worked on the EVA at night.\nThe EVA ground team reviewed footage of Leonov\u2019s spacewalk and inspected hardware being developed for White\u2019s EVA with the goal of having everything ready two weeks before the scheduled launch date.", "To catch the booster, he would have had to drop into a lower orbit and gain ground speed.\nThat was counterintuitive to a pilot used to the idea that he had to accelerate toward the object he wanted to rendezvous with.\nAfter another attempt to rendezvous with the booster, Kraft decided that they should give it up.\nIn the meantime, Ed White was preparing for his EVA.\nThis would mean exposing the entire interior of the spacecraft to vacuum.\nThere would be nothing between the astronauts and instant death but their thin space suits and helmets.\nThe team decided to give him an extra orbit to get through his checklist.\nNo one knew what to expect.", "It was only partly open and held in place by a band.\n\u201cIt looks like an angry alligator,\u201d reported Stafford.\nMission Control sent several rapid maneuver commands in an attempt to jettison the shroud with no luck.\nIn the meantime, the Gemini left the Agena, orbited Earth one more time, and returned for a second rendezvous.\nA brainstorming session by the ATDA team failed to come up with any workable ideas.\nStafford suggested using the nose of the Gemini to nudge the shroud off and Kranz was quick to veto that idea.\nFor the time being, Kranz\u2019s team gave up on trying to get the shroud off.", "To be on the safe side, Kraft had recovery teams redeployed to emergency landing areas.\nThe White Team began to move into place to back up Kraft\u2019s Red Team.\nThe fuel cell situation began to stabilize, but it was obvious that they weren\u2019t able to operate at full power and some of the experiments were canceled.\nKraft wanted to go for a full day and began preparing for the handover.\nKranz expected a normal handover routine in which they would go over any outstanding issues.\nKraft was eager to get to the press conference and abruptly put his headset away.\nKranz didn\u2019t know if he had a plan.\n\u201cChris, what do you want to do?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the flight director; it\u2019s your shift.", "Training started eight weeks before the planned launch date.\nThey ran through the planned mission for the first couple of days to identify major Go/NoGo points and get a feel for what a \u201cnormal\u201d mission with no problems would be.\nA new SimSup named Dick Koos continued the tradition of imaginative simulation scripts that helped the control team refine procedures and mission rules.\nNot everything went perfectly.\nThe crew and controllers often trained together and that meant the computer network between the control room and crew simulators needed to stay up and running.\nWhen it didn\u2019t, SimSup had to contend with impatient astronauts and controllers while technicians tried to troubleshoot.", "Just call me \u2018Aunt Emma\u2019; certainly some smart people may laugh at my concern, but I just feel that the crew should not be diddling around with the computer keyboard during powered descent unless absolutely necessary.\nThey will never hit a wrong button, of course, but if they do, the results can be really lousy.\u201d Many of his Tindallgram ideas were incorporated into the mission rules, including changing the Go/NoGo decisions to Stay/NoStay for actual lunar activity.\nFor his efforts, Bill Tindall became an honorary flight director with Gray as a team color and Kranz invited Tindall to sit beside him for the lunar landing.", "Even so, it took its toll and Lunney vented his frustration to Kranz during the last handover, \u201cI have finally had enough of this crew.\u201d Schirra got his way on the helmet issue and his crew made it down on schedule.\nIt was Schirra\u2019s third and last space flight and Eisele and Cunningham never flew in space again.\nLunney received a well-deserved medal for his efforts.\nKranz never found out why Schirra had been so bad-tempered and, after leaving NASA, Schirra went back to his normal funny self.\nApollo 8 December 21-27, 1968 Apollo 8 gave the trajectory people some interesting problems to figure out.\nMany of them remembered the complexity of rendezvous during Gemini and that was in Earth orbit.", "Gemini 5 splashed down with a duration record under their belts and Mission Control began to look ahead to their first attempt at rendezvous and docking.\nThe planned star of the show was an automated spacecraft called Agena.\nSome of the MCC controllers were less than impressed, especially after one ground test in which faulty software sent every available command to the Agena.\nIf this had happened during an actual mission, they would have been in big trouble.\nTheir disparaging comments would turn out to be accurate.\nGemini 6 October 25, 1965 looked like a beautiful morning for the planned double launch.\nThe Agena would go up first to set up the conditions of the rendezvous.", "Kranz enjoyed the early-morning silence and the searchlights in the distance assured him that the countdown was still running.\nEverything was on schedule when he arrived.\nKranz checked out communications on his and Kraft\u2019s console.\nKraft greeted him with his usual, \u201cHow\u2019s it going, young man?\u201d and Kranz responded with a thumbs-up.", "During the nineteenth orbit, Cooper\u2019s05 G indicator came on.\nThis would have meant that he had started reentry, but Cooper believed it was a false reading and disabled the fuses leading to it.\nThis disabled an automatic system that would have been used for retrofire.\nCooper would have to fire the retro rockets manually.\nKranz made sure the new plans went out to the remote stations and set up backup communications with John Glenn, the capcom on the Coastal Sentry.\nIt may have occurred to the control team that part of the reason Scott Carpenter had landed so far out of the planned recovery area was that he had fired the retros a few seconds late, but that was the biggest concern.", "Kranz explained to the top players in the room that there was a lot of energy stored up in the shroud\u2019s release mechanism and Cernan would have nothing to latch onto while he worked.\nNewtonian physics applied while in orbit and just using a screwdriver could send him spinning if he had nothing to hold onto.\nIf that thing came off with Cernan nearby, they stood a chance of losing one astronaut.\nNASA didn\u2019t need that kind of poor publicity.\nHe was overridden and, even worse, Chris Kraft had done nothing to back him up.\nFurious, Kranz threatened to quit after the mission was over.", "They wanted to save the EVA for the next day.\nConsidering the circumstances, this was the equivalent of canceling it altogether.\nCapCom looked to Kranz for direction and a relieved Kranz gave him a thumbs-up.\n\u201cFlight concurs.\u201d Kranz had recently been offered a chance to return to test flight and would likely have done so if they had gone ahead with the plan to release the shroud.\nHe had dodged a bullet.\nCernan went on to make the planned EVA.\nEven without going over to the Agena, it was a surprisingly tough job and he wore himself out just getting to the backpack stowed in a compartment outside the Gemini.\nHe was drenched with sweat and the evaporation fogged up his visor, blinding him.", "When they tried to retrieve their LM from the compartment on the Saturn, some of the thrusters weren\u2019t working.\nThe culprit was a switch that had been accidentally bumped.\nSwitch covers would be included in the future.\nA few hours later, the Spider finally came out of the compartment.\nFor such a fragile spacecraft, the Spider held up well to the repeated firings of the Gumdrop\u2018s main engine over the next few days.\nThey were just getting ready to power up the Spider for testing when McDivitt sprang an unpleasant surprise on them.\nSchweickart had been space sick for days and might not be able to perform a planned spacewalk that would have taken him from the lunar module to the command module.", "The Apollo Program The Apollo Program was America\u2019s final push in the race to the Moon.\nIt would produce nationally and internationally recognized names like Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and many more.\nApollo Chris Kraft had been promoted to chief of the Flight Operations Directorate and gotten so busy with his new duties that he was no longer an active flight director.\nGene Kranz had been promoted to the deputy of the Flight Control Division and decided to only direct the odd-numbered Apollo flights.\nThough he didn\u2019t realize it at the time, this put him directly in line to be a flight director for the first lunar landing.", "\u201cWe got our crew home safely and the control teams did a damn fine job under real-time pressure.\nI know this is going to sound like Monday morning quarterbacking, but the lessons from the mission are how we screwed up in planning and training.\n\u201cThe crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong.\nWe failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked, they must be considered as one spacecraft, one integrated power system, and a single structure.\n\u201cThe next thing is that many of us did not trust the Agena.\nBrooks\u2019s team thought it was a great piece of hardware.\nIf we don\u2019t trust a spacecraft, we have to fix it.", "I think he\u2019s delirious.\u201d Though California gave him the countdown for firing the retro-rockets, Carpenter hit the button three seconds too late.\nHe was going to land somewhere past the planned landing area.\nIt was questionable whether he could even get into the proper attitude for reentry and he would have to use the fly-by-wire system to keep his spacecraft from tumbling.\nLlewellyn resorted to high school geometry to determine that Carpenter was going to land at least 200 miles long.", "Since Alan Shepard\u2019s flight, it had become traditional to assign astronauts in the role of Capsule Communicator, the one who would have direct contact with the spacecraft in flight, both in Houston and at the remote sites.\nThough Deke Slayton had been forced into a purely administrative role after being grounded, he was still an astronaut at heart and believed that only astronauts could handle the time-sensitive decision making and communications involved in the role.\nHis belief was shared by Alan Shepard, who was similarly grounded with a debilitating ear condition and worked closely with Slayton.\nMost of the astronauts who were actually sent out to those sites felt the same.", "Jose Jimenez.", "But, as it turned out, the launch pad crew were piping it into Shepard\u2019s spacecraft in an attempt to get him to lighten up.\nIt certainly added to the surreal feeling and got grins from a few people in Mission Control.", "For an instant, Harlan wondered if they were having a repeat of \u201cKaputnik,\u201d an early American answer to Sputnik that had been lost in a launchpad explosion, with two crewmen inside.\nThen, he checked his readouts.\n\u201cNo liftoff!\u201d he told the flight director over the communications loop.\nIn the Gemini, nobody would have particularly blamed Wally Schirra if he had activated the ejection system.\nHowever, he was cool as a cucumber and realized that it would have been the wrong move.\nHe would comment later that having been through a launch once before helped.\nHe knew what liftoff felt like and knew by the lack of rising G-forces that they were still on the launchpad.", "Kranz thought of him as his main competitor.\nCharlesworth had a background in Army ordnance labs and earned the nickname \u201cThe Mississipi Gambler\u201d for his laid-back personality.\nBoth had been part of the trajectory team.\nThey had only two months to prepare for Gemini 9 and Kranz was forced to make an unpopular move.\nHe declared that there would be no holidays or vacations.\nSome of the controllerswives were quite annoyed and let him know about it.\nHe stuck to his guns and explained that astronautslives were on the line every time they sat on top of one of those rockets.\nDuring a launch, controllers had to be capable of making split-second decisions.", "When he found out the truth, he chalked it up to the fact that if you asked enough experts, you would eventually find one nay-sayer.\nSlayton took charge of the astronaut corps, an important job that must have felt like a consolation prize.\nCarpenter swung right into preparations and named his spacecraft the Aurora 7.\nThe flight date was changed to give him more time for training.\nThe Friendship 7 had proven the value of having a man in control of the spacecraft and they hoped to expand on it with Aurora 7.", "\u201cI hope you\u2019re ready as a flight director for Gemini 4 because there\u2019s a job I want you to do for me.\u201d Gemini 4 was already a packed four-day mission and NASA chiefs had decided to add an EVA by Ed White.\nKraft wanted Kranz to work with the Crew Systems Division on planned altitude chamber tests and put together the mission rules and data packet for America\u2019s first spacewalk.\nKraft was pacing.\n\u201cThis is risky, but I think it\u2019s worth a shot at getting a spacewalk on [Gemini 4 mission commander] McDivitt\u2019s mission.\u201d Making the job even more difficult, Ed White knew about the possible EVA before most of Mission Control did.", "They think the crew is dead!\u201d Kranz turned on the TV to see what the reporters had found out so far.\nIt wasn\u2019t much.\nChris Kraft had acted quickly to lock down Mission Control so they could investigate.\nEnvisioning explosions and an inferno that consumed the entire pad, he rushed to the Center and had trouble finding a parking space.\nEvery available controller was reporting in to see what they could do to help.\nThe controllers still in the control room were too stunned to say much.\nThose still capable of focusing were going over data at their stations.\nMost of the rest were milling around, trying to make sense of the tragedy.", "The mission was meant to test the Lunar Module in Earth orbit and was scheduled to launch in two months.\nThey had gotten behind on preparations and, during one simulation, Gene Kranz proved that not even the flight director was immune to mistakes when he called an abort too late and sim-killed the crew by landing them in a mountainous area of Africa.\nIt was an embarrassing mistake but a good reminder not to get too relaxed during a mission.\nThe mission commander was James McDivitt with Dave Scott as the command module pilot and Russell \u201cRusty\u201d Schweickart as the lunar module pilot.\nThe crew came up with the names of Gumdrop for the CSM and Spider for the LM.", "The Americans scored their second space first when Armstrong reported, \u201cWe\u2019re docked, no noticeable oscillations, very smooth.\u201d Everything seemed to be going well, though CapCom Jim Lovell decided that Armstrong and Scott should be informed of the failed load comparison.\nA military coup in Zanzibar had forced NASA to move the remote station over to Madagascar and Gemini 8 was making a pass over it when Lovell told them, \u201cIf the Agena attitude control system goes wild, just send the command to turn it off and take control of the spacecraft.\u201d Everything looked normal when Gemini 8 flew into a zone of no coverage.", "To allow for limited private communications, Mission Control worked out a workaround code called UHF-6.\nIf either the ground or the crew requested a UHF-6 test, a private loop would be set up with a surgeon in the back room and the surgeon would privately brief the flight director afterwards.\nThe press was typically nosy, however, and Kranz tried to give them a runaround with highly technical jargon about communications and antenna.\nThat failed and he was forced to admit defeat.\nWith the Gemini 6 launch coming up, all the controllers were pulling exhausting double shifts.\nLlewellyn got himself into trouble when he went home to sleep.", "The Gemini Twins On the outside, Gemini looked like a bigger version of the Mercury capsules.\nOn the inside, many of the systems had been streamlined.\nThe interior allowed more space for the \u201ctwins,\u201d two astronauts, who would be riding it, but would still be cramped.\nGemini would make use of fuel cells and cyrogenics, storable propellants, and a rudimentary computer.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center was also being redesigned to make use of computers.\nDigital systems were also being installed at the remote tracking stations and the data network was upgraded to transmit data at 2.4 kilobits per second, which was considered high-speed at the time.", "Scott Carpenter had just started his thirty-day Sealab mission and Llewellyn hadn\u2019t forgotten his line, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d Kranz recruited FIDO, RETRO and CapCom as co-conspirators and told them that he wanted to convince Llewellyn that the countdown for the retrofire would come from Sealab.\nLlewellyn came into Mission Control to start his shift and FIDO pretended to be so focused on his job that he didn\u2019t even respond to Llewellyn\u2019s greeting.\nSo he asked RETRO what was going on and RETRO answered, \u201cIt\u2019s this dad-blamed test from Sealab.\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Llewellyn got curious and asked Kranz.", "Borman closed it out with, \u201cAnd from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you \u2013 all of you on the planet Earth.\u201d As the crew settled into a route back to Earth, some of the controllers kidded about the possibility of actually hitting the carrier assigned to retrieve the crew during the final reentry phase.\nThe guidance system had improved that much.\nLuckily, that didn\u2019t happen and the Apollo 8 crew had a successful splashdown on December 27, 1968.\nApollo 9 With the successful completion of Apollo 8, Kranz\u2019s team jumped right into preparations for Apollo 9.", "We were lucky, too damned lucky, and we must never forget this mission\u2019s lessons.\u201d They were all lessons that would serve them well during the Apollo 13 crisis.\nFor the moment, they made the necessary changes and went forward into preparations for Gemini 9.\nIt would be Gene Kranz\u2019s last Gemini mission before he moved over to the Apollo project.\nThe Angry Alligator With John Hodge moving over to Apollo, Gene Kranz was the only one of the original three flight directors left in Gemini.\nGlynn Lunney and Cliff Charlesworth were promoted to fill the role.\nLunney was the youngest
