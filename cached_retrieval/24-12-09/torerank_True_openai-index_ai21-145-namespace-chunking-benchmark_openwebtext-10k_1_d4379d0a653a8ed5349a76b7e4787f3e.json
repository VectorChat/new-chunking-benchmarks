["So how often does Alice have to 4-bet?\nThis follows from the pot odds Bob is getting on his 3-bet bluffs.\nThere's 1.5 + 3.5 =5bb in the pot from the blinds and Alice's raise, and Bob 3-bets to 12bb to win this.\nBob is then risking 12bb to win 5bb, and he's getting effective pot odds 5 : 12 on a 3-bet bluff.\nHe then needs to win more than 12/(5 + 12) =70% to have a profitable bluff.\nSo if Alice folds more than 70%, Bob will have an automatic profit by 3-bet bluffing any two.\nAlice needs to prevent this, so she has to 4-bet enough to make Bob's bluffs break even.\nAlice's optimal 4-betting strategy is therefore to 4-bet 30% of her opening range, and she will 4-bet a mix of value hands (planning to call a 5-bet) and bluffs (planing to fold to a 5-bet).", "- She needs to 4-bet 30% of her opening range Her 4-betting range should have a 60/40 value/bluff ratio So Alice's optimal strategy is: Alice open-raises some opening range When she gets 3-bet, she 4-bets 30% of her opening range with a 60/40 ratio between value 4-bets and bluff 4-bets Alice therefore 4-bets 0.60 x 30 =18% of her opening range for value and 0.40 x 30 =12% of her opening range as a bluff If Bob 5-bets all-in, Alice calls with all her value hands, and folds all her 4-bet bluffs So Alice's value hands are the top 18% of her opening range.", "The effective pot odds for Alice's 4-bet bluffs are 17 : 23.5, and she can make a profit by 4-bet bluffing any two (of the hands she open-raised) if Bob folds his 3-betting hands more than 23.5/(23.5 + 17) =58%.\nBob can't allow Alice to 4-bet bluff any two cards profitably, so he defends optimally by folding exactly 58% of the time, and 5-betting all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs as we shall soon see) 42% of the time.\nTherefore, 42% of Bob's 3-bets need to be value hands that he plans to 5-bet all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs).", "So Alice's 4-betting range has to contain 60% value hands and 40% bluff hands.\nNow we know everything we

find Bob's optimal ranges for 3-betting and 5-betting.\nThese ranges follow from Alice's opening range: When Alice 4-bets to 27bb, she is risking 23.5bb (27bb minus he 3.5bb raise) more to win a 17bb pot (1.5bb from the blinds + Alice's 3.5bb raise + Bob's 12bb 3-bet).", "But note that a hand like AQ works as a blocker against Bob's premium hands (AA, AK, QQ).\nSo when Alice uses AQ as a bluff, it will be less likely that Bob has a hand he can 5-bet for value.\nKeep this in mind if you are choosing specific hands to always use for 4-bet bluffing.\nDefining a 4-bet bluff range using the percentage method My preferred method, and also the easiest method to remember.\nWe only need to remember one number, namely the static percentage Alice 4-bet bluffs her non-value hands.\nLet's find this percentage once and for all: Alice 4-bets 18% of her opening range for value, and she's left with 82% non-value hands she can use for 4-bet bluffing.", "There's 1.5 + 3.5 =5bb in the pot from the

the blinds + Alice's 3.5bb raise + Bob's 12bb 3-bet).\nThe effective pot odds for Alice's 4-bet bluffs are 17 : 23.5, and she can make a profit by 4-bet bluffing any two (of the hands she open-raised)

bluff.Alice then 4-bets 18% of the 186 combos for value, e.g.\n0.18 x 186 =33 value combos.\nThis corresponds almost exactly to the value range {QQ+, AK} =34 combos (a couple of combos too many or too

Alice's total optimal strategy below, but first we'll find out how often Bob should 3-bet.We know which type of hands Bob should 5-bet bluff (Axs), and we know he should use a 40/60 value/bluff ratio (which, coincidentally is the opposite of the ratio for Alice's 4-bet range).\nThe last piece of information we need is Bob's3-bet percentage in an optimal 3-betting strategy.", "We now want:So we

this percentage to obtain a 60/40 value bluff ratio for her 4-bets.Let's double-check to see that this works the way it should:When Alice has raised some opening range and gotten 3-bet, we have deduced that her optimal value 4-bet range is 18% of her total range.", "The pot size before Bob's 5-bet is 40.5bb (1.5 from the blinds, + 27 from Alice's 4-bet + 12 from Bob's 3-bet).\nSo Bob is effectively risking 28bb to win 40.5bb when he is 5-bet bluffing.\nThe effective pot odds are 40.5 : 28, and Bob needs to win at least 28/(28 + 40.5) =40% to profit from 5-bet bluffing any two (or more precisely, any Axs hand, since we base our calculations on having ~30% equity when called).For Alice, this means she has to call a 5-bet 60% of the time to prevent Bob from making a profit by 5-betting any two.\nSo Alice's 4-betting range has to contain 60% value hands and 40% bluff hands.", "We find the answer by observing that Bob should 5-bet bluff enough to make Alice's weakest value hands break even.\nHe he bluffs more, Alice can gain by calling with more hands, and then Bob's strategy can't be optimal.\nAnd if he bluffs less, Alice can gain by folding more hands, and Bob's strategy can't be optimal in this case either.How many Axs hands we need to make Alice's weakest 5-bet calling hands break even varies with Alice's value range (60% of 30% of her opening range), which follows from her opening range.\nSo we have to compute this result on a per-case basis, for every one of Alice's opening ranges.", "Bob knows Alice's opening range.\nNot necessarily all the hands in the range, but he knows the percentage of hands Alice opens Both Alice and Bob are trying to play perfectly, under the assumption that their opponent is also trying to play perfectly The worst hands in a bluffing range or calling range should be break even The last statement needs an explanation: When we're 3-betting/4-betting/5-betting as a bluff, we should not lose money on our bluffing hands, and the worst of them should be no worse than break even.\nThe same goes for when we're calling for pot odds.\nThis makes sense if you think about it.\nWhen we're making a play that loses money, we should stop doing it to increase our EV.", "Let's compute the number to use against Alice's EP range: To effectively have 30 bluff combos from the candidate list in our 3-betting range, we need to use each of them 30/152 =20% of the time.\nNote that this percentage isn't universal, like Alice's fixed 4-bet bluff percentage (15%) is for all her opening ranges.\nTo see this, note that Bob's value range varies with Alice's opening range, but the candidate list of 3-bet bluff hands is static (we have simply chosen some hands to use).\nSo Bob will have to calculate a new bluff% to use for his candidate list against each of Alice's opening ranges.\nHowever, this isn't a big job, we simply do the math once and for all against each of Alice's ranges and memorize the numbers we need (and we'll look at Alice's CO range in a minute).\nSo, finally: Bob's optimal 3-bet strategy against Alice's optimal raising strategy in EP {Bob's total 3-bet range} ={value hands and 5-bet-bluff hands} + {3-bet bluff hands} ={KK+, A5s, A4s} + 20% x {A9s-A6s,ATo-A8o,K9s-K6s,KJo-K9o,Q9s-Q6s,QJo-Q9o} Bob always 3-bets {KK+, A5s, A4s} and 5-bets all-in after a 4-bet.\nIf he has one of the 152 combos from his candidate list for 3-bet bluffing, he uses a randomizer and 3-bet bluffs 20% of the time, and he folds to a 4-bet.\nWe had to do a bit of work to construct all these ranges, but it was worth it, and we have learned a lot in the process.\nLet's see what Bob's optimal total 3-bet% is in this case: Value part: 20 combos (1.5% of all hands) Bluff part: Effectively 20% of 152 =30 combos (2.3% of all hands) This results in a total 3-bet% of 1.5 + 2.3 =3.8% against Alice's ~15% EP raises.\nHis value/bluff ratio is the desired optimal 20/30 =40/60.\nLater, when we construct an optimal strategy against Alice's 25% CO range, we'll see that Bob's 3-bet% skyrockets as a consequence of Alice raising a much wider opening range.\nNote that the combination of a candidate list of 3-bet bluff hands and a fixed (but adjustable) bluff% to use with these hands, gives us a lot of flexibility to adjust our 3-bet bluffing as we please.\nAgainst an unknown opponent, we can start with the optimal 20% frequency, and 3-bet {KK+, A5s, A4s} always, and the candidate list 20% of the time.\nBut if we note that the raiser doesn't defend optimally, we might want to adjust this bluff percentage.\nFor example, of the raiser never 4-bet bluffs and only 4-bets a tight value range like {QQ+, AK}, we can go bananas with our 3-bet bluffs.\nWe might decide to double the bluff frequency from 20% to 40% for our list of 152 bluff candidate combos.\nNow we have 20 value combos, and effectively 0.40 x 152 =61 bluff combos.\nThis means 20/(20 + 61) =25% of our 3-bets are for value, and 75% are bluffs.\nOur first adjustment to exploit this particular opponent is therefore to lower the optimal value/bluff ratio from the optimal 40/ to the more exploitative 25/75.\nThen we can also drop 5-bet-bluffing against this tight player, as discussed previously.\nThe simplest adjustment is to keep 3-betting our 5-bet bluffing hands A5s/A4s, but we move them from the value range down to the 3-bet bluff range, and fold them to a 4-bet.\nThe only hands we 5-bet against this player and his {QQ+, AK} 4-bet range is {KK+}, purely for value.", "Let's double-check to see that this works the way it should: When Alice has raised some opening range and gotten 3-bet, we have deduced that her optimal value 4-bet range is 18% of her total range.\nIf she 4-bets the remaining 82% of her range as a bluff 15% of the time, her overall bluff percentage will be 0.15 x 0.82 =0.12 =12%.\nSo her total 4-bet range is he optimal 18 + 12 =30%, with a 18/12 =60/40 value/bluff ration.\nSo the percentages add up perfectly.\nAlice's optimal raise/4-bet/call 5-bet strategy in EP We now have everything we need to specify Alice's total strategy after a 15% open-raise.", "Bob can't allow Alice to 4-bet bluff any two cards profitably, so he defends optimally by folding exactly 58% of the time, and 5-betting all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs as we shall soon see) 42% of the time.\nTherefore, 42% of Bob's 3-bets need to be value hands that he plans to 5-bet all-in (including some 5-bet bluffs).\nWe now define a 3-bet for value as a 3-bet where we plan to 5-bet all-in after a 4-bet.", "And if he bluffs less, Alice can gain by folding more hands, and Bob's strategy can't be optimal in this case either.\nHow many Axs hands we need to make Alice's weakest 5-bet calling hands break even varies

illustrate randomized 4-bet bluffing in practice with an example: Example 3.1.1: Randomized 4-bet bluffing in EP $100NL 6-handed Alice ($100) raises pot to $3.50 with Alice does not have one of her value hands {QQ+, AK}, so she knows that this is a 4-bet-bluff-or-fold scenario.", "Against Alice's ~15% EP range this means flatting with hands like QQ, JJ, TT, AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, etc.\nSo when we pick hands for Bob's 3-bluffing range, we drop down to the \"cellar\" and pick hands that aren't god enough to 3-bet for value preflop, and not good enough to flat for postflop value.\nAgainst Alice, who either 4-bets or folds, it doesn't matter which hands we choose to 3-bet bluff with, since these hands will never see a flop.", "Bob starts by finding which hands he can 3-bet for value, planning to

(type Axs), and he will have a wide range of 3-bet bluffs that he folds to a 4-bet.\nWe'll now find Bob's 5-bet bluffing hands, then his 3-bet bluffing range, and then we are done.", "We include 5-bet bluffs in Bob's value range.\nRemember the definition of \"value range\" as the hands we 3-bet, planning to 5-bet all-in after a 4-bet.\nSome of these hands will be 5-bet bluffs, but for simplicity

find out how often Bob should 3-bet.\nWe know which type of hands Bob should 5-bet bluff (Axs), and we know he should use a 40/60 value/bluff ratio (which, coincidentally is the opposite of the ratio

postflop value is irrelevant.But note that a hand like AQ works as a blocker against Bob's premium hands (AA, AK, QQ).\nSo when Alice uses AQ as a bluff, it will be less likely that Bob has a hand he can 5-bet for value.", "4.\nOptimal strategy pairs for raiser/3-bettor with a CO raiser out of position After the thorough work with Alice raising ~15% in EP, we can now reap the rewards and quickly run through the same procedure with Alice raising a ~25% range in CO. She now opens a wider range, as a consequence, all other ranges get wider as well.\n4.1 Alice's optimal raising strategy for CO Raising from CO is a bit more situational than raising from EP.\nIt's now easier to isolate the blinds, and with a tight player on the button, it might be correct to play very loosely to get heads-up with position on the blinds.\nStill, everybody has a core range of hands that they always play, regardless of whether they have written this range down or not.\nWe'll assume Alice is using a TAG core range of ~25% in CO. More specifically, this range: Alice's CO range 22+, A2s+ A9o+, K9s+ KTo+, Q9s+ QTo+, J8s+ JTo, T8s+, 97s+, 87s, 76s, 65s, 326 combos, 25% Alice's value range Alice defends against 3-bets 30% of the time, and she does it by 4-betting 18% of her opening range for value and 12% as a bluff.\nSo she needs 0.18 x 326 =59 value combos that she can 4-bet and call a 5-bet with.\nIn EP she used [QQ+, AK} =34 combos, and in CO we simply add the next tier of hands and use {JJ+, AQ+} =56 combos (precise enough).\nThen she needs 0.12 x 326 =39 bluff combos.\nShe can pick ~39 specific combos and always 4-bet them (e.g.\nAJ, AT, TT =38 combos), or she can 4-bet all her non-value hands 15% of the time, as explained previously.\nWe choose the latter approach, and write Alice's complete raise strategy for CO as: Alice's optimal raise/4-bet/call 5-bet-strategy in CO: {Alice's total CO range} ={22+,A2s+,K9s+,Q9s+,J8s+,T8s+,97s+,87s,76s,65s, A9o+,KTo+,QTo+,JTo} ={value hands} + {4-bet bluff hands} ={JJ+, AQ+} + (15% 4-bet and 85% fold) x {the rest of the range} Alice raises {22+,A2s+,K9s+,Q9s+,J8s+,T8s+,97s+,87s,76s,65s, A9o+,KTo+,QTo+,JTo} =326 combos from CO.\nIf she gets 3-bet, she 4-bets {JJ+, AQ+} for value, planning to call a 5-bet.\nThose times she doesn't have a value hand (e.g.\n88, A9o, T9s, etc.\n), she 4-bets 15% of the time, and the rest of the time she folds.\nUsing a random number generator from That's it for Alice's CO strategy.\nOver to Bob: 4.2 Bob's optimal 3-bet-strategy against Alice's optimal raising strategy in CO Bob needs a value range, including an optimal number of 5-bet bluffs, and he needs a range of hands to 3-bet bluff.\nBob's pure value range Bob knows that Alice now uses {JJ+, AQ+} as her value range, so he builds a range of pure value hands that have at least 50% equity against {JJ+, AQ+}.\nAA and KK obviously belong in this range.\nTo see what else is included, we run equity calculations for the next tier of hands (QQ and AK): QQ and AK are barely above the threshold, while all weaker hands will be big underdogs.\nThus, Bob's pure value range is {QQ+, AK}, and he happily 3-bets these hands, and then 5-bets them all-in, purely for value.\nWe add 5-bet bluffs to Bob's value range We now want to add enough Axs hands so that Alice weakest value hands (JJ and AQ) are break even when they call our 5-bet range (and the threshold is 36% equity, as shown previously).\nWe start with A5s/A4s and see what we get: Alice's weakest value hand is AQ, and it's a small loser with 34% equity against Bob's total value range {QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s}.\nClose enough for us, so the 5-bet bluffs in this case are the same as we used against Alice's EP range.\nHowever, if we want it to be exact, we need to add a couple more bluffs (for example, Bob's 3-bet bluffing Bob's value range, including 5-bet bluffs, is {QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s} =42 combos.\nHe wants an optimal 40/60 value/bluff-ratio, so he needs 60/40 =1.5 times as many bluff combos.\nThis amounts to 1.5 x 42 =63 bluff combos.\nWe use the previously defined candidate list for 3-bet bluff hands: Candidate list for 3-bet bluffing: Ace high: A9s-A6s ATo-A8o (52 combos) King high: K9s-K6s, KJo-K9o (52 combos) Queen high: Q9s-Q6s, QJo-Q9o (52 combos) We bluff these hands some fixed percentage x, and for this to effectively correspond to 63 bluff combos, we need x =63/152 =41%.\nWe can round this to x =40% to make it easy to remember.\nWe remember that we used a 20% bluff candidate frequency against Alice's ~15% EP range.\nSo when Alice moves from a ~15% EP range to a ~25% CO range, our 3-bet bluff candidate frequency doubles.\nWe only need to memorize the candidate list, and these two numbers (20% vs EP and 40% vs CO), and then we know all we need to know about 3-bet bluffing optimally against Alice's EP/CO ranges.\nAt any rate, against Alice's optimal CO raising strategy, Bob gets: Bob's optimal 3-bet strategy against Alice's optimal raising strategy in CO {Bob's total 3-bet range} ={value hands and 5-bet bluff hands} + {3-bet bluff hands} ={QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s} + 40% x {A9s-A6s,ATo-A8o,K9s-K6s,KJo-K9o,Q9s-Q6s,QJo-Q9o} Using a randomizer from Bob's total 3-bet% for this scenario is: Value part: 42 combos (3.2% of all hands) Bluff part: Effectively 40% of 152 =61 combos (4.6% of all hands) This results in a total 3-bet range of 3.2 + 4.6 =7.8% against Alice's ~25% CO range.\nThe value/bluff ratio, using our numerical rounding, is 42/61, which is very close to the optimal 40/60.\nWhen Alice moves from EP to CO and her opening range changes from ~15% to ~25%, Bob responds by loosening up his 3-betting range dramatically.\nThis is an interesting observation.\nThose of you who use a more or less static 3-betting range (for example, the generic {JJ+, AQ} without any 3-bet bluffing that is recommended on many low limit forums) now have game theoretical \"proof\" that we can get away with a lot of 3-bet bluffing on the button against a CO raiser.\nEven against a TAG CO raiser with a solid ~25% opening range, you can 3-bet almost 8% on the button and there isn't anything he can do to exploit your loose 3-bets.", "We can write Alice's total EP range as a sum of value hands (raise, 4-bet for value, call a 5-bet) and bluff hands (raise, 4-bet bluff, fold to a 5-bet): {Alice's total EP range}

98s, 87s, 76s, AJo+, KQo} =186 combos from EP.\nIf she gets 3-bet, she 4-bets {QQ+, AK} for value and calls a 5-bet with them.\nThose times she doesn't have a value hand, (e.g.\nshe has JJ, AJo, 76s, etc.\n), she 4-bets 15% of the time as a bluff, and otherwise she folds.", "People generally don't 4-bet bluff enough, and they are also reluctant to tighten up their 4-bet value ranges when they get exploited by very tight 5-betting (e.g.\n5-bets that are 100% for value).\nFor example.\na typical low limit TAG with a ~15% EP range might have decided to never 4-bet bluff, and always 4-bet QQ and AK for value and call a 5-bet with them.\nAnd he is unlikely to change that plan, even if Bob's exploitative response is to drop all 5-bet bluffs from his value range, and only 5-bet-shove {KK+}, purely for value.", "For example, we'll see that AK isn't strong enough to be a value hand for Bob against Alice's EP range, so AK goes into the flatting range in this scenario.\nBut when Alice opens a much wider ~25% range in CO, AK is promoted to a value hand that is 3-bet and 5-bet for value.\nMore about that later in the article.\nSo let's begin defining Bob's optimal 3-bet/5-bet strategy in position against Alice's optimal raise/4-bet/call 5-bet strategy with a ~15% EP range: Bob's pure value range Bob knows that Alice EP range is ~15% (14% to be exact), and therefore he can draw the same conclusion Alice just did, namely that her optimal value 4-betting range is {QQ+, AK}.", "Here is a soccer analogy in these World Cup times: Moving QQ/AK from the flatting range up to the value range against a ~15% opening range is a bit like moving a defender forward and using him as a striker.\nSure, he might score a goal or two, but he isn't quite good enough for the job.\nBut he is too good to sit on the bench, so he should play.\nTherefore, since there is another job for which he is well qualified (defending), we let him play there.\nThe right man for the right job.\nBob will therefore flat QQ, AK and various other medium strong hands/implied odds hands after a ~15% open-raise from Alice.", "We'll now find the optimal strategy pair for Alice and Bob when Alice open-raises from early position (EP =UTG or MP), and it's folded to Bob in position.It's of course possible to vary EP opening ranges a lot, according to opponent tendencies and general game conditions.\nBut the core strategy for a typical TAG is to open somewhere around 15% of his hands (plus/minus a couple of percentage points in both directions) from both EP positions, and slightly tighter from UTG than from MP.", "Value hands are per definition hands we plan to raise and reraise until we are all-in.\nBluff hands are hands we plan to fold if our opponent reraises us back.We now begin the job of

respond in 3-ways: He can 3-bet (for value or as a bluff), he can flat, or he can fold.\nDifferent hands have different jobs to do within these ranges.\nAnd depending on Alice's opening range, hands

and AK aren't strong enough to use as value hands, even if they have strong equity against Alice's total opening range.\nThe reason is that they can not profitably get the whole stack in Against the range Alice is willing to get all-in with, namely {QQ+, AK}.", "Under these assumptions, we'll find an with a raising strategy (including defense against a 3-bet and against a 5-bet) for Alice, and a 3-betting strategy (including defense against a 4-bet) for Bob.\nWe'll find a unique strategy pair for each of Alice's positions (e.g.\nfor each of her opening ranges).\nWe'll soon see how these strategy pairs follow from Alice's opening range, but first, let's talk a bit about optimal strategy pairs: When our two players Alice and Bob are playing optimally against each other, Alice's strategy and Bob's strategy make up an optimal strategy pair.", "His total value range is {KK+, A5s, A4s} =20 combos, so Bob can pick 1.5 x 20 =30 3-bet bluff combos.\nAs mentioned previously, there are two techniques Bob can use: Pick 30 specific combos and always 3-bet them 3-bet all hands from the candidate list a certain percentage of the time I prefer the percentage method.\nTo use it, we only need to memorize the candidate range once and for all, plus one number (the % we 3-bet bluff the candidate hands).", "On average, Bob gets 0.30 x 201.5 =60bb back from the pot, so his net loss after 5-betting and getting called is 88 60 =28bb.\nThe pot size before Bob's 5-bet is 40.5bb (1.5 from the blinds, + 27 from Alice's 4-bet + 12 from Bob's 3-bet).\nSo Bob is effectively risking 28bb to win 40.5bb when he is 5-bet bluffing.", "This might sound like a lot of work, but in practice it all follows from estimates about the ranges you meet.\nAnd small deviations don't change things dramatically.\nFor example, when you know the strategy pair corresponding to a 15% opening range, you can apply the same strategies against a 12% raiser and an 18% raiser without losing much accuracy.\nYou won't play optimally in these cases, but near-optimally is close enough.", "We'll do this thoroughly and methodically, so that you can learn the procedures inside out.\nI hope you'll see that these strategies aren't really complicated to construct and then apply at the table.\n3.\nOptimal strategy pairs for raiser/3-bettor with an EP raiser out of position We'll now find the optimal strategy pair for Alice and Bob when Alice open-raises from early position (EP =UTG or MP), and it's folded to Bob in position.", "We have gone through the theory for game theory optimal(ish) raising/3-betting/4-betting/5-betting with the raiser out of position, and then we demonstrated how the theory can be implemented and used at the table.\nWe constructed optimal strategy pairs (one strategy for the raiser, and one for the 3-bettor) for two scenarios.\nFirst with the raiser in EP (UTG or MP) with a ~15% range, and then with the raiser in CO with a ~25% range.\nIn both scenarios we gave the raiser a standard TAG opening range.\nWe then deduced optimal strategies for both players as a function of the raisers opening range.\nWe observed that the strategies for the CO scenario involved considerably looser ranges than the strategies for the EP scenario.", "We simply choose 27bb as a representative value for a less-than-pot 4-bet, and the math won't change much if you use any number between 25bb and 30b instead.\nHere are a few assumptions/statements we will use: The last statement needs an explanation: When we're 3-betting/4-betting/5-betting as a bluff, we should not lose money on our bluffing hands, and the worst of them should be no worse than break even.\nThe same goes for when we're calling for pot odds.\nThis makes sense if you think about it.\nWhen we're making a play that loses money, we should stop doing it to increase our EV.", "I have chosen an approach where we first go through the necessary math and theory quickly, and then we apply it by constructing optimal strategy pairs for two scenarios: The raiser in early position (UTG or MP) with a 15% opening range The raiser in CO with a 25% opening range Lumping UTG and MP together under the label \"EP\" makes sense, since most players use very similar ranges for these two positions.\nThe percentages we have chosen for EP and CO are typical TAG ranges that can be used under all game conditions.\nThe exact ranges we use to illustrate the procedures aren't important.\nOur goal is that you learn to construct optimal strategy pair (one strategy for the raiser and one for the 3-bettor) based on your own opening ranges.\nAnd you will of course also be able to design optimal strategy pairs to use against specific opponents (not on the fly, but by doing a bit of analysis work between sessions).", "If you need to apply the theory to other ranges, just plug them into the method, and construct the strategy pairs yourself.\nWe didn't look at small blind vs big blind in this article, even if it falls under the same category with the raiser out of position.\nI elected to leave this situation out, since blind vs blind dynamics is very dependent on the players involved, and the history between them.\nSo it's difficult (and probably not very useful) to try and generalize and assign SB a standard opening range.", "Note that we're not concerned about the effects of deception when we work with game theory.\nWe're only concerned with immediate EV.\nAlso, if we're making money on all our bluffs or our calls, we can make even more money by bluffing more and calling more.\nSo we keep adding bluffs and calling hands until our weakest hands are at the break even point, and then we stop.\nConversely, if we're losing money on some of our bluffing or calling hands, we remove them from our ranges.\nAgain, this results in our weakest bluffing/calling hands being no worse than break even.", "We'll construct all strategies/ranges with great detail for this scenario, so that there won't be any doubt about how to apply the theory.\nThen we'll move on to the scenario with Alice in CO, and do this quickly, with brief comments along the way."]
