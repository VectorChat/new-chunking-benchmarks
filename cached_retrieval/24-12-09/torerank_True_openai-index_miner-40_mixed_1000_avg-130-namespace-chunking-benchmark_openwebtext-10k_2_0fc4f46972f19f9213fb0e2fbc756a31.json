["Michael Ayers (1975, 1991b: 39\u201350) believes that the only substratum that Locke acknowledges is the unknown\u2014and, Locke thinks, unknowable by us\u2014structure of the minute parts.\nThis is what he elsewhere characterizes as the real essence.\nIt is clear from the text that Locke is at least uneasy with the idea of \u2018pure substance in general\u2019, but it is less clear whether he feels obliged to accept an idea he dislikes, or whether he rejects it.\n(For the view that he accepts it, and why, see Bennett, 1971 and 1987.)\nThere are indications that Locke is confused about what he means by \u2018substratum\u2019.", "It is contested whether Locke actually believed in substance as a characterless substratum.\nAlthough the first quotation above seems to affirm it, Locke also in the same section speaks disparagingly about the idea, comparing it to the notion that the world rests on an elephant, which rests on a tortoise, and so on: in other words, as not constituting a real explanation at all.", "\u2018Bertrand Russell might have been a fried egg\u2019: that is, the thin particular associated with one set of properties and, hence, with one thing, might have belonged to another.\nDifferent properties might have been hung on this hook.\nIt is not so clear, by contrast, that a substratum of the kind Locke considers, or like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter, is a particular in this sense.\nIt is more like a kind of stuff\u2014the substantiveness on to which properties are stuck.\nOn this conception, the suggestion that the \u2018pieceof substratum or \u2018prime matterthat is here in object a, might always instead have been there in object b, seems to lack content.", "If, on the other hand, he means pure logical substratum, there is nothing to know, for there is no more to it, in either the material or spiritual case, than its role as substratum.\nHe seems to conflate the ignorance we have of minute parts with the logical emptiness of the idea of pure substratum.\nIn fact there are three issues concerning the material underpinning of things which Locke regards as mysterious, and he seems to move indifferently from one to the other.\nFirst, there is organization of the minute parts of particular kinds of objects, which is responsible for the manifest properties of those objects, and which he thinks will always fall beyond our knowledge.", "Do the size, shape, mass, solidity of a particular atom require a bare substratum to inhere in for them to constitute a coherent object?\nWould they, without such a substratum be just a stack of qualities, a house of cards with nothing holding them together?\nThere does not seem to be anywhere in the text where Locke discusses this problem\u2014that is, the coherence of atoms as opposed to composite objects\u2014explicitly.\nOne possible resort is to treat solidity as the core or master quality and all the others as features of it.", "The disposition of properties in nature need not have been as it is and might actually contain oddities not corresponding to any of our sortals.\nSortals, unlike Aristotelian species, place no constraints on how individual objects must or ought to be.\nLocke\u2019s contribution is, therefore, three-fold.\nHe brings to centre stage the question of whether properties require some substratum or bare particular to inhere in or belong to.\nHe asserts that the substantial nature of the physical world is the unknown structure of atomic parts, not a substantial form which reflects our usual concepts.", "(II 23 v) This argument seems to conflate the notions of substratum as pure logical support with that as minute parts.\nIf he means minute parts, then, though it is true that we do not and, in his view, cannot know in detail what they are, we have a theory, which he endorses, that they are probably minute parts as conceived by the atomists, which means they have primary qualities similar in kind though not in scale to those possessed by macroscopic objects.\nThis gives a coherent, though speculative, conception of material substance.\nOf spiritual substance, we have no similar hypothesis.", "Second is the mystery of what holds the minute parts together: the problem of explaining attraction in a system that only understands influence by impact.\n(xxiii 23).\nThird, is that idea of substance as a bare substratum, which is \u201ca supposed, I know not what, to support those ideas we call accidents.\u201d (xxiii 15).\nPerhaps it is more profitable to ask whether, in his own terms, Locke ought to have accepted bare substratum.\nIf we accept that the question of what binds together the qualities of a macroscopic object can be answered by appeal to the minute parts, the issue would then be what binds the primary qualities of atoms.", "Locke\u2019s \u2018particular substancesare kinds which are individuated conventionally, and so are not real substantial kinds, by Aristotelian standards.\nBut Locke is not without substance other than substratum, for his real essence\u2014that is, the atoms and their structures\u2014are his real substances, and what we say above about the substantiality of atoms also goes for Locke.\nIt is plausible to maintain the general thesis that there are many issues on which Hume was a sceptic or nihilist, but where his legacy is more reductionist than sceptical or nihilist.\nThis general thesis can be explained and illustrated by considering his treatment of substance, for it is a case in question.", "I must admit to having difficulties seeing why the view that objects are constituted solely out of property-instances should commit one to a mereological view, any more than the theory that they are constituted solely from material particles would, so I do not see this as a special problem for the bundle theory.\n3.2.2.\nThe concept of substratum or \u2018thin particularIf one is not satisfied with a bundle theory of substance, so that one thinks that an individual substance is more than a collection of properties, how is one to understand this \u2018more\u2019?", "Both these conceptions of substance provide difficulties of interpretation.\nThey also both relate to issues in contemporary philosophy of substance, in which Locke\u2019s influence is almost as important as Aristotle\u2019s.\n2.5.1 Locke on \u2018pure substance in generalLocke expresses this idea as follows: The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of those qualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist, sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia, which, according to the true import of the word, is in plain English, standing under or upholding.", "(ii) will not apply to a tropist theory, or if one thinks that location will do the job.\n(iii) rests on the intuition that no collection of properties could, in themselves, amount to a substance: the very idea is a category mistake, and only the presence of a special \u2018substantializingelement could do that.\nIt might be argued that this intuition begs the question against the bundle theory.\nAt the current state of the debate, it looks as if there is no compelling reason for accepting substratum.\nThe Aristotelian tradition anchors the concept of substance, at least in nature, primarily to instances of species of natural object.", "One way out of this problem may be to resort to the notion of a master property which was invoked in the discussion of Locke on substratum (2.5.1); that is, to the notion of one property of which all the others are modes, as visual shape is a mode of colour, or extension is the master property of matter for Descartes.\nIn the Newtonian model, solidity might fill this role, for shape is merely the outline of the solidity which constitutes the heart of the object.\nIn a sense, theories of this kind are not ordinary bundle theories, for one property is chosen to fill the role of substratum, because the other properties inhere in, or are modes of, it.", "(II xxiii 2) The traditional rationale of Locke\u2019s doctrine of \u2018substance in generalis as follows.\nProperties\u2014or, in Locke\u2019s terms qualities\u2014must belong to something\u2014\u2018cannot subsist\u2026without something to support them\u2019.\nOf course, they belong to objects, but what are objects over and above their properties?\nThe special category of substantial form, as found in Aristotle, is rejected.\nAll that seems to be left is a bare \u2018something\u2019, which on pain of regress, has no properties in its own right, except the property of being the owner or support of other properties.\nThis interpretation of Locke\u2019s notion of \u2018substance in generalis, however, a matter of controversy.", "As what it recognizes as out there in the world is just a bundle of properties, it does not dissolve the problem in the way that a deflationist would require.\nSubstantive theories take the thought of a further component seriously, and, though they do not seem to be generally distinguished, there are two main conceptions of this extra element, which I will call the \u2018thin particularand the \u2018substratumconceptions.\n\u2018Thin particularis an expression of D. M. Armstrong\u2019s.\nIt is the particular in abstraction from its properties.\nWhen considered with its properties it is a thick particular.\nThe important point is that thin particulars really are particulars.", "As we shall see, the idea that there is a real unity which is passed on through the life of an object or through any principle of organization is something that Hume criticizes and rejects.\nThe potential for a stronger realism in Locke has been exploited by Putnam and Kripke in their development of a modern, essentialist conception of natural kind terms.\nLocke was pessimistic in two connected respects.\nFirst he was sceptical about the possibility of science discovering the nature of the real essences\u2014the structures of atoms or molecules\u2014that underlie kinds of substance picked out by our ordinary sortals.", "If this is correct, then our ordinary \u2018natural kindconcepts, like water and gold, have built into them intimations of a deeper unity than that supplied by superficial features, even if it be allied to a complete agnosticism about what that unity might consist in or whether we might ever uncover it.\nHow does Locke, then, rate against the six criteria for substancehood that were set up in the introduction?\nAccepting, for these purposes, that Locke believed in substratum, we can apply these tests both to substratum, and to his \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2019.\nFirst, consider substratum.\n(i) Ontological basicness.", "(v) and (vi) Kinds of individuals and stuffs.\nAlthough in everything, it is itself no kind of thing and therefore no kind of individual or stuff.\nSubstratum\u2019s claim to substancehood does not rest, however, on meeting the tests itself, but on being what enables particular kinds of substances to be substances.\nAccording to the believer in substratum, it is in virtue of their inhering in a substratum that a collection of properties can constitute an enduring, change-sustaining thing of a certain kind.\nWithout that support, individual instances of properties could, if they could exist at all, be no more than ephemeral events.", "First, it has the intuitive disadvantage that it allocates two solid physical objects to the same place.", "One would never ask what binds together a patch of colour and its shape, because the shape is the shape of the colour patch, and, though the shape of something can change, its shape cannot come away from it, like a separable component.\nPerhaps the shape, size and density of an atom are similarly features of the solidity.\nThe quality solidity would then become equivalent to the notion of material stuff or material substance and Locke shows no sign of wanting to elide the ideas of quality and substance in this way, though it should be noted that this is what Descartes does with extension.", "Second, he doubted whether the objects picked out by our actual substance concepts really shared a real essence in the way we assume that they do.\nHe was not confident, that is, that everything we call gold, or iron, or a monkey, was actually interestingly similar at a non-superficial level.\nBoth these forms of pessimism proved largely unfounded.\nThe consequence of this is the possibility of bringing together real essence and the sortal concepts originally picked out by a nominal essence.\nWe now know water to be H2O and iron to be the element of atomic weight 56.\nOur substance concepts were, often at least, tracking real essences in the world.", "The other is that it cannot cope with the necessity of origin for individual identity.\nLowe responds to the former objection by saying that essential properties are identical with the substance, so cannot be cited as something other than substance that meets his criterion for being substance.\nIt is not clear that this will work.\nThe idea that the essence is identical with the substance is Aristotelian, but it is not clear how this applies to essential properties, taken individually.\nWe have already seen, in our discussion of Aristotle, that the relation between the essence as some kind of unity and the properties that seem to constitute it is not clear.", "It is useful at this point to take note of the three different functions the thin particular or substratum might fulfil.\nIts role might be (i) to bind the properties into a unity, so that they do not \u2018fall apart\u2019: (ii) to individualize them, if they are universals: (iii) to carry one across the categorial barrier from property to substance; that is, to be what it is that makes something to be in the category of substance.\nThe first role will not be necessary if one thinks that there is a \u2018master propertyof which the others are modes, or if one thinks that unity can come from some causal or organizational connection.", "According to Hume, in the Treatise, our belief in substance is the result of a mistake or illusion.\nWhen we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the smooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the succession\u2026When we compare its situation after a considerable change the progress of the thought is broken; and consequently we are presented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which contradictions, the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and invisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these variations; and this unintelligible something it calls a substance, or original and first matter.", "Lowe, in his (1998), which contains a very thorough discussion of all the topics discussed in this section, defends an \u2018independenceaccount of substance, which he states in terms of identity, as follows: x is a substance if and only if x is a particular and there is no particular y such that y is not identical to x and the identity of x depends on the identity of y.\nHe considers two objections to his own account which would seem to apply to all independence accounts.\nOne is that it cannot cope with essential properties, for it seems to imply that, for any given property-instance, a substance can exist without it, which is not true of essential properties.", "He either doubts that there are such things as substance or causation (scepticism) or even positively denies that there are (nihilism).\nOut of Hume\u2019s very forthright negative attitude there developed two more subtle variants.\nOne of these variants is in the empiricist tradition.\nThat tradition modified Hume\u2019s approach by developing it into a form of reductionism.\nThe experiences which gave rise, through habit, to the mistaken belief (in, for example, substance or causation) are presented as what the belief really affirms.\nThat is, the empirical basis for what Hume deems to be an illusion, is reinterpreted as the reductive account of the concept.", "Substances, considered as kinds, or instances of kinds, can sustain change\u2014living things, for example, change in size throughout their lives.\nMost individual parcels of matter, however, become different individuals if they change any of their parts; although we have seen that this does not apply to living things, where there seems to be a metaphysical component called sameness of life.\nIn general, Locke\u2019s particular substances are not ontologically basic, because their essences are nominal, though this is not so clearly true for sortals naming biological kinds.\nLocke\u2019s conceptualism about such substances makes most of the tests irrelevant, which are cast within a realist framework.", "The properties invoked by nominal essences are \u201csupposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance\u201d(xxiii 3).\nThis internal constitution \u201cmakes the whole subsist by itself\u201d (xxiii 6).\nThus Locke is entirely realist about individual bodies and their properties.\nHe is more conventionalist, however, about their classification under particular sortals.\nThere are four ways in which he is a conceptualist about particular substances, as we classify them.\nThere is nothing over and above the properties of an object corresponding to our substance concepts\u2014nothing, that is, like a substantial form\u2014present in the world.", "Buridan, who represents a further development in this direction, says In this sense, I am not the same as I was yesterday, because something was part of my integrity yesterday, which has already been used up, and something was not part of my integrity, which has meanwhile been added by nourishment.\n(Buridan, Physics I,q.10, f. xiii: cited Lagerlund, 476) It is clear that this way of thinking paves the way for atomism and its associated problems as they emerged in early modern philosophy.\nThe concept of substance figures centrally in a positive way for the rationalist philosophers, in a way that it does not for the empiricists.", "Because he does not believe in void, extension carries with it the other basic properties of matter as features of it.\n2.5.2 Locke on \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substanceThe ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2014called sortals\u2014are formed by collecting such combinations of simple ideas, as are by experience and observation of men\u2019s senses, taken notice of to exist together, and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance.\nThus we come to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water, etc\u2026 (II xxiii 3) Thus, for Locke, the real essence is an unknown atomic constitution.", "It is not possible to investigate here Leibniz\u2019s reasons for these apparently very strange views.\nOur present concern is with whether, and in what sense, Leibniz\u2019s substances are subjects of change.\nOne can say that, in so far as, at all times, they reflect the whole of reality, then they do not change.\nBut in so far as they reflect some parts of that reality more vividly than others, depending on their position in space and time, they can be said to change.\nAccording to Locke, we have two conceptions of substance.\nOne is a \u2018notion of pure substance in general(Essay II xxiii 2), the other \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substance(II xxiii 3).", "Substance, they say, is the only category of thing which might have only one instance through at least a minimally extended period of time.\nThus, for example, there is no possible world which has, in a given period of time, only one event, for any non-instantaneous event will be made of events which are its parts.\nSimilarly for properties or tropes, there can never be only one because any one entails the existence of others, as, for example, the existence of a red property (instance) entails the existence of (an instance of) the property colour.\nBy contrast, there could exist through a period of time just one substance, provided that it was atomic.", "The issue is how we are to understand the notion of an object, and whether, in the light of the correct understanding, it remains a basic notion, or one that must be characterized in more fundamental terms.\nWhether, for example, an object can be thought of as nothing more than a bundle of properties, or a series of events.\nThere could be said to be two rather different ways of characterizing the philosophical concept of substance.\nThe first is the more generic.\nThe philosophical term \u2018substancecorresponds to the Greek ousia, which means \u2018being\u2019, transmitted via the Latin substantia, which means \u2018something that stands under or grounds things\u2019.", "We have seen that Locke\u2019s particular substances are kinds of things, and because they are kinds they correspond to Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.\nBut we have also seen that the boundaries between these kinds are largely a matter of convention, which is not true of Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances.\nIn so far as their individuation is dependent on human convention, they are not ultimately real in their own right.\nBut though they are not real as kinds, the individual parcels of matter that we classify in these ways are perfectly real.\nLocke does not, as far as I can see, refer to these individuals as \u2018substances\u2019.", "He argues that the notion of spiritual substance is in no worse a predicament than material substance, because we have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of body: the one being supposed to be (without knowing what it is) the substratum to those simple ideas we have from without; and the other supposed (with a like ignorance of what it is) to be the substratum to those operations which we experiment in ourselves within.\n\u2018Tis plain then, that the idea of corporeal substance in matter, is as remote from our conceptions, and apprehensions, as that of spiritual substance, or spirit;\u2026.", "Third, he develops a theory of substance which is realist about particular objects and their properties, but conceptualist or conventionalist about our classifications, within the constraints that the facts about particulars and properties impose.\nThere is one important context, however, where Locke does not appear to talk in a conventionalist way about sortal identity, but in a way that seems to be reminiscent of substantial forms.\nThis is when he is discussing the individuation of living things.\nHe understands ordinary bodies as mereological sums of atoms.", "(1978: 220) Hume\u2019s target is any account that postulates a unifying \u2018somethingthat underlies change, whether this be a characterless substratum, a substantial form or (though this is not explicitly mentioned) something like the \u2018continuing lifethat Locke sees as passed on in living things.\nThe crucial point is that a succession of very similar things does not constitute the real continuation of anything, only the illusion of real continuation.\nThus Hume\u2019s treatment of substance is like his treatment of causation, in that he sees both as the projection onto the world of a tendency of our minds either to pass from one thing to another or to associate them in some way.", "His attitude towards the Aristotelian view is expressed later in the paragraph just quoted: \u2026a philosopher\u2026whatever substantial forms he may talk of, has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are found in them\u2026.\nLocke\u2019s doctrine of sortals is in some respects realist and in some conceptualist or conventionalist.\nIt is realist in at least the following ways.\nThe properties [ideas] in terms of which sortals are defined do correspond to real qualities and powers in the world.\nThere is no sense in which these building blocks of reality are creatures of our conceptual scheme.", "Thus, a particular instance of colour cannot exist, and could not have existed, without the object of which it is the colour, but the object can exist without the colour instance, for it may change colour and remain the same object, or it could have had a different colour from the start.\nVarious problems can be raised for this account.\nThe most obvious is that it does not, as stated, distinguish between substances and events.\nSome property-instances belong to events rather than substances.\nThe performance of a symphony, for example, is an event, and it may possess the property, in one of its movements, of being allegro.", "The ontological status of complex bodies and \u2018masses of matter(in Locke\u2019s phrase) is an issue very much under dispute and we shall return to it below.\n3.3.2 The \u2018isof constitution A statue and a lump of clay occupy the same place at a given time.\nWhat is their relation to each other?\nThe apparent options are (i) they are identical (ii) they are not identical, but the clay constitutes the statue.\n(i) appears to be ruled out because they have different identity conditions.\n(ii) has seemed to many philosophers to be the natural solution to the problem, but it, too, faces difficulties.", "He illustrates the various categories: each [individual term] signifies either substance or quantity or qualification or a relative or where or when or being in a position or having or doing or being affected.\nTo give a rough idea, ideas of substance are man, horse; of quantity: four foot, five foot; of qualification; white, grammatical; of a relative: double, half, larger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when: yesterday, last year; of being in a position: is-lying, is-sitting; of having: has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of being-affected: being-cut, being-burnt.", "Bennett offers one way out of the need to postulate a mysterious substratum.\nWhen I say \u2018This is an orangeI mean that there are here instances of certain properties such as orangeness, sphericality etc., and I indicate that I am operating on my ideas of those instances in a certain combining manner.\n(1987: 202.\nItalics added.)\nThis solution, as Bennett recognizes, makes substancehood a function of how we operate on the properties we perceive.\nIt is, in that sense, more Kantian than realist.", "But, if one were to conclude that the statue and the lump are neither identical nor stand in the constitution relation, what else could one say?\nOne strategy is to take the notion of body or material object as basic.", "We shall consider various rationalist and empiricist treatments of the concept.\nLocke\u2019s contribution will be considered in especial detail because so much contemporary discussion is inspired (as we shall see in section 3) by an Aristotle-Locke nexus.\nMany of the pre-socratic philosophers in fact had a concept of substance rather like that above attributed to chemistry: that is, their emphasis was on criterion (vi) above.\nThey thought, that is, that the being of the universe (hence they were pursuing substance in sense (i)) consisted in some kind or kinds of stuff.\nThales, for example, thought that everything was essentially water, and Anaximenes that everything was a form of air.", "We saw in the previous section that the differentia in terms of which a substance is defined is not treated as being \u2018inobjects, as other properties are.\nThis seems to suggest that calling an object a substance of a certain sort is not just a way of attributing to it the properties in terms of which it is defined.\nAristotle is undoubtedly a realist about substantial forms, in the sense of thinking them to be something more than a mere collection of properties, but how are we to understand this \u2018more\u2019?", "The concept of substance can be analysed in terms of some relation between properties conceived as universals.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of properties conceived of as individuals, e.g., as property-instances or tropes.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as universals.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived of as individuals.\nThe main objections to the \u2018universalsform of the theory rest on its apparent commitment to the Identity of Indiscernibles, for if an object is no more than a bundle of properties, then if a and b have exactly the same properties, they are the same bundle.", "Fat and the others are described as being in because they pick out a constituent feature that could be said to be, in a logical though not a physical sense, part of, or in him.\nFido the individual is not attributable to any further thing at all.\nThis account is intuitive, but perhaps it cannot be treated as a formally adequate definition of the notion of primary substance or individual.\nFido the individual could be said to be in a certain location and so attributed to something, namely a place.", "This question can be given a deflationary or a substantive answer.\nThe deflationary answer is that a substance is a thing which has properties, and that is all one needs to say.\n(See, for example, Crane and Farkas 2004, 143f, and Chisholm 1969.)\nAn object is not composed of properties and some further ingredient\u2014the \u2018thingybit\u2014an object is something which simply has properties.\nAny feature of it can, of course, be regarded as a property, but that does not render an object nothing but a collection of properties.\nThere seems to be a clash of intuitions at this point about what makes sense.", "This is reductionism, and it can operate in either of two ways, namely either analytical reductionism or what one might call de facto or \u2018nothing butreductionism.\nIn the present case, it would conform to the analytical option if the concept of substance could be analysed in terms of properties or events (e.g., \u2018to be a substance =df to be a collection of properties bound together in way W\u2019).\nBut one might still hold that, though the concept of substance is not precisely analysable and is indispensible, substances in fact are nothing but collections of properties.", "This assumption makes it possible to state substance individuation using the language of identity.\nWithin the scope of this assumption, he makes two claims.\nThe first is the sortal relativity of identity: that is, when any a and b are asserted to be the same thing, they must be the same something-or-other, and the something-or-other must be the kind of concept that answers \u2018what is it?questions.\nIn other words, there is no such a thing as \u2018bare identity\u2019\u2014identity under no concept at all.\nFurthermore, the relevant concept must be an Aristotelian substance concept or sortal.", "This involves reinterpreting the rationale of our substance concepts.\nLocke thought that our concept of gold was properly expressed as \u2018anything gold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia\u2019.\nHe thought that we add the optimistic assumption that there will be similarity at the microscopic level.\nWhat many philosophers, under Putnam\u2019s influence, now think he should have said is that gold is that kind of thing which is individuated by a particular kind of minute structure that underlies the stuff which is gold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia.\nIn other words, our confidence that these kinds have a genuine real essence is built into the concept.", "Two major areas of controversy require attention.\nFirst, there are the issues concerning how to characterize substance in contradistinction to properties and the other categories.\nThere are at least two major questions here.\nOne concerns defining the notion of substance.\nIn particular, there has been much debate about whether substance can be accounted for in terms of its special kind of independence.\nThe other is whether substancehood require some extra component beyond properties, (and, if so, what?)\nor whether a \u2018bundle of propertiestheory of substance is adequate.\nSecond there is the relation between substances and our practices of individuation and reidentification.", "For footed and two-footed are said of man as subject, but are not in a subject; neither footed not two-footed is in man.\n(3 a23\u20135) It would seem that these properties belong to objects in different ways when they are part of a definition from when they are not.\nThe issue is what constitutes the unity of the species or secondary substance: why is it not just a collection of properties and, if it is just such a collection, why is it so different from any other collection of properties?", "They are: (1) explaining and justifying the sense in which substantial forms have causal or explanatory power, especially in the light of a developed mechanistic chemistry or physics; (2) the difficulty in understanding the relation of substantial form to properties, especially those in terms of which a given substance is defined.\nThese are connected.\nIt is because the substantial form has genuine causal force that it is conceived of by Aristotle as a unified entity in its own right, and not just as a name for the collocation of properties in terms of which it is defined.\n(One subject that has not been discussed is the connection between the doctrine of substance and teleology.", "It is a necessary condition for F\u2019s being an ultimate sortal that, whenever it applies to something, it applies in a present-tensed manner to the thing through the whole of its existence.\nThe statue and the lump of clay are dealt with by denying that the lump and the statue are identical: the lump of clay constitutes the statue, but is not identical with it.\nNotice that he could have argued that the statue was just a phase of the lump, but he does not do so because statue is not, by its very meaning, a phase sortal: statue, unlike child, does not indicate by its meaning a period in the existence of something.", "This can be expressed as: The substances in a given system are those entities crucial from the teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucialmeans that other things exist either to constitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.\nDifferent philosophers emphasize different criteria from amongst this list, for reasons connected with their system as a whole.", "Leibniz acknowledges created substances, though they are very intimately dependent on God.\nIn the Discourse on Metaphysics, (Section 14), he says: it is clear that created substances depend on God, who conserves them and indeed who produces them continuously by a kind of emanation, just as we produce our thoughts.\n(1998: 66) The analogy with thought hardly emphasizes the independence of substance!\nNevertheless, created substances do constitute the created world, and do, in that sense, meet criterion (i) for being substance.", "Whether anything could perform this role from amongst the properties that are basic to modern, post-Newtonian physics\u2014properties such as charm, energy, spin and mass\u2014is not easy to judge.\nOne objection often made against the theory is that bundles are mereological sums, rather like Locke\u2019s \u2018masses of matter\u2019, and that, therefore, any change of property is a change in the identity of the object.\nVarious forms of essentialist solutions to this problem have been suggested, for example, by Simons (1994), and Barker and Jago (2018).", "The physical mass that houses both the sword and the walking stick can be identified independently of either.\nIf this were not the case it is difficult to see how one could even make the mistake of thinking of it as one thing.\nThe composites Siamese entities form are quite identifiable, and yet that entity is not supposed to fall under a sortal in its own right.", "The situation is different for mental substance.\nThe cogito shows that Descartes definitely believes that each person is a different individual mental substance.\nDescartes, like the atomists, believed that matter operates in an entirely mechanical way.\nThere is, therefore, no causal role for substantial form to play and, hence, no need for such forms.\nHis two substances are each defined in terms of one property (extension for matter and thought for mind), hence there is no problem about the relation between substance and the properties in terms of which it is defined.\nAs he does not have substances as individuals made of kinds of stuff, there is no conflict between individuals and stuffs.", "(Essay II.27.4) One might wonder what this \u2018common lifeis supposed to be, especially in the light of his rejection of Aristotelian \u2018substantial forms\u2019.\nFurthermore, it is tempting to argue that all coherent, solid bodies\u2014such as a lump of rock or plasticene\u2014have some principle of organization which persists through change.\nLiving objects are simply the most dramatic case of this.\n(Though Peter van Inwagen (1990) defends the view that only living things and atoms are real entities: inanimate complex bodies are not true individuals.)", "Nevertheless, though the appeal to \u2018lifeseems to modify Locke\u2019s conventionalism, it still leaves open the possibility that the divisions we make between different species are conventions, because, though we can recognize life (or a \u2018continuing principle of organization\u2019) itself, it is still relatively arbitrary and concept-dependent where life (or \u2018principle of organization\u2019) of one kind ends and another starts.\nSo our division of things into species, though grounded in real continuities in the way that our non-biological (or non-natural) concepts are not, is still nominal.", "According to this, substances are a particular kind of basic entity, and some philosophical theories acknowledge them and others do not.\nOn this use, Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are not substances, even though they are the building blocks of\u2014what constitutes \u2018beingfor\u2014his world.\nAccording to this usage, it is a live issue whether the fundamental entities are substances or something else, such as events, or properties located at space-times.\nThis conception of substance derives from the intuitive notion of individual thing or object, which contrast mainly with properties and events.", "The following theses might plausibly be maintained.\nFor any identifiable and re-identifiable object, there must be some predicate F which applies to it in a present-tense manner through the whole of its existence, and which, by its meaning, picks the object out as a unified physical whole.", "They are not individual objects nor kinds of individual object.\nExamples of this usage are water, hydrogen, copper, granite or ectoplasm.\nThere is a connotation of the word \u2018substance\u2019, reflected in the sense of substantial, which signifies durability or even permanence.\nEvents, or Hume\u2019s impressions and ideas are never substantial in this sense, because they are fleeting.\nAtoms, fundamental kinds of stuff, gods, or abstract entities, such as Platonic Forms or numbers, might be considered to be substantial to the point of being indestructible or eternal: they last at least as long as the world exists\u2014and, in the case of gods or God, or abstract entities, perhaps longer.", "The Kantian tradition ties it to those enduring bodies the individuation of which gives sense and structure to our spatio-temporal framework.\nDavid Wiggins (1967, 1980, 2001) has made a sustained attempt to prove that these two objectives necessarily go together and to make the Aristotelian notion of substance, even including its bias towards the biological, central to our practice of individuating objects.\nWiggins assumes that individuating a temporally enduring object involves being able to re-identify it at different times and under different descriptions.", "This latter is the de facto option.\nSo the existence of substances does not show that the concept is important from a philosophical perspective, or, if it has some significance, whether this is just as a necessary part of our conceptual scheme, or as an ineliminable feature of reality itself.\n3.2.1 Bundle theories and their problems We have just noted that there could be analytically reductionist or de facto reductionist accounts of substance in terms of properties.\nIt is also the case that the properties might be conceived of as universals, or as individuals\u2014that is, property-instances, which are sometimes called \u2018tropes\u2019.\nThere are, therefore, four options for the bundle theorist.", "It seems plausible that this particular case of something\u2019s being allegro could not have been exemplified by another performance, but the performance might go on to be andante in another movement, so the event can continue to exist without that original property.\nThe assimilation of events with substances in this way seems strained, however.\nIt does not seem natural to say that the same event was first allegro, then andante, because it is more natural to attribute the different properties to different parts of the event, which are themselves events (in this case, movements).", "We shall see later that the Kantian tradition adds a seventh mark of substance: substances are those enduring particulars that give unity to our spatio-temporal framework, and the individuation and re-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that framework.\n(It should be remarked in passing that at least one major expositor of Aristotle (Irwin: 1988, especially chs 1, 9, 10) attributes a very similar intention to Aristotle himself.)\nIn section 3.5 we shall introduce a notion grounded in Aristotle\u2019s account, but which has not naturally found a place in the earlier discussion, namely the connection between substance and teleology.", "In that way, it will be possible to avoid the need to have two material objects in the same place.", "On its own, \u2018same bodyis just not very explanatory.", "The case where the lump and the sortally individuated object do not coincide, applies only to some problematic artefactual cases, and in those cases the sortal name of the artefact will not be suitable substitute for F, but the \u2018lumpexpression will be.", "As Mackie (2000) points out, the full statement of this theory involves various relatively ad hoc restrictions.\nMore importantly, it does not seem to explain what unifies the category of substance, for it does not say that it is true of any substance that it could conceivably be the only substance existing for a period of time\u2014indeed, it could not apply to non-atomic substances, for complex ones can exist only if other substances\u2014those that constitute their parts\u2014also exist.\nIt implies only that something from the category of substance might so exist and that this could not be true of any other category.", "One could plausibly say that an account is intuitively more appealing, the more of the criteria it can find a place for.\nProbably, the Aristotelian tradition comes nearest to doing this.\nAlmost all major philosophers have discussed the concept of substance and an attempt to cover all of this history would be unwieldy.\nThe selection made will concentrate on those philosophers in whom the broadly analytic tradition has shown most interest.\nFirst we shall look at the development of the concept in the ancient world, culminating in the work of Aristotle.\nHis account dominated debate through the Middle Ages and until the early modern period.", "Being able to receive contraries.\n(4 a10) A substance can go from being hot to being cold, or from being red to being blue, but the instance of blue in an object cannot similarly take on and lose a wide range of attributes.\nIf substance did not exist it would be impossible for things in any of the other categories to exist.\nThere could be no instances of properties if there were no substances to possess them.\nBut these criteria do not show why \u2018dogis a secondary substance term and \u2018brown thingis not.\nSo we need marks for being a secondary substance, or substance concept.", "As such, any change of particle constitutes a new object, for a mereological sum is individuated by its parts and a change of parts means a change of the object constituted by those parts.\nTreating ordinary, non-living, bodies as complex enduring objects is a matter of convention determined by the concepts we happen to possess.\nLiving things, however, have a deeper principle of unity.\nThat being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in one coherent body, partaking of one common life, it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life, though that life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant\u2026.", "The matter is still an essential component in the substance, but not, so to speak, as an equal partner with the form, but as the catalyst by means of which the form becomes an individual substance.\nIt is clear, however, that if one holds that Aristotle thinks that forms are universals, then forms are not substance, for, in his attacks on Plato, Aristotle makes it plain that universals are not substance.\nSubstances for Aristotle are individuals, but it is much debated whether they are individualized forms or composites of form and matter.\nThere are at least three serious questions about Aristotle\u2019s substantial forms.", "The problem for this version of the bundle theory seems to be that it is difficult to individuate or distinguish tropes in a way that makes them suitable to be individuals\u2014in one sense, the substances\u2014from which objects are made.\n(Armstrong 1989, 115ff) For example, if an object has a size, a mass, and a motion, are the size and the mass different tropes and is it not strange to think of the size alone as a genuine particular suited to be treated as an \u2018atomiccomponent of the whole?", "There is a sense in which it is ontologically basic, but it is a rather empty sense: it is the substancehood of everything, without explaining the nature of anything.\n(ii) Durability.\nAgain, it meets the criterion, but in an empty way.\nIt is difficult to see how it could be destroyed (like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter) but it has no positive nature.\n(iii) and (iv) Bearer of predication and subject of change.\nAs with matter for Aristotle, it meets the first of these standards well, but, in so far as it is a component only in atoms, it is not the subject of change.", "That this table, for example, could have been the same object even if made from different material does not have the same plausibility.\nWhether these objections to the above versions of the independence account can be answered is unclear.\nHoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994 and 1997) develop a different, though probably not incompatible, conception of the relative independence of substances compared to other categories.", "On this he says two things.\n\u2018It is reasonable that, after the primary substances, their species and genera should be the only other things called (secondary) substance.\nFor only they, of things predicated, reveal the primary substance.(2 b28\u201330) \u2018Of the secondary substances the species is more a substance than the genus, since it is nearer to the primary substance.\nFor if one is to say of the primary substance what it is, it will be more apt to give the species than the genus.(2 b8\u201311) The second of these two points is more uncontroversial than the first, for it is indubitable that species terms focus more precisely on particular things than generic terms.", "Anything can be substituted for F which picks the object out as a unified body.", "It seems, in summary, that there are at least six overlapping ideas that contribute to the philosophical concept of substance.\nSubstances are typified as: being ontologically basic\u2014substances are the things from which everything else is made or by which it is metaphysically sustained; being, at least compared to other things, relatively independent and durable, and, perhaps, absolutely so; being the paradigm subjects of predication and bearers of properties; being, at least for the more ordinary kinds of substance, the subjects of change; being typified by those things we normally classify as objects, or kinds of objects; being typified by kinds of stuff.", "He copes with the second by denying that origin is essential to identity.\nUnfortunately, he argues for this position by citing human subjects: Socrates, for example, would still have been who he was even if he had had different parents.\nThis is, of course, controversial about humans, but it is our Cartesian intuitions that make it plausible in that case.", "If a monad is at place p at time t, it will contain all the features of the universe at all times, but with those relating to its own time and place most vividly, and others fading out roughly in accordance with temporal and spatial distance.\nBecause there is a continuum of perspectives on reality, there is an infinite number of these substances.\nNevertheless, there is internal change in the monads, because the respect in which its content is vivid varies with time and with action.\nIndeed, the passage of time just is the change in which of the monad\u2019s contents are most vivid.", "Let us agree, for purposes of argument, that human being is a kind of substance and that rationality and animality are the properties in terms of which that substance is defined.\nIt is uncontroversial that these properties are meant to be objective features of the external world.\nBut what is the relation between the substantial form and those properties?\nIs the presence of the substantial form human being nothing more than the presence of those properties, or is the form something further which is, in some sense responsible for the presence of those properties?", "This introduces a category of what one might call Siamese objects.", "The rationalistssubstances are not, however, the individual objects of everyday life.\nDescartes believed in only two kinds of substance: material body, which is defined by extension, and mental substance, which is defined by thought, which, in this context, is more or less equivalent to consciousness.\nDescartes (like Aristotle and unlike most of his contemporaries and immediate successors) was not an atomist.\nHe did not believe in a void between bodies, so there is a sense in which there is just one material substance, numerically as well as specifically.\nFor Descartes, therefore, material substance falls more naturally into the stuff category, rather than into the thing category.", "It also avoids the need to employ the \u2018\u201cis\u201d of constitutionto link sortals and particulars, like lumps and hunks, rather than just mass terms, such as \u2018clayor \u2018gold\u2019.", "Whereas, for Aristotle, the properties that an object has to possess and those that it possesses throughout its existence coincide, they do not do so for Leibniz.\nThat is, for Leibniz, even the properties that an object possesses only for a part of its existence are essential to it.\nEvery monad bears each of its properties as part of its nature, so if it were to have been different in any respect, it would have been a different entity.", "Perhaps it is better, therefore, to see Aristotle in Categories not as defining \u2018substance\u2019, so that someone wholly lacking the concept might come to understand it, but as exhibiting the marks and characteristics of a primitive concept on which we have an intuitive grasp.\nIf we understand his project in this way, we can see Aristotle as presenting various marks of substance in Categories.\nThe marks of primary substance are: Being objects of predication but not being themselves predicable of anything else (at least, not in the way entities in the other categories are: see the problem about attribution to location above).", "(Such expressions as \u2018a person of substanceor \u2018a substantial reasonwould be cases of this.\n\u2018Illegal substancesis nearer to one of the philosophical uses, but not the main one.)\nThere is an ordinary concept in play when philosophers discuss \u2018substance\u2019, and this, as we shall see, is the concept of object, or thing when this is contrasted with properties or events.\nBut such \u2018individual substancesare never termed \u2018substancesoutside philosophy.\nReflection on the concept of an object has its first theoretical articulation in Aristotle\u2019s Categories, where he distinguishes between individual objects and the various kinds of properties they can possess.", "This collection of atoms in this structure is what investigation would show to be really there.", "One we have already noticed, namely (i) whether such forms are universals or particulars.\nThe others are (ii) what is the relationship between the substantial form and the properties which enter into its definition?\nWe have already noticed this question when discussing Categories.\n(iii) What is the ontological status of such forms?\nThis is connected with the second question, for it is connected with the question of what the substantial form is over and above the properties essential to it.\nWhat I mean by this is as follows.", "In fact it implies that every individuable object falls under just one ultimate sortal.\n(Wiggins admits this in (2001: 67 n.7).\nWhat is meant by ultimate sortal will emerge below.)\nFor every ultimate sortal has its own principle of individuation, and if an object fell under more than one, there could be a time at which it satisfied the criteria for one and not for the other.\nWiggins\u2019s thesis is a very strong claim, apparently backed up by a powerful argument.\nIt is a strong claim for it purports to prove that any world with individuable objects must be constituted by Aristotelian substances.", "This brings out a major difference between substances and events, namely that the temporal parts of events are themselves events in their own right, but the temporal parts of objects\u2014meaning by that expression the temporal phases of an object\u2019s existence\u2014are not themselves objects.\nIndeed, it is not natural to talk of the temporal parts of objects, though some philosophers (led by David Lewis (1986), but see also Sider (2001), Hawley (2001) and the entry on temporal parts) think that there are compelling philosophical reasons for doing so.\nThe rationale implicit in our ordinary concept is that an object is wholly present at all the temporal points of its existence.", "The division between being said of and being in\u2014that is, between substance concepts and other properties\u2014seems intuitively clear enough until one remembers that substance concepts are complex and are definable in terms of other properties.\nThus, \u2018manis defined as \u2018featherless bipedor \u2018rational animal\u2019, and it would seem that \u2018featherless\u2019, \u2018two-footedor \u2018rationalare properties and hence the kinds of things that are in objects.\nAristotle denies that this is so when they enter into the definition of a substance.\nThe features that specifically make an object the kind of substance that it is, are called differentiae, and Aristotle says the differentia also is not in a subject.", "But it is only a contingent truth that the terms that can substitute for F in his formal proof are generally\u2014but not always\u2014sortals of an Aristotelian kind.", "The point cannot be made quite so simply, however.\nProperties could not exist without objects to be properties of, but neither could substances exist without properties, so the dependence appears to be mutual.\nThis problem can be overcome by more careful expression of the point, making it clear that we are not talking about properties in general and substances in general, but about particular instances or cases of a property and the particular objects to which they belong.\nA particular property instance cannot exist and could not have existed without the substance of which it is a property, but the particular substance can exist and could have existed without that property instance.", "All natural ultimate sortals designate unified physical bodies in the manner prescribed in (1), and so are very suitable as substitutions for F. It is logically possible, however, that this might not have been so (there might logically have been natural sortals that worked like swordstick), but that they do follow this model, and are not like swordstick, is a pretty deep fact about our world and about any world with similar laws of nature to those that hold in our world."]
