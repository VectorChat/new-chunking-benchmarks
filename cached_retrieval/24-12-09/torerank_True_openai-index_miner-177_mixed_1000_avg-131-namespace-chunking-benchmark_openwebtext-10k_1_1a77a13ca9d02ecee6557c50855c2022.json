against an EP open-raise?\nCorrect.\nAgainst Alice's tight and optimally played ~15% EP opening range, QQ and AK aren't strong enough to use as value hands, even if they have strong equity against Alice's total opening range.", "We'll give a quick example in the summary below, and the procedure will be thoroughly discussed later in the article.We summarize everything we have learned about Alice's optimal strategy for raising, 4-betting and calling 5-bets:- She needs to 4-bet 30% of her opening range- Her 4-betting range should have a 60/40 value/bluff ratioSo Alice's optimal strategy is:So Alice's value hands are the top 18% of her opening range.\nFor example, if she opens 15% from UTG, this corresponds to a value range of 0.18 x 0.15 =2.7% of all hands.\nThis makes up 0.027 x 1326 =36 combos, e.g approximately the range {QQ+, AK} =34 combos.\nWe'll use this value range example when we summarize Bob's optimal strategy below.", "Then we'll move on to the scenario with Alice in CO, and do this quickly, with brief comments along the way.We assume Alice is opening with a ~15% EP range.\nNote that any 15'ish% EP-range will do, since our work is based on the numbers of hands in the range, and not the specific hands it contains.\nObvious value hands like high pairs and AK have to be included, since these hands have a job to do in the ranges for 4-betting and calling 5-bets.\nBut the exact mixture of medium and weak hands in Alice's range is irrelevant.We give Alice the following range:22+ATs+ AJo+KTs+ KQoQTs+J9s+T9s98s87s76s186 combos14%We now place Bob somewhere with position on Alice.\nAlice open-raises and it's folded to Bob, who 3-bets.", "We add 5-bet bluffs to Bob's value range We now want to add enough Axs hands so that Alice weakest value hands (JJ and AQ) are break even when they call our 5-bet range (and the threshold is 36% equity, as shown previously).\nWe start with A5s/A4s and see what we get: Alice's weakest value hand is AQ, and it's a small loser with 34% equity against Bob's total value range {QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s}.\nClose enough for us, so the 5-bet bluffs in this case are the same as we used against Alice's EP range.\nHowever, if we want it to be exact, we need to add a couple more bluffs (for example, Bob's 3-bet bluffing Bob's value range, including 5-bet bluffs, is {QQ+, AK, A5s, A4s} =42 combos.", "So she needs 0.18 x 326 =59

plan to fold if our opponent reraises us back.", "His 3-bet bluffs will still fold, and his strong hands will still shove.\nSo we win the same when he folds, but lose less on our bluffs when he doesn't fold.\nIn other words: We risk less for the same reward when we're bluffing, and we don't lose anything when we're 4-betting for value.\nWe simply choose 27bb as a representative value for a less-than-pot 4-bet, and the math won't change much if you use any number between 25bb and 30b instead.Here are a few assumptions/statements we will use:The last statement needs an explanation: When we're 3-betting/4-betting/5-betting as a bluff, we should not lose money on our bluffing hands, and the worst of them should be no worse than break even.", "Again, this results in our weakest bluffing/calling hands being no worse than break even.Under these assumptions, we'll find anwith a raising strategy (including defense against a 3-bet and against a 5-bet) for Alice, and a 3-betting

follow from Alice's opening range, but first, let's talk a bit about optimal strategy pairs:When our two players Alice and Bob are playing optimally against each other, Alice's strategy and Bob's strategy make up an optimal strategy pair.", "So when we pick hands for Bob's 3-bluffing range, we drop down to the \"cellar\" and pick hands that aren't god enough to 3-bet for value preflop, and not good enough to flat for postflop value.\nAgainst Alice, who either 4-bets or folds, it doesn't matter which hands we choose to 3-bet bluff with, since these hands will never see a flop.\nAlice either 4-bets or folds, and when she 4-bets, we 5-bet our value range all-in, and fold our 3-bet bluff range.\nBut in practice the choice of 3-bet bluff range matters a bit, since the raiser will sometimes call our 3-bet with his medium strong hands out of position and force us to play postflop.", "OK, enough about flatting.\nLet's move on and find Bob's 5-bet bluffs, and then his 3-bet bluffing range: We include 5-bet bluffs in Bob's value range Remember the definition of \"value range\" as the hands we 3-bet, planning to 5-bet all-in after a 4-bet.\nSome of these hands will be 5-bet bluffs, but for simplicity we'll refer to all the 5-betting hands as Bob's value range.\nFrom the previous theory section, we remember that Bob wants to have enough Axs 5-bet bluffs in his value range to make Alice's weakest value hands break even.\nThis accomplishes two things for Bob: He forces Alice to fold more of her 4-bet bluffs He makes it impossible for Alice to \"cheat\" by not paying off Bob's

range {QQ+, AK} =34 combos.\nWe'll use this value range example when we summarize Bob's optimal strategy below.\nAnd then we'll illustrate each strategy step thoroughly when we apply the theory to Alice's EP and CO openraises.\n2.4 Summary of Bob's optimal 3-betting strategy We summarize everything we have learned about Bob's optimal strategy for 3-betting and 5-betting: Bob starts by finding

A4s} =20 value combos that he 3-bets, planning to 5-bet all-in.\nThen he picks hands to 3-bet bluff until he has a 40/60 ratio between value combos and bluff combos.\nBob needs 60/40 =1.5 bluff combos

against a strong range, as shown below:So Bob will 5-bet a mix of true value hands and some Axs bluff hands, and he expects to have about 30% equity when his bluffs get called.\nSo when he 5-bet

combos (4.6% of all hands) This results in a total 3-bet range of 3.2 + 4.6 =7.8% against Alice's ~25% CO range.\nThe value/bluff ratio, using our numerical rounding, is 42/61, which is very close to the optimal 40/60.", "Our goal is that you learn to construct optimal strategy pair (one strategy for the raiser and one for the 3-bettor) based onopening ranges.\nAnd you will of course also be able to design optimal strategy pairs to use against specific opponents (not on the fly, but by doing a bit of analysis work between sessions).We use the following scenario:Note that Alice doesn't defend against 3-bets by calling out of position.\nWeconceivably design a defense strategy where we fold weak hands, 4-bet strong hands, and call with medium hands, but this is not a good strategy out of

our 3-bets, so 3-betting QQ/AK won't do anything for us.\nAgainst Alice we use QQ/AK as flatting hands, thus setting ourselves up for playing a raised pot in position against a range we have good equity against (Alice's total opening range, and not just her value hands).\nThis will give Alice (and the blinds, should they get involved) opportunities to make postflop mistakes that we can exploit.\nBut later in the article we'll let Alice open with a ~25% range from CO, and we'll see that QQ/AK now moves up to Bob's value range.\nAlice's value range is wider and weaker with a 25%

observing that Bob should 5-bet bluff enough to make Alice's weakest value hands break even.\nHe he bluffs more, Alice can gain by calling with more hands, and then Bob's strategy can't be optimal.\nAnd if he bluffs less, Alice can gain by folding more hands, and Bob's strategy can't be optimal in this case either.How many Axs hands we need to make Alice's weakest 5-bet calling hands

opening ranges.", "When Alice moves from EP to CO and her opening range changes from ~15% to ~25%, Bob responds by loosening up his 3-betting range dramatically.\nThis is an interesting observation.\nThose of you who use a more or less static 3-betting range (for example, the generic {JJ+, AQ} without any 3-bet bluffing that is recommended on many low limit forums) now have game theoretical \"proof\" that we can get away with a lot of 3-bet bluffing on the button against a CO raiser.\nEven against a TAG CO raiser with a solid ~25% opening range, you can 3-bet almost 8% on the button and there isn't anything he can do to exploit your loose 3-bets.", "We had to do a bit of work to construct all these ranges, but it was worth it, and we have learned a lot in the process.\nLet's see what Bob's optimal total 3-bet% is in this case: Value part: 20 combos (1.5% of all hands) Bluff part: Effectively 20% of 152 =30 combos (2.3% of all hands) This results in a total 3-bet% of 1.5 + 2.3 =3.8% against Alice's ~15% EP raises.\nHis value/bluff ratio is the desired optimal 20/30 =40/60.\nLater, when we construct an optimal strategy against Alice's 25% CO range, we'll see that Bob's 3-bet% skyrockets as a consequence of Alice raising a much wider opening range.", "Bob chooses value hands that are at least 50% against this range, and his pure value range becomes

AQ+}.\nAA and KK obviously belong in this range.\nTo see what else is included, we run equity calculations for the next tier of hands (QQ and AK): QQ and AK are barely above the threshold, while all weaker hands will be big underdogs.\nThus, Bob's pure value range is {QQ+, AK}, and he happily 3-bets these hands, and then 5-bets them all-in, purely for value.", "Examples of such hands are QQ-22, AK-AJ, KQ, QJs-T9s, etc.\n(and you can probably list some more if you think about it).\nSo should we 3-bet these medium strong hands as bluffs then?.\nNo, because they are too strong to turn into bluffs and waste their postflop value.\nThe alternative, which is a good one, is to flat-call with them and play a raised pot with position against a range we have god equity against (namely Alice's total opening range).\nOf course, we could always pretend they are trash and use them as 3-bet bluffs, but why should we do that when it's profitable to flat and play for postflop value?", "The same goes for when we're calling for pot odds.\nThis makes sense if you think about it.\nWhen we're making a play that loses money, we should stop doing it to increase our EV.Note that we're not concerned about the effects of deception when we work with game theory.\nWe're only concerned with immediate EV.\nAlso, if we're making money on all our bluffs or our calls, we can make even more money by bluffing more and calling more.\nSo we keep adding bluffs and calling hands until our weakest hands are at the break even point, and then we stop.\nConversely, if we're losing money on some of our bluffing or calling hands, we remove them from our ranges.", "And we do these things calmly, without emotion.\n4.\nOptimal strategy pairs for raiser/3-bettor with a CO raiser out of position After the thorough work with Alice raising ~15% in EP, we can now reap the rewards and quickly run through the same procedure with Alice raising a ~25% range in CO.

we have 20 value combos, and effectively 0.40 x 152 =61 bluff combos.\nThis means 20/(20 + 61) =25% of our 3-bets are for value, and 75% are bluffs.\nOur first adjustment to exploit this particular opponent is therefore to lower the optimal value/bluff ratio from the optimal 40/ to the more exploitative 25/75.\nThen we can also drop 5-bet-bluffing against this tight player, as discussed previously.\nThe simplest adjustment is to keep 3-betting our 5-bet bluffing hands A5s/A4s, but we move them from the value range down to the 3-bet bluff range, and fold them to a 4-bet.\nThe only hands we 5-bet against this player and his {QQ+, AK} 4-bet range is {KK+}, purely for value.", "But the core strategy for a typical TAG is to open somewhere around 15% of his hands (plus/minus a couple of percentage points in both directions) from both EP positions, and slightly tighter from UTG than from MP.\nWe'll construct all strategies/ranges with great detail for this scenario, so that there won't be any doubt about how to apply the theory.\nThen we'll move on to the scenario with Alice in CO, and do this quickly, with brief comments along the way.\n3.1 Alice's optimal raising strategy in EP (UTG and MP) We assume Alice is opening with a ~15% EP range.", "For example, when you come across an opponent who doesn't 4-bet bluff (and these are common at the low limits), you immediately know that this is a leak, and you know how to exploit it.\nTight and straightforward players who refuse to 4-bet bluff can be exploited by 3-betting a lot, and not 5-bet bluffing at all.\nYou can 3-bet a metric fuckton of bluff hands, and when they finally pick up a hand good enough to 4-bet, you fold all your bluffs and ship a tight value range (sometimes as tight as {KK+}).\nJust keep an eye on the other players to see if they are trying to exploit your loose 3-betting (tighten up a bit if they do), and you'll do very well in this spot.", "So let's begin defining Bob's optimal 3-bet/5-bet strategy in position against Alice's optimal raise/4-bet/call 5-bet strategy with a ~15% EP range: Bob's pure value range Bob knows that Alice EP range is ~15% (14% to be exact), and therefore he can draw the same conclusion Alice just did, namely that her optimal value 4-betting range is {QQ+, AK}.\nTo profitably 3-bet and 5-bet all-in for value against this range, Bob needs a hand with at least 50% equity.\nAA is obviously such a hand, and we can easily compute some equities to see that KK is the only other possible hand.\nSo Bob ends up with the super tight pure value range {KK+}.\nSo Bob will 3-bet {KK+} and 5-bet them all-in if Alice 4-bets.", "At any rate, Bob's final value 3-bet range (including his 5-bet bluffs) against Alice's optimally played ~15% EP range is {KK+, A5s, A4s}.\nBob's last job is to construct the 3-bet bluff range.\nThese are the hands we 3-bet, and always fold to a 4-bet.\nBob's 3-bet bluff range We remember the strength principle for poker hands: Bet/raise your strongest hands for value Check/call with your medium hands Fold/bluff with your weakest hands We have already defined Bob's value range (including 5-bet bluffs) as {KK+, A5s, A4s}, and we have mentioned that he also flats some range of good-but-not-great medium strong hands.\nAgainst Alice's ~15% EP range this means flatting with hands like QQ, JJ, TT, AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, etc.", "His value range also includes some 5-bet bluffs, and the next step is to find these.\nThen we pick a range of 3-bet bluffs that Bob plans to fold to a 4-bet.\nWe'll also talk about Bob's flatting range.\nThese are medium strong hands that are playable, but they are not strong enough to 4-bet for value,and they are too strong to use as bluffs, so Bob flat-calls with them.\nBob's flatting range can be viewed as a completely separate part of Bob's overall strategy, and we don't have to be concerned with it when constructing optimal ranges for 3-betting/4-betting/5-betting.\nBut we will discuss the flatting range briefly, since it helps us understand the big picture.", "When Alice has raised, Bob can respond in 3-ways: He can 3-bet (for value or as a bluff), he can flat, or he can fold.\nDifferent hands have different jobs to do within these ranges.\nAnd depending on Alice's opening range, hands can move between Bob's 3-betting/flatting/folding ranges.\nFor example, we'll see that AK isn't strong enough to be a value hand for Bob against Alice's EP range, so AK goes into the flatting range in this scenario.\nBut when Alice opens a much wider ~25% range in CO, AK is promoted to a value hand that is 3-bet and 5-bet for value.\nMore about that later in the article.", "When two good and aggressive NLHE-players engage in 3-bet/4-bet/5-bet warfare preflop, this is what usually happens: Both players operate with wide ranges, and all ranges have a significant percentage of bluffs in them, especially at the early stage (raising and 3-betting) Both players are willing to fold most of their bluffs (but not all of them), when their opponent reraises them back This results in ranges that start loose, but get more and more (but never completely) weighted towards value.\nAnd it's usually plain wrong to assume you can 4-bet a medium hand like AJs for value against a loose 3-bettor, and expect to be a favorite when he 5-bets all-in.", "The right man for the right job.\nBob will therefore flat QQ, AK and various other medium strong hands/implied odds hands after a ~15% open-raise from Alice.\nThe optimal flatting range depends on how Bob thinks Alice plays postflop, what he thinks the players in the blinds will do, how they play postflop, their stack sizes, etc.\nSo we leave the construction of an optimal flatting range to Bob.\nNote that 3-betting QQ and AK for value against a ~15% EP raiser is equivalent to assuming the raiser isn't playing optimally.\nIf you feel these two hands can always be 3-bet and 5-bet all-in for value against this EP range, you can assume it's because the players you meet don't defend well against 3-bets out of position.", "And if he defends poorly, for example by not 4-bet-bluffing enough, or not being willing to use JJ/AQ as value hands, you can deviate from optimal play and attack him even harder.\nThe first adjustment against a weak/passive CO raiser who folds a lot to 3-bets is to increase your fixed 3-bet bluff percentage for the candidate list.\nYou might increase the bluff candidate 3-betting frequency from 40% to 60%.\nIf Villain (and the blinds) doesn't adjust to your exploitative, loose 3-betting, you'll be printing money.\n5.\nSummary We have gone through the theory for game theory optimal(ish) raising/3-betting/4-betting/5-betting with the raiser out of position, and then we demonstrated how the theory can be implemented and used at the table.", "I hope you'll see that these strategies aren't really complicated to construct and then apply at the table.We'll now find the optimal strategy pair for Alice and Bob when Alice open-raises from early position (EP =UTG or MP), and it's folded to Bob in position.It's of course possible to vary EP opening ranges a lot, according to opponent tendencies and general game conditions.\nBut the core strategy for a typical TAG is to open somewhere around 15% of his hands (plus/minus a couple of percentage points in both directions) from both EP positions, and slightly tighter from UTG than from MP.We'll construct all strategies/ranges with great detail for this scenario, so that there won't be any doubt about how to apply the theory.", "Note that the combination of a candidate list of 3-bet bluff hands and a fixed (but adjustable) bluff% to use with these hands, gives us a lot of flexibility to adjust our 3-bet bluffing as we please.\nAgainst an unknown opponent, we can start with the optimal 20% frequency, and 3-bet {KK+, A5s, A4s} always, and the candidate list 20% of the time.\nBut if we note that the raiser doesn't defend optimally, we might want to adjust this bluff percentage.\nFor example, of the raiser never 4-bet bluffs and only 4-bets a tight value range like {QQ+, AK}, we can go bananas with our 3-bet bluffs.\nWe might decide to double the bluff frequency from 20% to 40% for our list of 152 bluff candidate combos.", "Under these assumptions, we'll find an optimal strategy pair with a raising strategy (including defense against a 3-bet and against a 5-bet) for Alice, and a 3-betting strategy (including defense against a 4-bet) for Bob.\nWe'll find a unique strategy pair for each of Alice's positions (e.g.\nfor each of her opening ranges).\nWe'll soon see how these strategy pairs follow from Alice's opening range, but first, let's talk a bit about optimal strategy pairs: What is an optimal strategy pair?\nWhen our two players Alice and Bob are playing optimally against each other, Alice's strategy and Bob's strategy make up an optimal strategy pair.", "We have now specified Alice's optimal EP strategy for for raising/4-betting/calling a 5-bet when she gets 3-bet by a player in position.\nOur next step is to turn to Bob.\nWhat is Bob's optimal strategy for 3-betting/5-betting in position after a ~15% EP raise from Alice?\n3.2 Bob's optimal 3-bet-strategy versus Alice's optimal raising strategy in EP We're assuming Bob knows Alice's opening range (he only needs to know the % of hands, not the specific hands), either from observation, or by using a HUD.\nAlice's raise percentage dictates her value 4-bet range, which dictates Bob's strategies for 3-betting and 5-betting.\nBob starts by finding the hands that he 3-bets and 5-bets all-in, purely for value.", "Another leak you'll see is spazzy 4-betting from players with insufficient understanding of the theory behind optimal 3-bet/4-bet/5-bet wars.\nThis might happen when you have driven someone crazy with your loose 3-betting, and he starts to tilt.\nOr when someone tries to fight back in a controlled manner, but he doesn't quite know how to do it (so he starts 4-bet bluffing way too much).\nThe first thing you have to realize when you are playing optimally, and then spotting a leak, is this: It's not necessary to deviate from optimal play to benefit from his mistakes.\nIf you keep playing optimally, and your opponent doesn't, you will win from him in the long run, period.", "With these concepts at the back of our mind, we move on to the mathematics behind optimal strategies for raising, 3-betting, 4-betting, and 5-betting with 100bb stacks: 2.2 How opening ranges, 3-betting ranges, 4-betting ranges, and 5-betting ranges are connected mathematically We work our way through the raise/3-bet/4-bet/5-bet war, one step at a time, and construct all the mathematical tools we need.\nWe jump back and forth between Alice and Bob, and we'll see how they influence each others' strategies when they both are trying to play perfectly against each other, assuming the other player is also trying to play perfectly.", "1.3 Background material for the article Before we get started, I want to give credit to Cardrunners instructor Matthew Janda.\nDuring the spring of 2010 he published a 3-part video series Optimal Preflop Play I-III at Stoxpoker, which contains most of the theory we use in this article.\nThis video series was inspiring and eye-opening, but sadly it became unavailable after Stoxpoker shut down in May 2010.\nMatt Janda is now a Cardrunners instructor, and he continues to produce game theory related videos.\nHis old videos from Stoxpoker might get moved over to Cardrunners, and if that happens, I recommend you check them out.\nWithout further ado, let's get started: 2.", "Hero open-raised AJs (correctly), and he got 3-bet.\nHe then decided that his AJs was a good hand against Villain's 3-bet range (debatable, but not a big mistake), so he 4-bet for value (wrong!\n), planning to call a 5-bet all-in.\nPlaying AJs for value after a 3-bet and going all-in with it was a big mistake.\nThe 4-bet in itself was not a big mistake, since Villain has a lot of bluffs in his 3-betting range, and he will fold most of them to a 4-bet.\nSo it's not a problem to 4-bet AJs as a bluff against a range full of 3-bet bluffs.", "Hero open-raised AJs (correctly),

who play close to these ranges.\nIf you need to apply the theory to other ranges, just plug them into the method, and construct the strategy pairs yourself.\nWe didn't look at small blind vs big blind in this article, even if it falls under the same category with the raiser out of position.\nI elected to leave this situation out, since blind vs blind dynamics is very dependent on the players involved, and the history between them.\nSo it's difficult (and probably not very useful) to try and generalize and assign SB a standard opening range.", "And he is unlikely to change that plan, even if Bob's exploitative response is to drop all 5-bet bluffs from his value range, and only 5-bet-shove {KK+}, purely for value.\nThese things happen because a) people are blinded by seemingly strong hands, even after they get trapped in situations where their hands suddenly aren't strong anymore, and b) because people are reluctant to change their initial plan, even after if becomes clear it's a bad plan.\nAgainst an opponent who makes the dual mistake of not 4-betting bluffing enough, and also paying off our value 5-bets too much, Bob can gain a lot from not having to think about 5-bet bluffing.", "We could conceivably design a defense strategy where we fold weak hands, 4-bet strong hands, and call with medium hands, but this is not a good strategy out of position with 100bb stacks.\nYou have poor implied odds (due to low stack/pot ratio and being out of position) when you call for postflop value with implied odds hands.\nAnd it's difficult to steal and outplay Villain when you are out of position.\nAnd what you absolutely cannot do, is to call and then play fit-or-fold postflop.\nIt will be much more fold than fit, and you are simply burning money by letting Villain c-bet his way to riches and early retirement on your expense.", "We now begin the job of constructing optimal strategy pairs for Alice and Bob.\nFirst when Alice raises a 15% range from EP, and then when she raises a 25% range from CO.
