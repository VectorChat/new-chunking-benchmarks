["October 25, 1965 looked like a beautiful morning for the planned double launch.\nThe Agena would go up first to set up the conditions of the rendezvous.\nWally Schirra and Tom Stafford waited in their Gemini for the second launch.\nThe Agena launch went smoothly.\nThe Atlas booster separated from the automated spacecraft on schedule and the Agena lit its engine.\nThen, the data on FIDO\u2019s console stopped updating.\nThey had lost contact with the Agena.\nThe Gemini 6 countdown continued until Range Safety reported debris falling into the ocean.\nWhen it became obvious that the Agena had exploded, Kranz\u2019s team decided that there was no point in launching the Gemini and called it a day.\nThat evening\u2019s Judo match gave both Kranz and Llewellyn a chance to vent their frustrations, and then they retreated to the Singing Wheel.\nThis was the controllersfavorite bar, where they celebrated successes and mourned losses.\nFor a little while, it looked like Gemini 6 wasn\u2019t going to happen.\nThen, somebody had an inspired idea.\nGemini 7 was going to go up before too long.\nWhy not make it the target vehicle for the Gemini 6 rendezvous?\nThough neither side in the Space Race had mastered rendezvous yet, the Russians had already demonstrated their capacity for running two missions at once.\nCould the Americans do the same?\nThey were certainly going to find out and Gemini 6 and 7 came to be known collectively as Gemini 7/6.", "Gemini 5 splashed down with a duration record under their belts and Mission Control began to look ahead to their first attempt at rendezvous and docking.\nThe planned star of the show was an automated spacecraft called Agena.\nSome of the MCC controllers were less than impressed, especially after one ground test in which faulty software sent every available command to the Agena.\nIf this had happened during an actual mission, they would have been in big trouble.\nTheir disparaging comments would turn out to be accurate.", "\u201cWe got our crew home safely and the control teams did a damn fine job under real-time pressure.\nI know this is going to sound like Monday morning quarterbacking, but the lessons from the mission are how we screwed up in planning and training.\n\u201cThe crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong.\nWe failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked, they must be considered as one spacecraft, one integrated power system, and a single structure.\n\u201cThe next thing is that many of us did not trust the Agena.\nBrooks\u2019s team thought it was a great piece of hardware.\nIf we don\u2019t trust a spacecraft, we have to fix it.\nWe were lucky, too damned lucky, and we must never forget this mission\u2019s lessons.\u201d They were all lessons that would serve them well during the Apollo 13 crisis.\nFor the moment, they made the necessary changes and went forward into preparations for Gemini 9.\nIt would be Gene Kranz\u2019s last Gemini mission before he moved over to the Apollo project.", "The crew rendezvoused with the ATDA on the third orbit and confirmed Mission Control\u2019s suspicions about the shroud.\nIt was only partly open and held in place by a band.\n\u201cIt looks like an angry alligator,\u201d reported Stafford.\nMission Control sent several rapid maneuver commands in an attempt to jettison the shroud with no luck.\nIn the meantime, the Gemini left the Agena, orbited Earth one more time, and returned for a second rendezvous.\nA brainstorming session by the ATDA team failed to come up with any workable ideas.\nStafford suggested using the nose of the Gemini to nudge the shroud off and Kranz was quick to veto that idea.\nFor the time being, Kranz\u2019s team gave up on trying to get the shroud off.\nKranz went home for supper and to get some fresh clothes to bring back to MCC quarters.\nWhen he got back, he found out that somebody had come up with an idea of doing an EVA to release the shroud and went down to the ready room to see what he could find out.\nSome of NASA\u2019s top staffers were there.", "The official investigation would reveal that the fire had started somewhere near Gus Grissom\u2019s seat.\nThere was some speculation that Grissom could have done something to cause the fire, which the controllers and engineers who were most involved in the project thought was pure nonsense.\nThe fire had started in an area that Grissom couldn\u2019t reach from his seat, even by accident.", "The oxygen flow to the fuel cells dropped to alarming levels during the first orbit.\nThinking fast, the crew abandoned the planned rendezvous maneuver and powered down equipment.\nKraft could have aborted the mission right then, but decided to give it a few more orbits to troubleshoot and see if the oxygen levels began to level out.\nTo be on the safe side, Kraft had recovery teams redeployed to emergency landing areas.\nThe White Team began to move into place to back up Kraft\u2019s Red Team.\nThe fuel cell situation began to stabilize, but it was obvious that they weren\u2019t able to operate at full power and some of the experiments were canceled.", "Having only two shifts for a mission was a staffing mistake they never made again.\nBy the time the launch day for Gemini 8 arrived, Kranz and Hodge were both exhausted from planning, training, mission reviews and press conferences.\nThe crew, Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott, were going to rendezvous and dock with an Agena.\nThe Agena control team was made up of novices but was balanced out by an experienced Gemini team.\nThis time, Hodge\u2019s team got both the Agena and the Gemini on their way smoothly.\nThe crew and Mission Control were preparing for final rendezvous maneuvers when the White Team came on duty.\nMission Control and the remote sites used timed-tagged stored program commands (SPC) to control the unmanned Agena.\nBecause the Agena spacecraft had given them so many problems, nobody was taking any chances that it might misinterpret a command and go wild.\nThe Agena had an error checking routine that helped controllers verify that the command being put in the onboard computer\u2019s memory was the one they had sent.\nAs a backup, the remote site computers performed an echo check by automatically recording each command as it was converted into radio waves and checking it with the intended command load.\nIf the telemetry from the Agena\u2019s error checking routine failed, controllers could perform a manual check that would take several hours or save time by basing their decisions on the echo check.", "Hodge\u2019s Blue Team had been on duty for eleven hours and was exhausted, so Hodge asked Kranz to take over.\nKranz called in his White Team and contacted recovery forces.\nGemini 8 was going to come down in an area not covered by the recovery network.\nArmstrong wasn\u2019t very happy about having to abort and spend time floating in the western Pacific Ocean but started the reentry procedures.\nGemini 8 lasted only ten hours and forty-one minutes but the rookie Agena team got two more days to practice controlling the Agena.\nThough Gemini 8 had been abortive, NASA had learned some important lessons.\nGene Kranz summed it up at the debriefing.", "Gemini 8 was only half an orbit from rendezvousing with the Agena when the CapCom on Rose Knot reported that they had lost the automatic data comparison on the Agena.\nThe Agena systems engineer tried to rerun it, and then began printing out the memory data for the manual check.\nThe echo check looked okay, so Gemini 8 approached the Agena as planned, Rose Knot gave everything one last check, and the controllers gave the Go for docking.\nThe Americans scored their second space first when Armstrong reported, \u201cWe\u2019re docked, no noticeable oscillations, very smooth.\u201d Everything seemed to be going well, though CapCom Jim Lovell decided that Armstrong and Scott should be informed of the failed load comparison.\nA military coup in Zanzibar had forced NASA to move the remote station over to Madagascar and Gemini 8 was making a pass over it when Lovell told them, \u201cIf the Agena attitude control system goes wild, just send the command to turn it off and take control of the spacecraft.\u201d Everything looked normal when Gemini 8 flew into a zone of no coverage.\nWhen they regained contact, Armstrong and Scott were rolling at a rate of one complete rotation per second.\nAt that rate, they risked blacking out.\nThe roll had started when they were still docked to the Agena and they had undocked, thinking something had gone wrong with the automated spacecraft.\nAs it turned out, one of their own thrusters was stuck open.\nArmstrong drained the orbital fuel trying to get the Gemini back under control and had to fire the reentry thrusters to stop the roll.\nThey would have to come back home.", "White came back through the hatch and they wrestled to get the hatch closed.\nIt had lost its flexibility in the cold of space.\nMission Control had planned to jettison the now unnecessary EVA gear but decided not to press their luck.\nWith that done, Chris Kraft turned the flight director\u2019s chair over to Gene Kranz.\n\u201cYoung man, it\u2019s yours.\u201d Kranz donned his white vest for the first time to a mixed reaction.\nVon Ehrenfried rolled his eyes and couldn\u2019t resist needling his boss.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, they\u2019re going to haul you away and then I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d The needling didn\u2019t stop there.\nKranz suddenly found himself the center of the closed-circuit TV cameras and several controllers commented, \u201cNice vest, Flight!\u201d The next day, pictures of Kranz in his spiffy white vest were featured in newspapers across the country.", "Kranz considered the plan too risky and had his suspicions about who was behind it.\nBuzz Aldrin was one of the more loudly opinionated astronauts and had picked up the nickname of \u201cDr.\nRendezvous\u201d for his attempts to assist with rendezvous planning.\nHe was in the middle of explaining how the EVA might be done.\nKranz explained to the top players in the room that there was a lot of energy stored up in the shroud\u2019s release mechanism and Cernan would have nothing to latch onto while he worked.\nNewtonian physics applied while in orbit and just using a screwdriver could send him spinning if he had nothing to hold onto.\nIf that thing came off with Cernan nearby, they stood a chance of losing one astronaut.\nNASA didn\u2019t need that kind of poor publicity.", "Some of the readouts suggested that the Segment 51 was a false alarm, but they couldn\u2019t be certain.\nGlenn was troubleshooting some attitude control problems while Mission Control tried to make sense of the data they were getting from the remote sites.\nOnly about half those sites were seeing the Segment 51.\nSome of the design techs suggested making sure the landing bag switch was off and asking Glenn whether he had heard any banging noises when he maneuvered.\nWalt Williams and two of the designers joined Chris Kraft at his console and suggested leaving the retropack on during reentry in the hope it would keep the heat shield in place.\nKraft was convinced it was a false reading and didn\u2019t like that very much.\nWilliams asked, \u201cIf we come in with the retropack attached, what\u2019s the worst that could happen to us?\u201d Kranz could imagine Glenn\u2019s response if he could have heard that question: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018us\u2019?\u201d After a little more discussion, it was decided that they would keep an eye on it, but not to tell John Glenn because they didn\u2019t want to worry him.\nLeaving the retropack on could work, but only if all three retro rockets fired on time.\nIf they didn\u2019t, there was a chance one of the rockets could go off during reentry and kill Glenn.", "Some intermittent communications problem gave Kraft\u2019s team headaches and caused Grissom to growl, \u201cHow can we get to the moon if we can\u2019t even talk between two buildings?\u201d They could have called it a day, but decided to give it another hour.\nThen, shouts from the cockpit sent chills down everybody\u2019s spine.", "The ATDA launch went well but the controller for this new automated spacecraft reported that it was guzzling fuel and the adapter shroud might not have opened fully.\nA command shut down the ATDA\u2019s attitude control jets.\nIf the shroud hadn\u2019t opened fully, they might not be able to dock but that was a secondary objective.\nA failure in the ground support equipment forced them to scrub the Gemini launch for two days.", "The ground crew moved swiftly through the launch kill procedures.\nThe Titan\u2019s systems detected that launch hadn\u2019t occurred and engines shut down automatically.\nInspections revealed that an umbilical had released prematurely and a dust cover also hadn\u2019t been removed.\nSome people may have thought of \u201cThe Four-Inch Flight,\u201d in which a power cord had also caused a premature shutdown by disconnecting early.\nOnce again, they were lucky.\nThe ground crew went through an efficient turnaround and they were ready for the next launch window just three days later.", "The crew were Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom, Gemini 4 Spacewalker Ed White and a rookie astronaut named Roger Chaffee.\nAt 1:00 pm, they were sealed into the spacecraft.\nKranz volunteered to lead the MCC team participating in this test and was in his office before sunrise.\nThe Apollo program director had been complaining about the MCC\u2019s readiness and especially their computer systems, so Kraft sent a memo to Kranz telling him to get his systems people to quit their \u201cgold-plating\u201d and justify their requirements.\nKranz sent back a quick acknowledgement and went to get the MCC ready.\nControllers started to arrive for the test at about 11:00 a.m.\nThey were all sick of the amount of testing by this point and John Hodge griped to Kranz, \u201cI sure hope things go well today.\nWe need to get going on our own work.\u201d Kranz just handed over the logbook, went down to his office to get a little work done, and then knocked off early to beat the rush hour traffic.\nThe crew received their \u201cgo\u201d to enter the capsule.\nGrissom plugged his suit into the oxygen supply and immediately reported a sour smell.\nHodge paused the countdown for air sampling and the countdown resumed at 1:25 p.m. Chris Kraft had planned to head up his Red Team for the launch and went down to the MCC for the planned handover.\nHodge decided to hang around in case the test dragged on as it had for some of the plugs-in work.", "Problems developed in the thrusters and seat tests and Kraft dived into the task of insuring that the control team was ready for any contingency.\nHe was still the senior flight director and gave Kranz the authority to do the same with his team.\nKranz assured him that he was already on the job.\nThen, Kranz got his first real test in his new role of flight director when Kraft became practically bedridden with influenza six days before the launch.\nThe job of handling the final simulation, pad tests and pre-launch briefings fell on Kranz\u2019s lap.\nThere was a chance that Kranz would have to step into Kraft\u2019s place for the launch and he was so nervous that he clipped out a Sports Illustrated picture of a woman in a swimsuit for emotional support.\nKraft recovered enough to cover the actual launch and Kranz stepped back to his original role of insuring that the control teams and data network were ready.\nIt was one of the few unmanned shots covered by reporters in the control room and Kranz thought it was a bit much for an unmanned suborbital shot that had become nearly routine in the Mercury days.\nThere were so many cameras in the room that a fuse blew, plunging them into darkness.\nThis was where blindfold drills came in handy.\nKranz worked by feel and the mission came off reasonably well for the fact that they weren\u2019t really prepared for a power failure in the control center.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston adapted its electrical systems so that wouldn\u2019t happen in the future and camera crews were required to provide their own power when covering future space missions.", "Then, somebody screamed and they heard nothing else.\nEfforts to get them out took several minutes and they found the crew in a heap next to the hatch.\nThey had obviously been trying to undo it but simply couldn\u2019t in time.", "He was overridden and, even worse, Chris Kraft had done nothing to back him up.\nFurious, Kranz threatened to quit after the mission was over.\nKraft shrugged it off and ordered him to get the job done.\nHowever, Kranz still had one trump card.\nNo one could override a flight director when he was directing a mission in real time.\nIf it seemed like Cernan was having any kind of trouble, Kranz would wave him off.\nEven so, he spent a sleepless night going over possibilities.\nThe safest approach seemed to be taking some medical scissors to the lanyard.\nGemini 9 was just completing the third planned rendezvous when the White Team came back on duty.\nThe crew ended up saving Kranz from having to make a choice.\nThey were already exhausted and getting low on fuel.\nThey wanted to save the EVA for the next day.\nConsidering the circumstances, this was the equivalent of canceling it altogether.\nCapCom looked to Kranz for direction and a relieved Kranz gave him a thumbs-up.\n\u201cFlight concurs.\u201d Kranz had recently been offered a chance to return to test flight and would likely have done so if they had gone ahead with the plan to release the shroud.\nHe had dodged a bullet.\nCernan went on to make the planned EVA.\nEven without going over to the Agena, it was a surprisingly tough job and he wore himself out just getting to the backpack stowed in a compartment outside the Gemini.\nHe was drenched with sweat and the evaporation fogged up his visor, blinding him.\nNASA physician Chuck Berry recommended rest breaks that didn\u2019t help much.\nCernan didn\u2019t need any prodding to give it up.", "Gene Kranz had just gotten dressed for a night out with his wife when he got a knock on the door.\nHe thought it was just the baby-sitter, so he called, \u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming.\u201d He went downstairs and the man at the door was flight controller Jim Hannigan.\n\u201cThey had a fire on the launchpad.\nThey think the crew is dead!\u201d Kranz turned on the TV to see what the reporters had found out so far.\nIt wasn\u2019t much.\nChris Kraft had acted quickly to lock down Mission Control so they could investigate.\nEnvisioning explosions and an inferno that consumed the entire pad, he rushed to the Center and had trouble finding a parking space.\nEvery available controller was reporting in to see what they could do to help.\nThe controllers still in the control room were too stunned to say much.\nThose still capable of focusing were going over data at their stations.\nMost of the rest were milling around, trying to make sense of the tragedy.\n\u201cIt was gruesome,\u201d was all John Hodge could get out.\nChris Kraft was on the phone with Deke Slayton.\nSlayton described fire spewing out from inside the capsule and molten metal running down the sides.\nThere was nothing more they could do for the crew.\nThey had lost three pilots in the worst way imaginable, in a ground test that shouldn\u2019t have been much of a risk.\nMost thought it had taken only seconds.\nIt was a harsh reminder of the hazards of space flight.\nKranz organized a meeting of his branch and flight control team in a nearby auditorium.\nAt Hodge\u2019s request, he also included the civil servants, Philco controllers and spacecraft contractors.", "The last orbit was the worst.\nThe controllers had no new data and they were trying to troubleshoot without letting Glenn know that he could be in serious trouble.\nGlenn figured out that something was up anyway and tried to get them to tell him what it was.\nWhen he returned to dry land, he would tell the controllers exactly what he thought of not having all the information available.\nAs it was, Glenn\u2019s response to the retropack plan was pretty tart: \u201cWhat is the reason for this?\nDo you have a reason?\nOver.\u201d Shepard finally told him that they weren\u2019t sure whether the landing bag had deployed.\nAll three retro rockets fired on time and, as Glenn reentered, the Friendship 7 was surrounded by an ion buildup that blocked radio signals.\nIt was a tense wait for the people in Mission Control and those watching the live coverage of the mission.\nFinally, the spacecraft was spotted by the recovery ship USS Noa.\nJohn Glenn was brought on board to the cheers of the Noa\u2018s crew and got a taste of the nation-wide celebration to come when his route back to Cape Canaveral ended with an impromptu parade through the nearby Cocoa Beach.\nThe telemetry readings of the Segment 51 would turn out to be false.\nThe comrades in Mission Control celebrated with a big bash that night.", "Marta made a special vest with gold and silver brocade over the familiar white for the next launch attempt.\nIt made an impression on visitors on June 3 and Kraft even made a few kidding comments.\nIt may have been a good luck charm.\nEither way, the launch was successful that day.", "NASA procedure also called for nearly all communications between the crew and the ground to be available to the press.\nTo allow for limited private communications, Mission Control worked out a workaround code called UHF-6.\nIf either the ground or the crew requested a UHF-6 test, a private loop would be set up with a surgeon in the back room and the surgeon would privately brief the flight director afterwards.\nThe press was typically nosy, however, and Kranz tried to give them a runaround with highly technical jargon about communications and antenna.\nThat failed and he was forced to admit defeat.", "Rescue personnel found an annoyed Carpenter munching on a candy bar.\nCarpenter was heard to comment, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d That made Llewellyn mad.\n\u201cThat SOB is lucky to be alive.\u201d From then on, whenever someone wanted to get Llewellyn to tell the story, all they had to do was repeat the line, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was and they didn\u2019t either.\u201d Kranz felt that a combination of a distracted crewman, too many scientific experiments, and ground crew taking too long to remind him of checklists had almost cost them an astronaut.\nThey had gotten lucky, but Kranz wanted to eliminate luck as a factor in future space flights.\nIn any case, Carpenter would go on to participate in Sealab and never flew a space mission again.", "\u201cThey were going to send a dog.\nBut they decided that would be too cruel.\u201d", "The Aftermath", "\u201cSpaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity and neglect.\nSomewhere, somehow, we screwed up.\nIt could have been in design, build or test.\nWhatever it was, we should have caught it.\n\u201cWe were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw in each day of our work.\nEvery element of the program was in trouble and so were we.\nThe simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed Daily.\nNothing we did had any shelf life.\nNot one of us stood up and said, \u2018Dammit, stop!\u201cI don\u2019t know what Thompson\u2019s committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find.\nWe are the cause!\nWe were not ready!\nWe did not do our job!\nWe were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when we knew in our hearts it would take a miracle.\nWe were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did.", "\u201cFire!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fire in the cockpit!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bad fire, get us out!\nWe\u2019re burning up.\u201d", "They had only two months to prepare for Gemini 9 and Kranz was forced to make an unpopular move.\nHe declared that there would be no holidays or vacations.\nSome of the controllerswives were quite annoyed and let him know about it.\nHe stuck to his guns and explained that astronautslives were on the line every time they sat on top of one of those rockets.\nDuring a launch, controllers had to be capable of making split-second decisions.\nWhenever a controller made a mistake in simulations, the worst that would happen was that he would get teased about it at the end of the day.\nIf it happened during a mission, the astronauts might not make it home.\nThe crew for Gemini 9 was Gene Cernan and Tom Stafford.\nCernan was one of the few early astronauts who had served a role other than CapCom in Mission Control.\nHe had been a booster tank monitor for the first four Gemini missions and the controllers easily accepted him into their ranks.\nHe did most of the talking for the 9 crew.\nStafford was the quiet one of the two and generally kept his opinions to himself.\nTheir first launch attempt on May 17, 1966 was a bust when the curse of the Agena struck again and pieces of it fell into the Atlantic Ocean.\nSo they pulled out a new backup rendezvous vehicle called the augmented target docking adopter (ATDA), the mission was renamed Gemini 9A for the sake of bureaucracy and they scheduled the next launch attempt for June 1.", "move his upper body and could only communicate with the help of fellow controller Bob Carlton.\nThe launch went smoothly, and then they ran into two alarms at once.\nDPS DELTA V

had not been executed.\nThey extended the mission by an orbit to see if they could still accomplish all their goals.\nSending commands went from being a hassle to being a major problem due to poor signal strength.\nThe controllers ended up punching in commands manually.\nKranz did not want to lose the test of the LM\u2019s abort system, so he decided to ditch all the other tests if he absolutely had to and focus on that one.\nThe command was sent up and Kranz heard the welcome news from Carlton: \u201cFire-in-the-hole, abort stage, we are stable!\u201d Their struggles with the commands had done some damage to the LM but they accomplished all the important objectives.\nBecause of their success, newspapers were able to report the happy news: \u201cApollo Mission A Success,

fired the retros a few seconds late, but that was the biggest concern.", "They cut a deal that would work for the short-term.\nHunter would be in charge of the station, and Conrad would be in charge

bad that Chris Kraft gave Kranz a call.\n\u201cI listened to your runs today.\nSounds like you had a tough time.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kranz assured his boss that his team was only having a bad day and would get through it with more training and revisions of the mission rules.\nThings did improve for a while.\nA readiness review on June 17 revealed only one issue that sparked a debate that would last until the week before the launch.\nChris Kraft brought up the issue of landing data rules.\nMost controllers had made a bad call based on faulty telemetry data at some point during training.\nWould they be able to get enough telemetry data to make a decision on landing?\nKranz finally solved the issue by adding a mission rule: \u201cThe flight director will determine if", "Gemini 6 was a success and came home the next day.\nAt the press conference, the reporters played a gotcha on Gene Kranz by bringing along a bottle of what they claimed was champagne for a toast.\nIt turned out to be Canada Dry ginger ale.\nGemini 7 went on to set an American endurance record that would stand until Skylab eight years later.\nAfter the success of Gemini 7/6, many of the controllers began to move over to Apollo, draining the Gemini team enough that Mission Control decided to go with a two-shift rotation for Gemini 8.", "Now who in the world would be playing a recording of comedian Bill Dana\u2019s cowardly astronaut routine at a time like this?\nKranz scrambled to find the cause.\nIf it was coming from anywhere in this room, he was history.\nBut, as it turned out, the launch pad crew were piping it into Shepard\u2019s spacecraft in an attempt to get him to lighten up.\nIt certainly added to the surreal feeling and got grins from a few people in Mission Control.\nFinally, the countdown resumed and reached zero at 9:34 am Eastern standard time.\nKranz was so excited that, when he left his station to go over to the Teletype machine, he forgot to remove his headset.\nThe cord snagged a chair and knocked it over.\nHe picked it up just as Shepard made his thirty-second report.\nThe Freedom 7 reached an apogee of 116 miles and Shepard tested roll, pitch and yaw manuevers as planned.\nThis assured the doctors whom Kranz considered too conservative that humans could function in space.\nFifteen minutes after launch, Shepard splashed down and was soon aboard recovery ship USS Lake Champlain.\nDuring NASA\u2019s early missions, only Public Relations chief Shorty Powers ever used the phrase \u201cA-OK\u201d during a mission and, years later, Kranz admitted that it was accurate if a little too Hollywood.", "leash.\nCharlie Duke joined the team as Kranz\u2019s CapCom.\nHe integrated with the team so well that Kranz thought that he would have made an excellent flight director.\nWhile establishing the mission rules, Bill Tindall livened things up with his Tindallgrams.\nA typical Tindallgram might read: \u201cThere is another thing about powered descent crew procedures that really bugged me.\nJust call me \u2018Aunt Emma\u2019; certainly some smart people may laugh at my concern, but I just feel that the crew should not be diddling around with the computer keyboard during powered descent unless absolutely necessary.\nThey will never hit a wrong button, of course, but if they do, the results can be really lousy.\u201d Many of his Tindallgram ideas were incorporated into the mission rules, including changing the Go/NoGo decisions to Stay/NoStay for actual lunar activity.\nFor his efforts, Bill Tindall became an honorary flight director with Gray as a team color and Kranz invited Tindall to sit beside him for the lunar landing.\nTraining started eight weeks before the planned launch date.\nThey ran through the planned mission for the first couple of days to identify major Go/NoGo points and get a feel for what a \u201cnormal\u201d mission with no problems would be.\nA new SimSup named Dick Koos continued the tradition of imaginative simulation scripts that helped the control team refine procedures and mission rules.\nNot everything went perfectly.\nThe crew and controllers often trained together and that meant the computer network between the control room and crew simulators needed to stay up and running.\nWhen it didn\u2019t, SimSup", "Some people at the Cape weren\u2019t too thrilled with the idea of a dual mission, mostly because it added quite a bit of complexity to their normal work.\nMSC chief Robert Gilruth was a quick convert and a review by Kranz\u2019s team revealed no problems that they couldn\u2019t solve or work around.\nThe Gemini 7 crew, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, welcomed the idea.\nThey were up for a two-week mission in a spacecraft that wasn\u2019t very big and the rendezvous would give them a break in the monotony.\nThe plan was to launch Gemini 7 and promptly swing into action to prepare the same pad for the launch of Gemini 6.\nThe pad and the surrounding area would be checked for debris.\nThe pad would be checked for damage, and then the Titan with the Gemini 6 spacecraft on top would be brought out to the pad and inspected.\nIf everything went smoothly, Gemini 6 would launch one week after Gemini 7.", "Kranz\u2019s family was still growing.\nMarta gave birth to their fourth child, a boy, and the residents of Flight Controller Alley ganged

Mission Control Center.", "Hodge started the meeting with a briefing that included the information they knew so far.\nThen, Kranz took the podium.\nHe had gone from shock to anger and wanted to say

keep him on task.\nI think he\u2019s delirious.\u201d Though California gave him the countdown for firing the retro-rockets, Carpenter hit the button three seconds too late.\nHe was going to land somewhere past the planned landing area.\nIt was questionable whether he could even get into the proper attitude for reentry and he would have to use the fly-by-wire system to keep his spacecraft from tumbling.\nLlewellyn resorted to high school geometry to determine that Carpenter was going to land at least 200 miles long.\nAs Carpenter began coming back into the atmosphere and they lost radio contact, all the people in the control room could do was pray.\nKranz had only felt this kind of helplessness when he held his wife\u2019s hand during childbirth.\nFinally, Grissom caught Carpenter\u2019s report that his chute had deployed and replied that they would get Air Rescue personnel to him within an hour.", "The suits might have been lightweight, but Borman and Lovell had a repeat of Scott Carpenter\u2019s suit heating problems during Aurora 7.\nWhen the crew reached Day 3 with little relief, Lovell stripped off his suit.\nMission Control wanted to let both of them remove their suits when medical data showed that Lovell was sleeping better, but NASA management refused to allow it.\nControl even tried playing the media card and told the press that the crew risked overheating in those suits to no avail.\nBorman and Lovell had to take turns wearing the suits.", "Launch day started even earlier for Gene Kranz than for Alan Shepard.\nHe left the hotel shortly after midnight, carpooling with MCC RETRO Carl Huss.\nHussappearance and habits reminded many of his colleagues of a bear and, like a bear coming out hibernation, he was slow to wake up.\nKranz enjoyed the early-morning silence and the searchlights in the distance assured him that the countdown was still running.\nEverything was on schedule when he arrived.\nKranz checked out communications on his and Kraft\u2019s console.\nKraft greeted him with his usual, \u201cHow\u2019s it going, young man?\u201d and Kranz responded with a thumbs-up.\nThen, Kraft was distracted by some issues with the worldwide data network and Kranz moved on.\nKranz described the moment when he heard Shepard had entered his spacecraft as \u201csurreal.\u201d This was the moment they had all waited for since signing up.\nThen, things started to go south.\nThey sat through five delays and the weather started to foul up.\nSome of them had to wonder if they were going to face another scrubbed

don\u2019t you fix your little problem and light this candle?\u201d And then the most astonishing routine came over the communications loop.", "There were a few unresolved items and glitches, informally referred to as \u201cfunnies\u201d, in Kraft\u2019s logbook.\nThey were minor items and easily resolved, and then Kranz turned his attention to preparing Gemini 4 for drifting flight so the crew could get some sleep.\nDirect contact with the spacecraft would be sporadic as its orbit took it into areas not covered by the tracking network.\nKranz\u2019s team spent most of this quiet time to do a more in-depth analysis of the spacecraft\u2019s systems and orbital trajectory.", "Off", "Gemini 6", "Making the job even more difficult, Ed White knew about the possible EVA before most of Mission Control did.\nKranz would have preferred the chance to brief remote site teams before the flight but was told, \u201cNo briefings.\u201d The remote site CapComs were given sealed envelopes that would only be opened if given specific instructions from Kranz.\nThey contained only a brief note addressing the EVA, plus a planned rendezvous with the booster after separation.\nKranz prepared for his Gemini 4 flight director duties during the day and worked on the EVA at night.\nThe EVA ground team reviewed footage of Leonov\u2019s spacewalk and inspected hardware being developed for White\u2019s EVA with the goal of having everything ready two weeks before the scheduled launch date.\nIn the meantime, Marta had given birth to their fifth child.\nTheir house in Flight Controller

issues like releasing technical details of the spacecraft and assigning representatives to the control center to help with preparations.\nThey even got into the ongoing debate about the route they would take to the moon.\nOne favorite route was called Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR), in which astronauts would rendezvous with a spacecraft already in orbit and land that spacecraft on the moon.\nAnother route was an underdog called Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR), in which a crew of three astronauts would go into lunar orbit, and then two of them would undock in a smaller spacecraft and land it on the moon.\nNAA took the EOR side, which would give them full control of manufacturing the spacecraft.", "Kranz was promoted to assistant flight director, second only to Chris Kraft in the

cucumber and realized that it would have been the wrong move.\nHe would comment later that having been through a launch once before helped.\nHe knew what liftoff felt like and knew by the lack of rising G-forces that they were still on the launchpad.\nHe and Stafford kept rattling off numbers.", "Mission Control\u2019s transfer to Houston was getting into high gear and Kranz sent out one of Control\u2019s new recruits, Manfred \u201cDutch\u201d Von Ehrenfried, as a real estate scout.\nKranz\u2019s only conditions were that the housing be affordable and that the down payment not be more than $250.\nThe part of Houston that Von Ehrenfried found for them came to be known as Flight Controller Alley.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) was also growing in size, from 750 to 1800 employees in three months.\nMany of these new people were brand-new graduates from colleges around Texas.\nA basic training course for flight controllers was set up.\nThe first class of six spent two weeksworth of twelve-hour days learning learning Morse code and speed printing.\nKranz handed out their flight controllerscertificates himself, and then the first class went out to the remote sites.\nA few of the controllers posted in unfriendly territories like Zanzibar had military experience that served them well when they ran across such obstacles as burning roadblocks and hostile natives.\nSome of the new mission controllers served only one or two missions, decided the responsibility was too much for them, and moved on to other careers.\nOthers didn\u2019t want to relocate from Virginia.\nThose who stayed had a chance to move up the ladder and be reassigned back to the friendlier Houston.", "Ready For EVA?", "Even though everybody in NASA had the same goal of going to the Moon, there were frequent disagreements about how to get there and who was in charge of what.\nMission Control got into a tug-of-war with the astronaut office over who, exactly, was in charge of the remote stations.\nSince Alan Shepard\u2019s flight, it had become traditional to assign astronauts in the role of Capsule Communicator, the one who would have direct contact with the spacecraft in flight, both in Houston and at the remote sites.\nThough Deke Slayton had been forced into a purely administrative role after being grounded, he was still an astronaut at heart and believed that only astronauts could handle the time-sensitive decision making and communications involved in the role.\nHis belief was shared by Alan Shepard, who was similarly grounded with a debilitating ear condition and worked closely with Slayton.\nMost of the astronauts who were actually sent out to those sites felt the same.", "The Angry Alligator", "Deke Slayton was slated for the very next orbital mission with Wally Schirra as his backup.\nThings were going reasonably well until Slayton was making a centrifuge run and the physician detected a minor heart fibrillation.\nHe stopped the run and reported it.\nEven then, Slayton didn\u2019t expect problems.\nHe had made test flights in the F-105 without any trouble and didn\u2019t expect this to be any more serious.\nIt didn\u2019t turn out that way and Slayton was yanked from the flight.\nNormally, Wally Schirra would have stepped up to the plate as his backup, but they gave the flight to Scott Carpenter instead.\nAt first, Kranz thought Slayton had been pulled off the flight because he complained too much about the experiments he was supposed to perform on the flight.\nWhen he found out the truth, he chalked it up to the fact that if you asked enough experts, you would eventually find one nay-sayer.\nSlayton took charge of the astronaut corps, an important job that must have felt like a consolation prize.", "By the end of the Mercury Project, there were only 50 controllers left in Florida.\nHouston proved to be a friendly host city, even naming their baseball team the \u201cAstros\u201d in honor of the astronauts.", "The Apollo spacecraft went through a redesign process that included a hatch that could be opened in seconds, a reduction in combustible materials in the spacecraft, a change in the cabin\u2019s atmosphere from pure oxygen to a hydrogen-oxygen mix, and insulated wires that couldn\u2019t cause sparks.", "White\u2019s easy EVA during Gemini 4 had fooled them all.\nEVA was harder than it looked and it was added to their list of problems to solve before the first moon landing.\nThe problem was in the way the astronauts were being trained and the rocketmeisters in Huntsville, Alabama, solved it with a water tank where astronauts could practice EVA activity.\nGemini 9 came home safely and Gene Kranz moved over to Apollo.\nHe missed being a flight director for Gemini 10, 11 and 12 but had plenty of work to do.\nHe found a program full with problems.\nApollo 1", "Mission Control believed otherwise.\nKranz, in particular, felt that the astronautsproper role at the remote sites was as observers and assistants.\nFive days before the launch of the first manned Gemini, Astronauts Pete Conrad and Neil Armstrong went out to the remote sites at Carnarvon and Hawaii, respectively.\nOnce Pete Conrad got to Carnarvon, he encountered Dan Hunter, who was in charge of the station.\nBoth were equally strong-willed and it would lead to a showdown that would provide greater clarity of the roles of both Mission Control and the Astronaut Office during the flight.\nThe trouble started while Kranz and Kraft were still in Florida after Gemini 2.\nDeke Slayton was in town, too, and received word that Conrad and Hunter had gotten into a heated argument over who was in charge.\nHunter had threatened to kick Conrad out of the station for butting into his turf and the hapless station crew sent a message asking for clarification about whose orders they should follow.\nHe went straight to the apartment where Kranz and Kraft were staying.\nThey had fallen asleep, but the banging on the door woke them right up.\nSlayton shouted, \u201cChris, we got a problem!\u201d Kranz threw on some clothes and, by the time he got out there, Kraft and Slayton were about ready to duke it out.\n\u201cDammit, Chris, get your guy under control!\u201d snarled Slayton.\nSomehow, they kept it to mere words and talked it out until three in the morning.", "America was now in the manned space business and, in the wake of this victory, Kennedy set a new goal for NASA in a speech to Congress.\n\u201cI believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.\u201d Many people in NASA thought the President was too ambitious.\nGene Kranz could only think: \u201cWell, let them get on with their great plans.\nI\u2019m gonna put a man in orbit first.\u201d The second suborbital, Liberty Bell 7 manned by Gus Grissom, was nearly a carbon copy of Freedom 7, though the capsule sank and Grissom nearly drowned.\nThe helicopter crews seemed more worried about retrieving the capsule than rescuing Grissom.\nKranz growled to his console, \u201cForget the capsule, just get Gus.\u201d Grissom barely made it out of there by grabbing a line from one of the helicopters.\nThen, the Russians forced NASA\u2019s hand with another space spectacular.\nThe next manned flight would be an orbital one.", "Kranz\u2019s first shift in Mission Control passed uneventfully and he handed the logbook to John Hodge.\nHe hung his white vest on a hook, his thoughts racing ahead to the news conference he now had to face.\nThough NASA\u2019s public-relations officers were not universally popular and often hated by the astronauts, Gene Kranz thought they really earned their pay when dealing with the press conferences.\nThis press conference did cause one lingering misconception about Kranz.\nThe blurbs about the flight directors in the press release said he looked like a poster boy for the Marines.\nThe press ate that one up and, from then on, Kranz felt like he was forever explaining that he was Air Force, not Marines.\nHe found a place at MCC to sleep until the end of the mission.\nIf he needed an assist to wind down, he could go to the doctors for a double shot of whiskey to put in his coffee.\nHe found out fast that whiskey and coffee were not a good combination.\nOther controllers didn\u2019t like the idea of relying on drugs to get to sleep and did without.\nGemini 4 splashed down on June 27 after a successful mission.\nMarta was happy that her white vest had gone over so well and Kranz had an idea that she could make a more flashy vest he could wear at the end of a mission to signal his team that they had done a good job.", "Kraft probably remembered the time SimSup had told him that Kranz had gotten into an accident on the way to the Center.\n\u201cIs this your doing, SimSup?\u201d"]
