church, or from a place of refuge for Danes after the conquest of Alfred the Great.\nIt was transferred to the Order of the Knights Templar by Henry II in 1189.\nIt survived the Great Fire in 1666, but was declared unsafe and rebuilt by Christopher Wren in 1679.\nThe building was damaged during the Blitz in 1941, gutting much of the interior, and was rebuilt in 1958 by Sam Lloyd, since when it has served as the central church of the Royal Air Force.\nThe church is one of two possible origins for the \"St Clement's\" in the nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\", though more contemporary accounts suggest St Clement's, Eastcheap in the City of London to be more likely.\nSt Mary le Strand was designed by James Gibbs and completed in 1717, to replace a previous church demolished to make way for Somerset House.\nIt was the first building to be designed by Gibbs, who was influenced by Wren and Michelangelo.\nThe column on top of the church was originally designed to support a statue of Queen Anne, but was replaced with a spire following Anne's death in 1714.\nIt survived the Blitz but was in poor shape until John Betjeman led a campaign to restore it in the 1970s.\nEssex Street Chapel, the birthplace of British Unitarianism, abuts onto the Strand.\nThe original chapel was built in 1774, but damaged in the Blitz.\nIt was restored after the war, and now serves as the denominational headquarters.", "The length of road from St Mary's eastwards up to St Clement's was widened in 1900, subsuming the former Holywell Street which forked from the Strand and ran parallel with it to the north, leaving the two churches of St Mary Le Strand and St.Clement Danes as islands in the centre of the road.\nGaiety Theatre was demolished, to be replaced by Citibank House, while Villiers House and New South Wales House were both built in 1957 \u2013 59.\nNew South Wales House was subsequently demolished in 1996 and replaced by an office block.\nIn 1998, a statue of Oscar Wilde was built at the junction of Adelaide Street and Duncannon Street, adjoining the western end of the Strand.", "It was then demolished and new streets and buildings built on the site, including George Street, Villiers Street, Duke Street, Of Alley, and Buckingham Street.\nCecil House, also called Exeter House or Burghley House, built in the 16th century by Lord Burghley as an expansion of an existing Tudor house.\nExeter House was demolished in 1676 and Exeter Exchange built on the site.", "The west part of the Strand was in the parish of St Martin in the Fields and in the east it extended into the parishes of St Clement Danes and St Mary le Strand.\nMost of its length was in the Liberty of Westminster, although part of the eastern section in St Clement Danes was in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex.\nThe precinct of the Savoy, located approximately where the approach to Waterloo Bridge is now, had the Strand as its northern boundary.\nAll of these parishes and places became part of the Strand District in 1855, except St Martin in the Fields which was governed separately.\nThe Strand District Board of Works was based at No.\n22, Tavistock Street.", "The Rose

1816 \u2013 20 to build the approach road to Waterloo Bridge, eventually being demolished in the 19th century.\nThe Savoy Hotel now occupies this site.", "These included Essex House, Arundel House, Somerset House, Savoy Palace, Durham House and Cecil House.\nThe aristocracy moved to the West End over the 17th century, following which the Strand became well known for coffee shops, restaurants and taverns.\nThe street was a centre point for theatre and music hall during the 19th century, and several venues remain on the Strand.\nAt the east end of the street are two historic churches; St Mary le Strand and St Clement Danes.\nSeveral authors, poets and philosophers have lived on or near the Strand, including Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Virginia Woolf.", "A menagerie was built on the upper floors in 1773, which was later run by Edward Cross, who housed lions, tigers, monkeys and hippopotami.\nIn 1826, an elephant, Chunee, nearly broke free from its cage and had to be destroyed; the skeleton was later put on display.\nThe exchange was demolished in 1829, with the menagerie moving to the Surrey Zoological Gardens, and replaced by Exeter Hall, noted for its Evangelical meetings.\nThis was demolished in 1907, and the site is now occupied by the Strand Palace Hotel.", "After Elizabeth's death in 1603, it was owned by Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI and I.\nThe building was renamed Denmark House in commemoration of Anne's brother, Christian IV of Denmark.\nFollowing James' death in 1625, his body lay there intestate for a month.\nIt was taken over by Parliament in 1645 following the Civil War, renaming it back to Somerset House.", "It clarified exactly what crimes constituted treason, following earlier, somewhat \" over zealous \" interpretations of England's legal codes.\nFor instance, high treason could be committed by anyone found to be compassing the king's death or counterfeiting his coin.", "The Times incorrectly stated that Sullivan was burned alive, rhetoric which, in Dr Simon Devereaux's opinion, could be \"rooted in the growing reverence for domesticated womanhood\" that might have been expected at the time.\nAs many objections may also have been raised by the perceived iniquity of drawing and burning women for coining, whereas until 1783, when the halting of executions at Tyburn removed ritualistic dragging from public view, men were simply drawn and hanged.\nA widening gulf between the numbers of men and women whipped in London (during the 1790s, 393 men versus 47 women), which mirrors a similar decline in the sending of women to the pillory, may also indicate an imposition of commonly-held gender ideals on English penal practices.", "The official residence of the Secretary of State, next door at No.\n1 the Strand, became the first numbered address in London.", "The episode received mixed reviews from television critics.", "About 30 minutes later, faggots were placed around the stake, her body was chained into position, and subsequently burned for over two hours.\nExecutions like this had once passed with little to no comment in the press.\nHistorically, while fewer women than men were subjected to capital punishment, proportionately more were acquitted, found guilty of lesser charges, or pardoned if condemned.\nIn centuries past, these women were judged by publications such as The Newgate Calendar to have succumbed to their own perversions, or to have been led astray.", "Lee was apparently brought on foot, between two sheriff's officers and dressed in a red waistcoat, to the place of execution in Smithfield.\nThere she confessed to having \"been a very lewd liver, and much given to cursing and swearing, for which the Lord being offended with her, had suffered her to be brought to that untimely end\".\nShe admitted to being jealous of and arguing with her husband, and stabbing him with a knife.\nThe executioner put her in a pitch barrel, tied her to the stake, placed the fuel and faggots around her and set them alight.\nLee was reported to have \"desired all that were present to pray for her\" and, feeling the flames, \"shrike[d] out terribly some five or six

20,000 people, she was led to the stake and stood on a stool, where a noose, attached to an iron bolt driven into the top of the stake, was placed around her neck.\nAs prayers were read, the stool was taken away and over the course of several minutes, her feet kicking as her body convulsed, Harris choked to death.", "After Seymour was executed in 1549, the property was sold to Henry FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel, and was owned by the Earldom for much of the 16th and 17th century.\nIn 1666, it became the meeting place of the Royal Society following the destruction of the previous venue due to the Great Fire of London.\nThe house was demolished in 1678 and Arundel Street, adjoining the Strand, was built on the site.", "Apart from the rebuilt Somerset House, all of these buildings have been

station which today forms part of Charing Cross station.", "Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave a mostly positive review, giving it a 7.5 out of 10, indicating that it was a \"good\" episode.\nHe stated, \"Things are still a bit wobbly on Veronica Mars this season, though this episode had some elements that hopefully herald a turn in the right direction.\"\nWhile criticizing the case-of-the-week, he was more laudatory to the subplots, calling Sheriff Lamb arresting Weevil \"the most entertaining scene of the episode\" and that \"the episode definitely picked up in the last
