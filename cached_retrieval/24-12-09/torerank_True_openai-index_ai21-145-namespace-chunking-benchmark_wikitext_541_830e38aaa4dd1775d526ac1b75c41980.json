Mudry, a year behind Tatsuguchi at Loma Linda University, later said, \"I know him well.\nI always thought Tatsuguchi \u2014 we called him Paul \u2014 was quite an American.\"\nOn September 8, 1938, Tatsuguchi graduated as a Doctor of Medicine and was awarded a California medical license.\nThat same year, he accepted a position at the Tokyo Adventist Sanitarium, an institution founded in part by his father in 1928.", "After Tatsuguchi's death his Japanese diary, as well as his Bible, a copy of Gray's Anatomy and an address book, were forwarded to the division intelligence section.\nThere, an American Nisei serviceman named Yasuo Sam Umetani drafted the first translation of the diary.\nWord of the diary's contents spread quickly through divisional headquarters to the other American troops on Attu.\nAmericans were intrigued by the news that an American-trained doctor had been with the Japanese forces on the island and that Tatsuguchi had described the battle from a Japanese perspective.\nUnauthorized copies of both Umetani's version and subsequent translations, some of which contained variations, were passed around among the American troops on Attu and to military installations on other Aleutian islands.", "Japanese forces had first occupied Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands on June 7, 1942 during the Battle of Midway.\nThey abandoned Attu in September 1942, but then decided to reoccupy it.\nA regiment of IJA soldiers from the Northern Sea Detachment ( \u5317\u6c34\u652f\u96c6\u5217 Hokkai Shitai ), a detachment of Imperial Japanese Navy Special Naval Landing Force troops, and support personnel began arriving on Attu in October 1942.\nThe total number of Japanese on the island would eventually be between 2,500 and 2,900 men.\nExactly when Tatsuguchi arrived on Attu is unclear, because he was forbidden from specifying dates in the letters he wrote to Taeko, but it was probably between November 1942 and January 1943.\nHe was assigned to the Northern 5216 Detachment North Sea Defense Hospital.", "With an American naval blockade in place, mail between Attu and Japan was infrequent and unscheduled.\nTatsuguchi received several small packages from Taeko containing cookies and ointment for his skin, which was chafed by Attu's severe winter winds.\nFour letters and several postcards from Tatsuguchi reached Taeko.\nAs he was forbidden from discussing his unit's exact location or mission, Tatsuguchi wrote about the weather, the beauty of the snowy and mountainous landscape around him, and his success in catching fish.\nHe was cheered by the news from Taeko that their second daughter, Laura Mutsuko, was born in February.", "In September 1942, after learning that he would be reassigned to a combat area in Rabaul, New Britain, he noted in his diary, \"I feel very happy and I am determined to do my best\", adding that he was \"determined to destroy the enemy force to the very last soldier\".\nTatsuguchi reached Rabaul on October 4, 1942.\nHis stay there was probably short, for his wife recorded that he joined her in Tokyo that same month prior to being redeployed.\nTatsuguchi was unable to tell his wife, now pregnant with their second child, where he would be assigned, but she noticed that he studied maps of the North Pacific area.\nAt one point, he remarked to Taeko that he was going to an area where he might meet some of his former classmates from California.", "Several American newspapers published excerpts from the diary, and most highlighted the possibility that Tatsuguchi, a professed Christian, might have been involved in the killing of wounded patients.\nThe Chicago Tribune on September 9, 1943 published an article headlined \"Japs Slew Own Patients on Attu, Diary Discloses\".\nIn contrast, the Loma Linda School of Medicine Alumni Journal defended Tatsuguchi as a gentle and caring doctor who was trapped in a situation beyond his control, where his actions violated neither his religious beliefs nor his oaths as a doctor.\nMost Western historical accounts of the Battle of Attu mention Tatsuguchi and quote from his diary, especially the final entry.", "Also in 1938, Tatsuguchi married a childhood friend, Taeko Miyake.\nTaeko's parents were serving as Adventist missionaries in Honolulu, Hawaii, while Taeko pursued studies in California.\nPaul and Taeko departed the U.S. for Japan in 1939.", "J. Mudry and another of Tatsuguchi's Loma Linda classmates, J. L. Whitaker, were medical officers with the US Seventh Division on Attu during the battle.\nWhitaker was in the path of Yamasaki's final attack, but survived without injury.\nWhitaker and Mudry were stunned to later learn that their former classmate was on the island with Japanese forces and was killed nearby.", "Tatsuguchi's father, Suichi Tatsuguchi, was born and raised in Hiroshima, Japan before leaving for the US in 1895 to \"explore the new world\".\nHe attended Healdsburg College, later renamed Pacific Union College, in Angwin, California.\nWhile attending the college, he was baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\nIn 1907, after completing a course of study in dentistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in San Francisco, Suichi Tatsuguchi returned to Hiroshima with plans to serve as a medical missionary.\nIn Hiroshima, Tatsuguchi established a prosperous dental practice and promoted the establishment of the Hiroshima Adventist church.\nHe married Sadako Shibata who was also familiar with the US and spoke fluent English.\nSuichi and Sadako had three sons and three daughters.\nAll three sons would eventually attend school in the US.", "The United States Army landed on the island on May 11 1943 intending to retake the island from the Japanese.\nThroughout the ensuing battle, Tatsuguchi kept a diary in which he recorded its events and his struggle to care for the wounded in his field hospital.\nHe was killed on the battle's final day after the remaining Japanese conducted one last, suicidal charge against the American forces.\nTatsuguchi's diary was recovered by American forces and translated into English.\nCopies of the translation were widely disseminated and publicized in the US after the battle.\nThe American public was intrigued by a Christian, American-trained doctor serving with Japanese forces on the island and by his apparent participation in assisting with the deaths of wounded Japanese soldiers in his field hospital during the battle's final days.\nTranslated excerpts from Tatsuguchi's diary have been widely quoted in Western historical accounts of the battle, especially his final entry in which he recorded a farewell message to his family.", "Tatsuguchi reminded Taeko in his letters to play classical music for their daughters.\nWhether he kept his diary during this time is unclear, for the only known diary entries by Tatsuguchi began in May, after the American landings to retake the island.", "Hirn later stated that he could not hear what Tatsuguchi was saying over the wind and noise of battle and that he thought that the Bible Tatsuguchi was holding was a weapon.\nThe other version was told to Taeko and Laura by Charles Laird in 1984.\nLaird, a former US Army sergeant who served on Attu, stated that he was sleeping in a tent the morning of May 30 when Yamasaki's troops broke through the American front lines.\nA man ran into Laird's tent and Laird shot and killed him, only to discover that the man was American.\nThen he saw eight Japanese soldiers approaching through the fog, so he shot and killed them too.\nOne of them was Tatsuguchi.\nLaird said that he found Tatsuguchi's diary and an address book in which he was shocked to see American names and addresses.", "Tatsuguchi recorded in his diary that he was forced to move his field hospital into a cave to escape American naval and aerial bombardment.\nHe relocated the hospital and patients several times as the Japanese forces were pushed back by the Americans.\nHis May 17 entry describes one of the moves: At night about 11:30 o'clock under cover of darkness I left the cave.\nWalked over muddy roads and steep hills of no-man's land.\nNo matter how far or how much we went we did not get over the pass.\nSat down after 30\u201340 steps would sleep dream and wake up, same thing over again.", "A few weeks after Tatsuguchi left for his new assignment, the IJA delivered a lock of his hair to Taeko.\nThe IJA did this whenever soldiers were sent to a high-risk combat area in case the soldier was killed and it proved impossible to repatriate the remains for proper funeral rites.", "Tatsuguchi's last diary entry records Yamasaki's order, the disposition of the wounded in his hospital, and a farewell message to his family: Today at 2 o'clock we assembled at Headquarters, the field hospital took also part.\nThe last assault is to be carried out.\nAll the patients in the hospital were made to commit suicide.\nI am only 33 years old and I am to die.\nHave no regrets.\nBanzai to the Emperor.\nI am grateful that I have kept the peace in my soul which Enkis [believed to mean either Christ or the Edict] bestowed on me at 8 o'clock.", "The Japanese government notified Taeko of her husband's death in August 1943.\nTaeko and her two daughters survived the remainder of the war on a small widow's pension and with help from relatives.\nTaeko hoped that her husband was still alive and would return.\nJust after the war ended, B. P.
