lthough the mainline of the road continued eastbound as Quonset Road ( now Roger Williams Way ) , Route 403 officially terminated at the intersection with the US 1 access ramps . 

 Since the completion of the Quonset Freeway in 2008 and the full relocation of Route 403 , the old route on Davisville Road and Devil 's Foot Road has been unnumbered . Some portions of the road are signed " To RI 403 , " but there is no indication that RIDOT plans to designate the old route as Rhode Island Route 403A . Route 403 's previous alignment was largely unchanged during the construction of the Quonset Freeway ; only the interchanges with Routes 4 and 402 in East Greenwich and with US 1 in North Kingstown were altered significantly . 


 = = = Quonset Freeway = = = 


 The Quonset Freeway begins in East Greenwich at Exit 7 of Route 4 ; southbound , the exit is numbered 7B , as Exit 7A serves Route 402 . Unlike Route 402 , which is accessible only via Route 4 southbound , Route 403 is accessible from the northbound lanes of Route 4 via the newly constructed Exit 7 . Like the original Route 403 , the nominally east – west freeway follows a northeastern – southwestern route for much of its length . Shortly after beginning at Route 4 , Route 403 crosses over Route 402 and the Hunt River on a single @-@ span bridge , entering the town of North Kingstown . The relocation of Route 403 removed access to Route 402 ; the freeway now travels over Frenchtown Road without an interchange . While there is no direct link between the two routes , motorists traveling westbound on Route 403 can take the exit for Route 4 south and then access Route 402 from Exit 7A off Route 4 . 

 Route 403 continues in a southeastern direction before crossing over Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor rail line . The freeway begins to closely parallel the railroad before crossing under Devil 's Foot Road , the original Route 403 , and entering the village of Davisville . Shortly after the overpass , Route 403 turns to head almost due east . The freeway has its first interchange with West Davisville Road ; the exit is accessible only from eastbound Route 403 , and serves the villages of Davisville and Quidnessett . Closely paralleling Devil 's Foot Road , Route 403 continues eastward before interchanging with U.S. Route 1 ( Post Road ) and Davisville Road ; the two roads are served via a single exit . Westbound Route 403 has no direct interchange with either US 1 or Davisville Road ; the route 's first westbound exit in Quonset is signed as " To US 1 , " and connects to Post Road via Gate Road , a commercial outlet in Quonset . 

 Shortly after the interchange with US 1 , Route 403 begins to head in a southwestern direction . After 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) miles , Route 403 terminates at a traffic signal with Commerce Park Road , a commercial route that heads north into the business park . The mainline of Route 403 continues eastward as Roger Williams Way ( formerly Quonset Road ) , a four @-@ lane , undivided road that leads to Quonset State Airport . 


 = = History = = 


 The original Route 403 that existed prior to 2006 was numbered in 1973 as a spur route of the newly constructed Route 4 . The two @-@ lane , undivided state highway was the main access road to Davisville and Quonset Point from Route 4 . Quonset was home to Naval Air Station Quonset Point , a major U.S. naval base , until 1974 . After the closure of the base , the Quonset Point region of North Kingstown was converted into an industrial zone and commercial district by the state of Rhode Island ; a container port and the Quonset State Airport were also opened for commercial use . 

 By the 1980s , more than 12 @,@ 000 cars were using Route 403 daily to access the business park ; the Rhode Island Department of Transportation ( RIDOT ) estimated that this vehicle volume would exceed 25 @,@ 000 by 2005 . This high vehicle capacity would be dangerous because of Route 403 's sharp curves and low speed limit in Davisville . The narrow route through a densely populated region was particularly unsuitable for the high volume of commercial trucks that used it to access Route 4 from the Quonset Business Park and container port . RIDOT began studies on improving the route in 1987 , exploring both the widening of the existing route to a four @-@ lane , undivided highway and the construction of a freeway as options . The proposal to widen the existing road was ultimately dropped , as it would less effective at relieving congestion in the region and would require significant demolition of existing structures in Davisville . A freeway alternative to be constructed north of the existing route with more direct access to Route 4 and an eastward expansion beyond US 1 into the Quonset Business Park was selected instead . 


 = = = Construction of the Quonset Freeway = = = 


 Construction of " Phase 1 " of the four @-@ lane , limited @-@ access Quonset Freeway began in 2000 with excavation of the route and right @-@ of @-@ way acquisition ; the project required the demolition of 13 structures , five commercial and eight residential . Phase 1 included an extension of the highway into the Quonset Business Park and the construction of several overpasses in Quonset , an exit ramp to Gate Road , a full interchange with U.S. Route 1 in North Kingstown , and a partial diamond interchange with West Davisville Road in Davisville . During Phase 1 's construction , traffic was maintained on the existing Route 403 ( Devil 's Foot Road ) ; the only major alteration to the route was the setting of a new eastern terminus of the road at US 1 , as the previous terminus was demolished to allow for the construction of the freeway . Phase 1 cost $ 70 million to complete and was opened to traffic on June 22 , 2006 . The new freeway was posted with a speed limit of 45 miles per hour ( 72 km / h ) . 

 From 2006 until 2008 , while Phase 2 of the relocated Route 403 was constructed , traffic on the newly completed freeway from Quonset to Davisville was rediected onto Davisville Road ( the original route alignment ) , which continued on to the existing terminus at Routes 4 and 402 . Traffic was diverted onto the original route alignment after the West Davisville Road interchange , passing over the Amtrak rail tracks via the existing Devil 's Foot Road overpass bridge . 

 Construction of the $ 100 million @-@ Phase 2 of the Quonset Freeway began in 2004 and continued until 2008 . The project included the construction of new bridges over the Northeast Corridor rail line , Route 402 , and Route 4 . The existing Route 403 bridge over Route 4 was also demolished as a part of Phase 2 . The freeway and ramps from Route 403 west to Route 4 north and from Route 4 south to Route 403 east opened on October 23 , 2008 . The route was posted with a speed limit of 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) . The final portion of Phase 2 , ramps from Route 403 west to Route 4 south and from Route 4 north to Route 403 east , opened in December 2008 . As part of the construction of a trumpet interchange with Route 4 in East Greenwich , a new northbound Exit 7 on Route 4 was completed ; the original Route 403 was accessible only from Route 4 southbound . All major construction on the freeway was completed in December 2008 , one year ahead of schedule ; minor projects continued on the relocated route until early 2009 .

 = Sega Meganet = 


 Sega Meganet , also known as the Net Work System , was an online service for the Mega Drive in Japan and later Brazil . Utilizing dial @-@ up Internet access , Meganet was Sega 's first online multiplayer gaming service , and functioned on a pay to play basis . The system functioned through the use of a peripheral called the Mega Modem and offered several unique titles that could be downloaded , and a few could be played competitively with friends . In addition , it shared technology and equipment with more serious services such as the Mega Anser , used for banking purposes . Though the system was announced for North America under the rebranded name " Tele @-@ Genesis " , it was never released for that region . Ultimately , the Meganet service would be short @-@ lived , lasting approximately a year before it was discontinued , but would serve as a precursor to the Sega Channel and XBAND services , as well as a predecessor to online gaming services for video game consoles . Retrospective feedback praises the attempt by Sega to introduce online gaming , but criticizes the service for its logistical issues and lack of titles . 


 = = History = = 


 Sega 's 16 @-@ bit console , the Sega Genesis ( known as Mega Drive in most areas outside of North America ) was released in Japan on October 29 , 1988 , though the launch was overshadowed by Nintendo 's release of Super Mario Bros. 3 a week earlier . Positive coverage from magazines Famitsu and Beep ! helped to establish a following , but Sega only managed to ship 400 @,@ 000 units in the first year . In order to draw a larger audience , Sega began work on an Internet service , similar to what Nintendo had attempted with the Famicom Tsushin for the NES . 

 Released in Japan on November 3 , 1990 , at a cost of JP ¥ 12 @,@ 800 ( approximately US $ 100 ) for the equipment , as well as an additional ¥ 800 monthly , access began to the Meganet service by way of the Mega Modem , a peripheral which attaches to the rear EXT 9 @-@ pin port on the rear of the console . From the modem , a cable runs to a dual @-@ port connector , which connects into a telephone line . The Mega Modem also came packaged with a cartridge which allowed for access to the Meganet game library , and approximately six titles were available at launch . It was capable of connection speeds of up to 1200bit / s . Though the service had also been advertised in North America under the name " Tele @-@ Genesis " in publications such as Electronic Gaming Monthly , it was never released for the region . 

 As another way of attempting to expand the audience for the Mega Drive in Japan , Sega introduced the Mega Anser , a system designed for use with Nagoya Bank in Japan , in 1990 . Packaged as an all @-@ in @-@ one system including a Mega Drive , Mega Modem , Mega Anser cartridge and keypad , the system allowed for transactions such as balance inquiries , transfers , and loan information . It initially retailed at a cost of JP ¥ 34 @,@ 000 including the home console , and a version with an additional printer retailed for ¥ 72 @,@ 800 . 

 Due to the system 's low number of titles , prohibitively high price , and the Mega Drive 's lack of success in Japan , the Meganet system proved to be a commercial failure . By 1992 , the Mega Modem peripheral could be found in bargain bins at a reduced price , and a remodeled version of the Mega Drive released in 1993 removed the EXT 9 @-@ pin port altogether , preventing the newer model from being connected to the Meganet service . 

 In 1995 , the Meganet internet service launched in Brazil . Its main focus in the region was e @-@ mail , although by 1996 the service was capable of online multiplayer , along with chat features . Similar to the Mega Anser , a home banking product was also released for the region . Meganet hardware and services were provided through Sega 's distributor in the region , Tectoy . 


 = = Game library = = 


 The Meganet service utilized its own library of titles , independent of the Genesis library . Most of these games never received a cartridge release ; however , Columns , Flicky , Fatal Labyrinth , and Teddy Boy Blues each later saw cartridge versions . Several Meganet games would also later appear in Game no Kanzume vol . 2 , released for the Mega @-@ CD exclusively in Japan . Most games for the service were small , at around 128kB per game , due to the limits of Internet connection speeds at the time . Downloads were estimated to take about five to eight minutes to complete . 

 All of the Meganet games were available through the Sega Game Library , accessed through the Meganet modem . Due to issues with long @-@ distance charges through the use of telephone lines , as well as seconds of lag time between commands , only two games featured competitive play : Tel @-@ Tel Stadium and Tel @-@ Tel Mahjong , with the remainder of the games available for single players via download . Due to Sega 's reluctance to commit to releasing the service in North America , third @-@ party developers in that region were unwilling to invest in developing games specifically for Meganet . This resulted in a low number of titles created for the service . 


 = = Reception and legacy = = 


 Retrospective feedback on the Sega Meganet service is mixed , praising the early initiative to develop online gaming for video consoles , but criticizing its implementation via use of telephone lines and issues with Sega 's lack of developers for the service . Adam Redsell of IGN commented on the basic features of the service , and despite noting that Meganet received only a few games , stated " [ T ] hat 's pretty damn impressive for 1990 " . He also notes the influence of Sega in the development of online gaming , with the Meganet service as their first attempt , and credits the Meganet 's successor , Sega Channel , with helping to spread broadband Internet . 

 However , the telephone line network which the Meganet ran on has been criticized for its logistical issues in online gaming . According to Electronic Gaming Monthly , " Even though the TeleGenesis modem has been announced , it has yet to appear and the real usefulness of a device that is used only to play games with friends over the phone lines remains questionable ( both have to have the modem , the phone lines must be clear , the phone bills will be a problem if it ’ s a long @-@ distance call , etc . ) " The same issues that plagued the Meganet over the use of phone lines for Internet connectivity would later resurface when Catapult Entertainment launched the XBAND service in 1994 . 

 Ken Horowitz of Sega @-@ 16 took note of Sega 's reluctance to commit to releasing the service in North America as part of the reason for its lack of titles , noting , " Companies were most likely waiting for confirmation of the modem ’ s release before they began to commit themselves , and as time has attested , few were waiting to go ahead with development in light of Sega 's ' wait and see ' attitude . " Horowitz went on to criticize this issue as a problem Sega would have again with the Sega 32X in 1994 , stating , " History would repeat itself in the harshest of manners only five years later . Sega 's expectations of third party support for something it showed little enthusiasm for were entirely unrealistic and ultimately meant that no games would be in the pipeline . " 



 = Innherredsferja = 


 Innherredsferja AS ( " The Innherred Ferry " ) was a Norwegian ferry operator in the Trondheimsfjord in Nord @-@ Trøndelag county . It operated the Levanger – Hokstad Ferry between the town of Levanger and the island of Ytterøya , and the Vangshylla – Kjerringvik Ferry between Inderøy and Mosvik . The company operated seven ferries through its history , and had up to three operating at any time , including one in reserve . Innherredsferja was based in Levanger . 

 The company was founded in 1957 , and started a service between Venneshamn , Kjerringvik , Vangshylla , Hokstad , and Levanger . The initial owners of the company were a mixture of municipalities , the county , and private individuals and companies . In 1964 , the company 's operations were split into two services , each with a single crossing . Following the opening of the Skarnsund Bridge in 1991 , the Vangshylla – Kjerringvik Ferry was terminated . In 2005 , the company was taken over by Fosen Trafikklag , after the state decided that the route would be subject to public service obligation . The company lost the bid to Nor @-@ Ferjer , and operation ceased at the end of 2006 .

 = = = Establishment = = = 


 The initiative for a cross @-@ fjord ferry services was taken by Arthur Selvig , leader of the merchants ' association in Levanger . In January 1955 , he invited members of the municipal councils on both sides of the fjord to establish a company . The meeting was held in Levanger , and the representatives from Mosvik took two days to get to the meeting . An interim committee was appointed , which was to cooperate with Innherreds Aktie Dampskibsselskab to persuade them not purchase a new ship , and also to consider purchase of a combined car- and cargo @-@ ferry , or alternatively a conventional vessel . At the time , National Road 755 between Mosvik and Leksvik was being constructed and would be competed by the end of the decade ; however , it would take longer before Mosvik would be connected to Venneshamn . The committee suggested the route Venneshamn – Kjerringvik – Vangshylla – Ytterøy – Levanger be established . The municipal council of Ytterøy voted to place the ferry quay at Hokstad , which was serving as the municipal center . 

 State funding of NOK 105 @,@ 000 was granted to build ferry quays at Hokstad , Levanger and Venneshamn . The committee decided that they wanted a ferry similar to one delivered by Moen & Sønns Båtbyggeri which was at the time stationed in Trondheim , costing NOK 450 @,@ 000 . To finance this , state guarantees for the load and deficits needed to be granted . The Ministry of Transport and Communications promised to grant partial guarantees if local guarantees were also issued . Sale of shares started in 1957 , and the municipalities of Inderøy , Mosvik , Verran and Levanger bought shares , as well as guaranteeing 20 % of the deficits . Nord @-@ Trøndelag County Municipality bought shares , but did not want to issue guarantees . Innherredsferja was established with a share capital of NOK 144 @,@ 000 , split between 288 shares . The county bought 100 and became the largest owner , while seven municipalities bought 90 between them . The remaining shares were owned by private individuals and local companies . The company was incorporated on 10 May 1957 . 

 NOK 400 @,@ 000 was borrowed and NOK 510 @,@ 000 invested in a ferry from Moen & Sønns . It arrived at Levanger on 31 December 1957 and was named Innherredsferja . Initial plans were to have a crew of three on the ferry , but this was quickly expanded to five . The single @-@ direction vessel had space for 75 passengers plus vehicles . During the test @-@ run it became clear that the quay at Vangshylla was 75 centimetres ( 30 in ) too narrow to allow the ferry to dock . The first ferry service had ten different route combinations in each direction , and the fees were based on three different zones . Trips within Mosvik , Verran and Inderøy were in Zone 1 , trips to and from Ytterøy were in Zone 2 , while trips from Levanger to Mosvik and Inderøy were within Zone 3 . The initial prices were NOK 1 for one person in Zone 1 , NOK 2 @.@ 50 in Zone 2 and NOK 3 @.@ 5 in Zone 3 . For cars , the prices were NOK 5 , 10 and 14 , respectively . On workdays , the ferry made two round trips to Ytterøy and Levanger , three round trips to Venneshamn and five round trips to Vangshylla and Kjerringvik . At Levanger , both ferries corresponded with north- and southbound trains on the Nordland Line at Levanger Station , which is within walking distance of the quay . At Vangshylla , there were buses operated by Fylkesbilene i Nord @-@ Trøndelag to Steinkjer and Røra Station . 

 Operations commenced on 1 February 1958 . After five days , the service had to stop because of technical problems with the engine , and it took a week before it resumed . The quay at Levanger was not suitable , because the ferry could not dock at low tide . This caused the ferry to dock at the main dock to disembark passengers , whilst unloading the vehicles had to wait until high tide . In the first twelve months of operation , the ferry transported 9 @,@ 411 vehicles , of which 4 @,@ 000 were cars , and 40 @,@ 000 passengers . By 1961 , the number of cars had increased to 9 @,@ 374 . During 1958 , the company employed ticket sellers at the quays . A new ferry , Innherredsferja II , was ordered from Ulstein Mekaniske Verksted , and entered service on 1 August 1962 . The 27 metres ( 89 ft ) long vessel cost NOK 1 @,@ 062 @,@ 000 . It had a capacity for sixteen cars or six trucks . Part of the rationale for purchasing the new ferry was the increased traffic across Skarnsund following the completion of National Road 755 from Mosvik to Leksvik , which made the ferry the fastest link for people from Leksvik traveling to Levanger . 


 = = = Two routes = = = 


 Discussion about splitting the route into two started in the early in 1960s . The Public Roads Administration felt that it was unnecessary to have a cross @-@ fjord service , as at the time there was a road from Vangshylla to Levanger which sufficed . The administration was also in the process of building a road from Kjerringvik to Venneshamn , which would allow the ferry to drop that service . On 1 June 1964 , the service was split in two : Vangshylla – Kjerringvik and Hokstad – Levanger . At the same time , the service was upgraded to a national road connection , and the full responsibility for funding was transferred to the ministry . The Vangshylla – Kjerringvik service was taken over by Innherredsferja , while the Hokstad – Levanger service was taken over by Innherredsferja II . In 1968 , the state granted sufficient guarantees to allow a new ferry to be purchased . In the same year , the road from Framverran via Venneshamn to Kjerringvik was opened . The new ferry was similar to Innherredsferja II ; it was built in Kristiansund for NOK 1 @,@ 555 @,@ 000 and originally named Skarnsund . Innherredsferja was sold to an operator in Agder for NOK 50 @,@ 000 . At the same time , Fremverran and Venneshamn were transferred from the municipality of Verran to Mosvik , while Ytterøy , Skogn and Frol merged with Levanger . 

 In 1970 , the ferries were equipped with televisions . The following year , the company had a deficit of NOK 1 @.@ 1 million . It transported 195 @,@ 000 passengers , of which 120 @,@ 000 took the Vangshylla – Kjerringvik service . Mobile telephones came into use in January 1972 . In 1973 , the service was reduced as a result of the oil crisis , which lasted until 1 March 1974 . Smoking indoors was banned from 1975 , and a new quay was built in Levanger and opened on 1 July 1976 . Local disagreement about the location of a new quay on Ytterøy delayed construction , and it did not open until 1981 . In 1974 , planning for a new ferry on the Ytterøy service started , although the order was not placed until June 1979 . The new ferry , Ytterøy , cost NOK 10 @.@ 5 million , had space for 30 cars and was bi @-@ directional . It was put into service in February 1981 . Innherredsferja II was kept as a reserve . 

 The need for a larger ferry on the Skarnsund service was also pressing . Cars often had to wait , and if the ferry sailed with full capacity , there was no room for passengers to leave their vehicles . Work to procure a new ferry to replace Skarnsund started in 1981 . This resulted in the acquisition of the second @-@ hand ferry Mosvik from Bergen , with a capacity of 24 cars , which entered service starting 9 December 1982 . Skarnsund was leased to Namsos Trafikkselskap . In 1982 , tickets for a single trip on the Skarnsund Ferry were NOK 5 for an adult and NOK 14 for a car with driver . On the Ytterøy service , it was NOK 7 and 25 , respectively . Discounts were available , up to 33 % for cars and 50 % for trucks and buses . 


 = = = New times at Skarnsund = = = 


 Mosvik proved to be too small , with 3 @,@ 000 cars being left at the quays at Vangshylla and Kjerringvik in 1986 . An additional 47 were not catered for on the Ytterøy service in the same year . The order for Skarnsund II , costing NOK 27 million , was signed in December 1987 , and put into service in 1988 . Skarnsund was sold to Namsos Trafikkselskap for NOK 1 , as was Mosvik for NOK 1 million . The following year , Verran Municipality sold its shares in the company . In 1990 , the subsidy system was changed , and the company received a fixed subsidy instead of the state covering the deficit . This allowed the company to make a profit , if it managed to rationalize operations . 

 The first meeting of local commercial and political interests to establish a bridge across Skarnsund was held in 1972 . By 1983 , it was formalized by the establishment of the company AS Skarnsundsbrua to finance construction . The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1986 , and construction started two years later . The bridge cost NOK 200 million , and was opened by King Harald V on 19 December 1991 , after he had taken the last ferry across the fjord . 

 In 1991 , Fosen Trafikklag purchased Inderøy Municipality 's shares in Innherredferja , while Verran Sparebank bought those previously owned by Mosvik Municipality . In its last year of operation , the Skarnsund service carried 267 @,@ 894 people , 108 @,@ 482 cars , 13 @,@ 878 trucks , 840 buses and 312 motorcycles . Skarnsund II was sold to Namsos Trafikkselskap for NOK 23 @,@ 357 @,@ 778 . In 1992 , the annual meeting had to be postponed due to a ferry strike , which prevented the shareholders from Ytterøy attending . Levanger Municipality and Nord @-@ Trøndelag County Municipality were the only remaining public shareholders , and in 1992 Levanger announced that they intended to sell the Trondheim @-@ based ferry operator Fosen Trafikklag . However , the politicians changed their mind , and the municipality remained as a shareholder . In 1994 , both ferries were out of service and a small passenger ferry was used for a few days . In 1996 , the company was again hit by a strike . Normally the service was not chosen to be subject to strikes due to the high regularity needed by the chicken manufacturer Trønderkylling , who would otherwise have to proceed with unnecessary slaughtering of animals . In 1997 , a cooperation with Fosen Trafikklag started , including the two using a shared reserve ferry , Austråt . 


 = = = Cooperation and competition = = = 


 In 2000 , Innherredsferja started to work on proposals to purchase a new ferry . The following year , it chose to buy Torghatten for NOK 19 @.@ 2 million from Torghatten Trafikkselskap , and renamed it Ytterøy II . It was taken into service on 9 November 2002 , andInnherredsferja II was sold . At the same time , Innherredsferja and Fosen Trafikklag amended their agreement , whereby Ytterøy , stationed at Levanger , became the shared reserve ferry . This meant that if a reserve vessel was needed for the Flakk – Rørvik Ferry , Ytterøy II would be sent there , and Ytterøy used for the Levanger – Hokstad service . From 1 January 2003 , the Levanger – Hokstad Ferry was one of six services which were part of a national test project where the fees for cars were increased , while passengers traveled free . The project included larger discounts for large users . The scheme was terminated in 2006 . A new ferry quay at Levanger was opened in 2003 , with a larger waiting area and ramp . The ramp also had separate sections for walk @-@ on passengers and cars . A terminal building was built with a waiting room and toilets , as well as offices for Innherredsferja . The terminal was 160 square metres ( 1 @,@ 700 sq ft ) in two stories and cost NOK 1 @.@ 8 million . From the ground , the building was built to symbolize a lighthouse , while from above it appears shaped like a fish . 

 In 2004 , Bondevik 's Second Cabinet and Liberal Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm decided that all ferry services in Norway would become subject to public service obligation ( PSO ) . Innherredsferja held a concession until the end of 2006 , but would have to bid for the service from 1 January 2007 . The company would need expertise in both bidding and increased share capital to succeed in the bidding . By then , Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25 % of the company , and the county and the municipality sold their shares to Fosen . Following this , a meeting was held on Ytterøy , where Fosen succeeded in securing a sufficient number of shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company . This valued the company at NOK 23 @.@ 1 million . Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares . From 1 July 2005 , Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen , but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board . 

 The Ytterøy service was packaged with the Brekstad – Valset Ferry — located further out in the fjord than the Flakk – Rørvik Ferry . In the initial contract proposal from the Public Roads Administration , it was considered acceptable that Ytterøy could be without a ferry service for up to 24 hours , should there be technical difficulties with the vessel . After massive local protests — arguing that Brekstad residents had the option to take the Flakk – Rørvik Ferry — the Ytterøy this delay was reduced to 2 hours and it was specified that the reserve ferry had to be stationed at Levanger . In 2005 , the Public Roads Administration declared that Nor @-@ Ferjer , a joint venture between Stavangerske and Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap had won the bid . Innherredsferja continued to operate until their concession ran out , after which Ytterøy II and the terminal in Levanger were sold . All but three of the employees received jobs with Nor @-@ Ferjer . Until 2008 , Innherredsferja remained a paper company until the sale of Ytterøy was completed and liquidation completed . The company never had any serious accidents during its history .

 MF Innherredsferja was the company 's first vessel . She was a single @-@ direction vessel built at Moen & Sønns Båtbyggeri in Risør . She arrived at Levanger on 31 December 1957 and cost NOK 510 @,@ 000 , and was not equipped with radar . She was initially used for the cross @-@ fjord route ; from 1962 she was used as a reserve until put into service on the Skarnsund route in 1964 .

 = Russian battleship Imperator Nikolai I = 


 Imperator Nikolai I ( Russian : Император Николай I ) was a Russian Imperator Aleksandr II @-@ class battleship built for the Baltic Fleet in the late 1880s . She participated in the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America in New York City in 1892 . She assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and visited Toulon in October 1893 . She sailed for the Pacific Ocean during the First Sino @-@ Japanese War and remained in the Pacific until late 1896 , when she returned to the Mediterranean Squadron and supported Russian interests during the Cretan Revolt . She returned to the Baltic in April 1898 and had a lengthy refit , which replaced all of her machinery , before returning to the Mediterranean in 1901 . 

 Returning to the Baltic during the Russo @-@ Japanese War Imperator Nikolai I was refitted in late 1904 to serve as the flagship of the Third Pacific Squadron under Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov . She was slightly damaged during the Battle of Tsushima and was surrendered , along with most of the Third Pacific Squadron , by Admiral Nebogatov to the Japanese the following day . She was taken into the Imperial Japanese Navy under the new name of Iki ( 壱岐 ) and she served as a gunnery training ship until 1910 and then became a first @-@ class coast defense ship and training vessel . She was sunk as a target ship in October 1915 . 


 = = Development = = 


 Imperator Nikolai I was originally intended as a smaller ship than her half @-@ sister Imperator Aleksandr II along the lines of the Brazilian battleship Riachuelo , but armed with 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns . A contract was signed on 6 November 1885 with the Baltic Works for a 7 @,@ 572 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 7 @,@ 694 t ) ship armed with two 12 @-@ inch guns in a forward barbette . However , this was quickly cancelled and a contract was quickly let with the Franco @-@ Russian Works for a repeat of Imperator Aleksandr II even though the earlier ship had been built by the Baltic Works . The Franco @-@ Russian Works had difficulties getting the drawings and was forced to redraft some of them . They took the opportunity to change the design in a number of relatively minor ways while doing so . However , the substitution of a gun turret for Imperator Aleksandr II 's barbette mount was made in 1887 , well after the start of construction and proved problematic . The design of the turret was not finalized until April 1889 and work on the forward part of the hull had to cease for more than six months because the dimensions of the turret were not yet known . The turret proved to be 44 @.@ 9 long tons ( 46 t ) heavier than the older ship 's barbette and made Imperator Nikolai I slightly bow @-@ heavy despite a reduction in the height of the belt armor in compensation . 


 = = Description = = 


 Imperator Nikolai I was 333 feet 6 inches ( 101 @.@ 65 m ) long at the waterline and 346 feet 6 inches ( 106 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 66 feet 11 inches ( 20 m ) and a draft of 24 feet 3 inches ( 7 @.@ 4 m ) , 1 foot 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 4 m ) more than designed . She displaced 9 @,@ 594 long tons ( 9 @,@ 748 t ) at load , over 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 016 t ) more than her designed displacement of 8 @,@ 440 long tons ( 8 @,@ 575 t ) . 

 Imperator Nikolai I had two triple @-@ cylinder vertical compound steam engines , each driving a single propeller . Twelve cylindrical boilers provided non @-@ superheated steam to the engines . They were built by Baltic Works and had a total designed output of 8 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 5 @,@ 966 kW ) . On trials , the powerplant produced a total of 7 @,@ 842 indicated horsepower ( 5 @,@ 848 kW ) , and a top speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . She carried 847 long tons ( 861 t ) of coal that gave her a range of 2 @,@ 630 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 870 km ; 3 @,@ 030 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 

 The main armament of the Imperator Aleksandr II @-@ class ships was a pair of 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) Obukhov Model 1877 30 @-@ caliber guns . Imperator Nikolai I carried hers in a twin @-@ gun turret forward . The four 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) Obukhov Model 1877 35 @-@ caliber guns were on center @-@ pivot mounts in casemates at the corners of the citadel , the hull given a pronounced tumblehome to increase their arcs of fire ahead and behind . The eight 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) Model 1877 35 @-@ caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts . Four were fitted between the 9 @-@ inch guns and could traverse a total of 100 ° . The others were mounted at each end of the ship where they could fire directly ahead or astern . The ten 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in hull embrasures of the ship , between the nine and six @-@ inch guns to defend against torpedo boats . Four 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in each fighting top . Imperator Nikolai I carried six above @-@ water 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes . One was in the bow , two tubes were on each broadside and a tube was in the stern . 

 Most of Imperator Nikolai I 's armor was imported from the United Kingdom and some deliveries were delayed which caused problems during construction . The height of the waterline armor belt was reduced 6 inches ( 152 mm ) in comparison to that of her half @-@ sister , being 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) tall , of which 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) was above the designed waterline and 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) below . Most of the rest of the protection matched that of Imperator Aleksandr II other than the waterline belt forward which only reduced to a minimum of six inches rather than the 3 @.@ 9 inches ( 99 mm ) of the older ship and the walls of the conning tower were only six inches thick , 2 inches ( 51 mm ) less than her half @-@ sister . 


 = = History = = 


 Imperator Nikolai I was named after the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia . She was built by the Franco @-@ Russian Works at Saint Petersburg . She was laid down on 4 August 1886 , launched on 1 June 1889 , and completed in July 1891 , although her trials lasted until the spring of 1892 . She sailed in June 1892 for New York City to participate in the celebration honoring the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America . Upon her departure she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and visited Toulon in October 1893 with the Russian Squadron to reinforce the Franco @-@ Russian Alliance . She was then commanded by Captain Richard Dicker . She sailed for the Pacific Ocean during the First Sino @-@ Japanese War and arrived at Nagasaki , Japan on 28 April 1895 , before sailing for Chefoo in China . She remained in the Pacific until late 1896 , when she returned to the Mediterranean Squadron and supported Russian interests during the Cretan Revolt . She returned to the Baltic in April 1898 for an extensive , multi @-@ year , refit . Her machinery was replaced with Belleville water @-@ tube boilers and vertical triple expansion steam engines . Her after superstructure was cut down one deck abaft the mainmast and most of her 47 mm and 37 mm revolving cannon were removed . Only two 37 mm revolvers were retained and she received sixteen 47 mm and two 37 mm single @-@ barreled guns in their place . 

 She returned to the Mediterranean in September 1901 and remained there until the Russo @-@ Japanese War when she was transferred to the Baltic to be refitted in late 1904 to serve as the flagship of the Third Pacific Squadron under Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov . The squadron departed Liepāja on 15 January 1905 for the Pacific . She was slightly damaged during the Battle of Tsushima , receiving one hit from a twelve @-@ inch gun , two from eight @-@ inch guns and two from six @-@ inch guns , and suffered only 5 killed and 35 men wounded . She was surrendered , along with most of the Third Pacific Squadron , by Admiral Nebogatov the following day . On 6 June 1905 , she was taken into the Imperial Japanese Navy and renamed Iki , after Iki Island in the Sea of Japan , near site of the Battle of Tsushima . She served as a gunnery training ship until 12 December 1910 when she was redesignated as a first @-@ class coast defense ship and a training vessel . Some of her 6 @-@ inch guns were removed in 1910 and replaced by six 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) 45 @-@ caliber guns and some 76 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) 12 @-@ pounder guns were also added . She was stricken 1 May 1915 and sunk as a target by the battlecruisers Kongō and Hiei , although Watts and Gordon say that she was scrapped in 1922 . 



 = 2009 – 10 Duquesne Dukes men 's basketball team = 


 The 2009 – 10 Duquesne Dukes men 's basketball team represented Duquesne University in National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I ( D @-@ I ) college basketball during the 2009 – 10 season . 

 Duquesne hoped to build on the success of the 2008 – 09 season and began the new year with five straight victories . Soon , however , a string of setbacks hit the team , including the loss of two players , one due to injury and the other to suspension . Duquesne lost its final non @-@ conference game and slipped into a five @-@ game losing streak . The team did manage to break the streak , but had trouble gaining any momentum . In mid @-@ February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21 point victory over La Salle , followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte , which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time , and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd . However , Duquesne then lost its final two road games of the season . 

 Despite its lackluster season 's end , Duquesne won an invitation to the College Basketball Invitational postseason tournament . The team lost to the Princeton Tigers , and the Dukes were eliminated in the first round , ending the 2009 season . 


 = = Duquesne University = = 


 Duquesne University , also called Duquesne University of the Holy Spirit , is a private Catholic university in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States . The University 's Duquesne Dukes compete in NCAA Division I ( D @-@ I ) . D @-@ I schools are generally the major collegiate athletic powers , with larger budgets , more elaborate facilities , and higher numbers of athletic scholarships in comparison to Division II and III . This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA , and the Division II and III levels , the College Division ; this terminology was replaced with the current numeric ( I , II , III ) divisions in 1973 . 

 The Dukes have played twice in national championship games in the 1950s and won the National Invitation Tournament championship in 1955 , when the NIT was the premier collegiate basketball tournament in the country . The men 's basketball Dukes annually play its cross @-@ town rival , the University of Pittsburgh Panthers , in Pittsburgh 's highly anticipated and well @-@ attended City Game . The current head coach is Ron Everhart , who has a two @-@ year record of 27 – 32 ( 13 – 19 in the Atlantic 10 Conference ) . Well @-@ known Duquesne players of the past include All @-@ Americans Chuck Cooper , Sihugo Green , Dick Ricketts and Willie Somerset , and Norm Nixon , who won the Most Outstanding Player in Duquesne 's 57 – 54 victory over the Villanova Wildcats in the 1977 Atlantic 10 Men 's Basketball Tournament . 


 = = Preseason = = 


 Duquesne lost only one starter , Aaron Jackson , from the 2008 – 09 team which ended with a record of 21 – 13 , the first time since 1981 that the school had 20 or more wins in a season . Picked to finish 12th in the Atlantic 10 , Duquesne went on to finish second , losing to Temple by only five points in the conference championship game . This earned Duquesne a bid into the National Invitation Tournament , its first postseason appearance since 1994 . The team was eliminated in a double @-@ overtime first round loss to Virginia Tech , but the Dukes ' unlikely success inspired the hope of a return to the NIT , or perhaps even the NCAA tournament . 

 On May 12 , 2009 the school announced that two freshman forwards , Shawntez Patterson and Aleksandar Milovic , had been released from their scholarships and cleared to transfer to other schools . Both saw limited action in the 2008 season . Shawntez Patterson transferred to Pensacola Junior College , and Aleksandar Milovic transferred to the University of Hawaii . 

 Andre Marhold , a small forward and the first of two incoming freshmen , signed with Duquesne on April 16 . Marhold , a native of Pittsburgh who moved to North Carolina for High School , averaged 17 @.@ 0 points and 10 @.@ 0 rebounds per game his senior year , in which his team was the regular season champion . He was ranked 188 in the top 1000 high school seniors by Hoop Scoop . Marhold turned down scholarship offers from Clemson , Charlotte , and Purdue . 

 Several weeks later on May 13 , guard Sean Johnson of Queens , New York also signed with the team . He attended Christ the King high school , whose basketball team finished his senior year ranked fourth in the state and eleventh in the nation by ESPN . He averaged 22 @.@ 4 points per game and was named New York City Catholic High School Athletic Association Most Valuable Player . Johnson also received scholarship offers from Nebraska , Manhattan , and Quinnipiac . 

 Prior to the start of the season , ESPN picked Duquesne to finish fifth in the Atlantic 10 conference , noting the loss of star Aaron Jackson but looking with optimism at the addition of 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) center Morakinyo Williams and the continued development of other stars . Sophomore Melquan Bolding was also highlighted by ESPN as a key player in the Atlantic 10 .

 The Dukes played their first game of the season on November 7 in an exhibition match against Division III La Roche . Duquesne scored a 47 @-@ point victory in which Damian Saunders led in scoring with 17 points . Despite the solid win , Duquesne made only 47 @.@ 6 % from the free throw line , a trend which haunted the team the rest of the season . 

 The regular season home @-@ opener was another victory for the team , as they defeated Nicholls State 85 – 62 on November 13 . Early in the game , Melquan Bolding hit the floor on a hard foul during a breakaway . After a few minutes , he recovered and went on to lead the team with 25 points . Saunders scored 17 points with 19 rebounds , his first of a long streak of double @-@ doubles . This game was also the second and final game of B.J. Monteiro 's 2 @-@ game suspension following allegations of participating in a robbery . Three days later , it was announced that Bolding had fractured his wrist when he was fouled , and would be unable to play for 4 – 6 weeks . 

 Despite the loss of Bolding , the team went on the road to face Iowa on November 17 , with newly returned B.J. Monteiro starting in place of Melquan Bolding . When down 49 – 50 with 11 @.@ 7 seconds left , Bill Clark took an off @-@ balance 3 @-@ point shot which spun in , putting the team up 52 – 50 and sealing their second victory of the regular season . This was Duquesne 's first ever victory at a Big Ten arena , and its first victory against a Big Ten school since a win over Illinois in 1973 .

 The team then traveled to Cullowhee , North Carolina for three games as part of the O 'Reilly Auto Parts CBE Classic . Duquesne defeated Binghamton 70 – 52 to extend its record to 3 – 0 , with Saunders leading the way with 24 points . The next day the team improved to 4 – 0 with an overtime 75 – 72 victory against Division II Arkansas @-@ Monticello . On the third day of play , Duquesne finally lost to Western Carolina , 77 – 83 .

 The Dukes then returned home , where they faced Radford on November 29 . B.J. Monteiro continued to perform well as a starter in replacing Melquan Bolding , leading the team with 21 points . Next up for the team was the annual City Game match @-@ up between Duquesne and its crosstown rival Pitt . In front of 12 @,@ 336 fans at the Mellon Arena , Duquesne sprang out to a 16 @-@ point lead before slipping and losing 58 – 67 in double overtime .

 On December 5 , Duquesne hosted the Chuck Cooper Classic , in which it defeated the Savannah State Tigers by a score of 58 – 44 . Eric Evans led with 17 points and Damian Saunders contributed 15 .

 Four days later , the Dukes were blown out 39 – 68 by # 7 West Virginia . Saunders led the team with only 12 points . One analyst attributed this loss to the skill of the Mountaineers , an abysmal night by star Bill Clark , as well as the continued absence of Melquan Bolding and now senior captain Jason Duty , who missed the game with a sprained ankle . 

 On December 12 the Dukes faced off against another local rival , Robert Morris . In a 59 – 54 win , B.J. Monteiro again led the team with 17 points . Monteiro 's continued high level of play prompted some analysts , as well as fans , to wonder whether the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench , or if someone else would lose their starting position . Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86 – 77 victory at home . Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points .

 The team then traveled to Indianapolis , where they lost to IUPUI 64 – 73 , despite a career high 20 points from Eric Evans . In their final game before a short Christmas break , Duquesne defeated the Saint Francis Red Flash 86 – 56 . Damian Saunders scored his tenth double @-@ double , making him the national leader in that statistic , as well as second in rebounds . Following the break , Duquesne lost its final non @-@ conference game to the Old Dominion Monarchs by a score of 54 – 63 , the first of a five @-@ game losing streak . Saunders still managed to post his eleventh double @-@ double , coming just one block short of what would have been only the second triple @-@ double in school history . 


 = = = Early conference play = = = 


 Duquesne opened conference play on January 6 in a match against the Richmond Spiders , a team which the Dukes had not defeated since the Spiders joined the Atlantic 10 in 2001 . This game marked the return of Melquan Bolding , though he did not start and scored only three points in fourteen minutes of playing time . Richmond managed to extend their streak , defeating the Dukes 86 – 80 , while Saunders maintained his nation @-@ leading position and now placed eighth in both blocks and steals . Duquesne then traveled to Dayton , Ohio where they lost to the Dayton Flyers 72 – 78 in overtime in front of a crowd of 13 @,@ 435 , the largest crowd the team would see all season . Senior Jason Duty was fouled on a 3 @-@ point attempt at the end of the game when his team was down by one , but made only one of three foul shots , sending the game into overtime . Melquan Bolding scored 13 points in 36 minutes , though he did not start , and Saunders came into the game now leading the nation in rebounds . 

 Duquesne found itself in overtime once again as they dropped another game against the St. Louis Billikens in double overtime , 75 – 79 . Melquan Bolding suffered another setback as he sat out most of the game , playing only five minutes due to strep throat . The team then went back out on the road to face the Rhode Island Rams , where they again lost with a final score of 67 – 75 , dropping their conference record to 0 – 4 . Bill Clark missed a game for the first time in his college career due to a suspension on suspicion of a " secondary NCAA rules violation . " Melquan Bolding started the game for the first time since his injury , but only scored 6 points .

 Two days later , Clark was reinstated . With Clark back in the lineup for a home game against St. Bonaventure Bonnies , Ron Everhart tried a new starting lineup : one that included Bolding and Monteiro , but left Senior Jason Duty on the bench . The Dukes took a 15 point lead at half time , but the Bonnies came back . With less than thirty seconds left , Bill Clark drew a charging penalty which gave his team the ball , down by two . One quick possession by each team left it 67 – 69 in favor of the Bonnies . On the final play , Damian Saunders drove towards the basket before passing it out to Melquan Bolding , who hit a 3 @-@ point shot to put the Dukes up by one with 3 @.@ 5 seconds remaining . Duquesne won 70 – 69 , giving them their first win since December 22 . 

 The winning feeling was short @-@ lived , however , as the Dukes were shut down by the Xavier Musketeers on January 28 , losing 86 – 50 . Melquan Bolding led the team with 14 points , Damian Saunders scored only 6 , and Bill Clark only 4 . On January 31 the team pulled out a 74 – 71 win against the Saint Joseph 's Hawks at home , with Melquan Bolding leading the team with 24 points .

 Once again , though , the Dukes were unable to build momentum as they lost 60 – 76 to # 19 ranked Temple . Bill Clark and Eric Evans led the team with just 12 points each . On February 6 , the Dukes braved a blizzard for a game against the George Washington Colonials in Washington , D.C .. Saunders led the way to a 70 – 63 win with a career @-@ high 27 points . Returning home on February 11 to face the Massachusetts Minutemen , the Dukes were unable to win two consecutive games for the third straight time , losing 80 – 84 . Damian Saunders scored 15 points , but was injured and left the game for a while ; when he returned , he did not score in the remainder of his playing time . He did , however , become Duquesne 's 33rd player to pass the 1 @,@ 000 career points mark . 


 = = = Introducing the 10 – 40 , Charlotte , and a rematch with Dayton = = = 


 Duquesne enjoyed another game at home on February 14 against the La Salle Explorers . Ron Everhart sought a new strategy for his team , which was struggling in conference play . In this game , La Salle was missing three players , leaving them with an active roster of only eight players . Duquesne ran a 10 – 40 pattern , in which two squads of five players execute short , intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad . At first , Duquesne fell behind by 14 points , but the strategy paid off as La Salle 's players tired . With La Salle fatigued , Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation and went on to win 103 – 82 . Bill Clark scored a career high 34 points , and also surpassed the 1 @,@ 000 point mark . 

 As underdogs on the road against the Charlotte 49ers , the Dukes ' new 10 – 40 strategy led them to an 83 – 77 upset victory . This was the first time of the season the team had managed to win two consecutive conference games . On February 21 , Duquesne again returned home for a nationally @-@ televised game against the Dayton Flyers . Senior Jason Duty was honored in a pre @-@ game ceremony , and the game 's attendance of 5 @,@ 144 was only 214 short of the A.J. Palumbo Center 's capacity . A late layup drive by Damian Saunders put the Dukes up by one , and they went on to win 73 – 71 . 


 = = = Ending the regular season = = = 


 Duquesne was unable to extend its streak on the road against St. Louis , as they lost 59 – 69 . Bill Clark led the team with 17 points and Saunders grabbed four steals , enough to raise his per @-@ game average to 2 @.@ 9 , a nation @-@ leading figure . With this , Saunders had at one point led the nation in double @-@ doubles , rebounds , and steals . The Dukes lost again , 80 – 92 , in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure . The loss put a damper on Duquesne 's hopes for a home game in the first round of the Atlantic 10 tournament , as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position . 

 Duquesne closed its season against Fordham , who had yet to win a conference game and had only won two games all season . Fordham was hungry for a win , and a lack of effective defense on both sides led to a high scoring 111 – 100 victory for Duquesne . Melquan Bolding and Eric Evans both posted career high scores of 32 and 23 , respectively . 


 = = Postseason = = 


 After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure , the Bonnies also lost their final regular season game to Xavier , which left the two teams in a tie for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it . The two teams had played each other twice during the season , with each team taking one victory , so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory . Duquesne 's best win came against Charlotte , while Saint Bonaventure 's was against Rhode Island . Unfortunately , those two teams were also in a tie . So for Duquesne to get their home game , Charlotte had to win their final home game , and Rhode Island had to lose . Both teams lost , so the tie remained and Rhode Island won out due to their head @-@ to @-@ head records . Thus Duquesne would head back out on the road against the Bonnies . 

 The game was played on March 9 and was close until the Bonnies went on a 14 – 0 run halfway into the second half , going on to win 71 – 83 . Despite Damian Saunders posting his 20th and final double @-@ double of the year , Duquesne 's 5 for 21 performance from beyond the 3 @-@ point arc combined with St. Bonaventure 's 75 % 3 @-@ point shooting and two players scoring in the upper twenties put the game out of the Dukes ' reach . The loss dashed Duquesne 's last hopes at a bid to the NIT . However , an invitation to either the College Basketball Invitational ( CBI ) or CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament was still possible . 

 Early on March 15 , hours after the NCAA and NIT fields were announced , Duquesne accepted a bid into the CBI . This would be Duquesne 's 23rd postseason appearance and first in the CBI , which started in 2008 . This also marked the first time since 1981 that the Dukes made two consecutive postseason appearances . It was announced that the Dukes would face off against the Princeton Tigers at Jadwin Gymnasium on March 17 . 

 On Tuesday , March 16 , it was announced that Junior Bill Clark had been suspended indefinitely from the team due to " conduct " issues . Clark had not attended practice the day before and would not travel to Princeton with the team for the CBI opening game on Wednesday . This would be only the second game that Bill Clark has missed in his college career . 

 Duquesne suffered its final disappointment of the season on March 17 as it fell to the Princeton Tigers . Bill Clark remained suspended and Damian Saunders led the team with only 14 points . Duquesne dominated the game early on , taking a 20 – 11 lead before Princeton came back , eventually leading 28 – 23 at the half . The Dukes were unable to turn the momentum and continued to fall behind , eventually losing 51 – 65 . The absence of Bill Clark showed on defense , as the Dukes were out @-@ rebounded heavily . The Dukes also failed to improve on their issues from the regular season , going only 8 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 15 from 3 @-@ point range . This loss ended the 2009 season , and all Duquesne could do was look ahead to the next year .

 Duquesne was plagued by a few issues during the 2009 season . Most notable were the poor free @-@ throw and 3 @-@ point shooting percentages . Duquesne was last in the Atlantic 10 in both of these categories at 60 @.@ 8 % and 26 @.@ 3 % respectively . Despite their poor performance shooting from beyond the 3 @-@ point line , Duquesne still shot the fourth most three @-@ pointers of all teams in the Atlantic 10 . The following chart displays player per @-@ game average statistics for the regular season and Atlantic 10 tournament .

 Duquesne players received a few accolades in the 2009 – 10 season . Junior Damian Saunders 's outstanding play earned him a spot on the Atlantic 10 All @-@ Conference First Team . He was also named the Atlantic 10 Defensive Player of the Year . Earlier in the season , Jason Duty was nominated as a finalist for the Lowe 's Senior CLASS award , an award which recognizes college seniors who demonstrate exemplary outstanding performance both on the court and in the classroom . Duty , who held a 3 @.@ 72 GPA as an accounting major and had already accepted a job with PricewaterhouseCoopers , was named to the Atlantic 10 All @-@ Academic Team . 

 Early in the season , Damian Saunders was named Atlantic 10 ( A @-@ 10 ) player of the week for two consecutive weeks , sharing the honors with Chris Wright of Dayton and Jordan Crawford of Xavier , respectively . Following his 34 @-@ point performance against La Salle , Bill Clark earned his first career A @-@ 10 Player of the Week award , with Richmond 's Kevin Anderson . 

 The season was also marred by a few controversies . Prior to the beginning of play , B.J. Monteiro was arrested on October 3 in Middletown , Connecticut . He turned himself into police on suspicion of participating in the theft of a laptop , iPod , and cash from a house during a party in early August . He was charged with third @-@ degree larceny and , on October 6 , he was suspended indefinitely from the team . Following his court appearance on October 13 , all charges were dropped and Monteiro was reinstated to the team . 

 In late January , Junior Bill Clark was benched for the game against Rhode Island as the NCAA investigated a potential secondary rules violation . The specific details of the incident were not released by Duquesne , even after Clark 's return to the team the next day . A secondary rules violation is defined as " one that is isolated or inadvertent in nature , provides or is intended to provide only a minimal recruiting , competitive or other advantage . " 

 In the postseason , Bill Clark was again suspended , this time by coach Everhart for a conduct issue . The day before the CBI game against Princeton , Everhart announced that Clark would not travel to the game or participate in any practices or team activities until he felt the student ready to return . Clark was reinstated two weeks later , and , as before , no details were revealed . 



 = Paul Nobuo Tatsuguchi = 


 Paul Nobuo Tatsuguchi ( 辰口 信夫 , Tatsuguchi Nobuo ) , sometimes mistakenly referred to as Nebu Tatsuguchi ( August 31 , 1911 – May 30 , 1943 ) , was a surgeon in the Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) during World War II . He was killed during the Battle of Attu on Attu Island , Alaska on May 30 , 1943 . 

 A devout Seventh @-@ day Adventist , Tatsuguchi studied medicine and was licensed as a physician in the United States ( US ) . He returned to his native Japan to practice medicine at the Tokyo Adventist Sanitarium , where he received further medical training . In 1941 , he was ordered to cease his medical practice and conscripted into the IJA as an acting medical officer , although he was given an enlisted rather than officer rank because of his American connections . In late 1942 or early 1943 , Tatsuguchi was sent to Attu , which had been occupied by Japanese forces in October 1942 . The United States Army landed on the island on May 11 , 1943 , intending to retake the island from the Japanese . 

 Throughout the ensuing battle , Tatsuguchi kept a diary in which he recorded its events and his struggle to care for the wounded in his field hospital . He was killed on the battle 's final day after the remaining Japanese conducted one last , suicidal charge against the American forces . 

 Tatsuguchi 's diary was recovered by American forces and translated into English . Copies of the translation were widely disseminated and publicized in the US after the battle . The American public was intrigued by a Christian , American @-@ trained doctor serving with Japanese forces on the island and by his apparent participation in assisting with the deaths of wounded Japanese soldiers in his field hospital during the battle 's final days . Translated excerpts from Tatsuguchi 's diary have been widely quoted in Western historical accounts of the battle , especially his final entry in which he recorded a farewell message to his family . 


 = = Early life = = 


 Tatsuguchi 's father , Suichi Tatsuguchi , was born and raised in Hiroshima , Japan , before leaving for the US in 1895 to " explore the new world " . He attended Healdsburg College , later renamed Pacific Union College , in Angwin , California . While attending the college , he was baptized into the Seventh @-@ day Adventist Church . In 1907 , after completing a course of study in dentistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in San Francisco , Suichi Tatsuguchi returned to Hiroshima with plans to serve as a medical missionary . 

 In Hiroshima , Tatsuguchi established a prosperous dental practice and promoted the establishment of the Hiroshima Adventist church . He married Sadako Shibata who was also familiar with the US and spoke fluent English . Suichi and Sadako had three sons and three daughters . All three sons would eventually attend school in the US . The middle son , born on August 31 , 1911 , was given the English name of Paul and the Japanese name of Nobuo , although he was called " Joseph " at home . 


 = = Schooling and marriage = = 


 Paul Nobuo Tatsuguchi graduated from middle school in Hiroshima on March 16 , 1919 . On March 2 , 1923 , he graduated from Travier English Academy . Paul traveled to California and entered Pacific Union College in 1926 and graduated in May 1932 . When his parents both died unexpectedly in 1932 , Paul returned to Japan to help settle the family affairs . He returned to California in 1933 and entered the College of Medical Evangelists at Loma Linda University , completing the course of study in June 1937 . Paul Tatsuguchi then accepted a year 's internship at White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles . While studying in America , Tatsuguchi was regarded by his classmates , who called him " Tatsy " or Paul , as a serious student , friendly but not gregarious . Classmate J. Mudry , a year behind Tatsuguchi at Loma Linda University , later said , " I know him well . I always thought Tatsuguchi — we called him Paul — was quite an American . " 

 On September 8 , 1938 , Tatsuguchi graduated as a Doctor of Medicine and was awarded a California medical license . That same year , he accepted a position at the Tokyo Adventist Sanitarium , an institution founded in part by his father in 1928 . As he would be working with tuberculosis patients in Tokyo , Tatsuguchi spent several more months undergoing postgraduate medical studies in California . Also in 1938 , Tatsuguchi married a childhood friend , Taeko Miyake . Taeko 's parents were serving as Adventist missionaries in Honolulu , Hawaii , while Taeko pursued studies in California . Paul and Taeko departed the U.S. for Japan in 1939 . 


 = = Early military service = = 


 In Tokyo , Tatsuguchi was aware of the rising tensions between Japan and the United States . Although he was strongly loyal to his native country , he also shared with Taeko a love of the US , to which they hoped to return to live someday . Tatsuguchi concentrated on his work at the sanitorium , and , with Taeko , supported activities for the Adventist church , of which they were devout members . In 1940 their first daughter , Joy Misako , was born . 

 Early the next year , the IJA – the conscription authority in Japan – ordered Tatsuguchi to leave his medical practice and report to the First Imperial Guard Regiment ( FIGR ) in Tokyo , where he was inducted with the rank of private on January 10 , 1941 . As he was stationed in Tokyo , Tatsuguchi was occasionally able to visit Taeko and Misako when his duties allowed . Misako said of this time that , " I only have one memory of my father , and that was playing hide and seek with him . " 

 In September 1941 , Tatsuguchi entered the IJA 's medical school . He graduated in October and was promoted to sergeant major , rejoining the FIGR in January 1942 . In the meantime , in December 1941 the Japanese attacked the US Navy base at Pearl Harbor and declared war on the US and its allies . Suspicious of Tatsuguchi 's American background , the IJA never gave him officer status , instead designating him as a non @-@ commissioned acting medical officer . 

 Over the next several months , Tatsuguchi was deployed to the South Pacific in support of IJA units in the Dutch East Indies . During his service , Tatsuguchi kept a diary , recording his first @-@ hand observations of military service as well as his thoughts and feelings about the events in which he was involved . In September 1942 , after learning that he would be reassigned to a combat area in Rabaul , New Britain , he noted in his diary , " I feel very happy and I am determined to do my best " , adding that he was " determined to destroy the enemy force to the very last soldier " . 

 Tatsuguchi reached Rabaul on October 4 , 1942 . His stay there was probably short , for his wife recorded that he joined her in Tokyo that same month prior to being redeployed . Tatsuguchi was unable to tell his wife , now pregnant with their second child , where he would be assigned , but she noticed that he studied maps of the North Pacific area . At one point , he remarked to Taeko that he was going to an area where he might meet some of his former classmates from California . 

 A few weeks after Tatsuguchi left for his new assignment , the IJA delivered a lock of his hair to Taeko . The IJA did this whenever soldiers were sent to a high @-@ risk combat area in case the soldier was killed and it proved impossible to repatriate the remains for proper funeral rites .

 = = = Arrival = = = 


 Japanese forces had first occupied Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands on June 7 , 1942 during the Battle of Midway . They abandoned Attu in September 1942 , but then decided to reoccupy it . A regiment of IJA soldiers from the Northern Sea Detachment ( 北海支隊 , Hokkai Shitai ) , a detachment of Imperial Japanese Navy Special Naval Landing Force troops , and support personnel began arriving on Attu in October 1942 . The total number of Japanese on the island would eventually be between 2 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 900 men . Exactly when Tatsuguchi arrived on Attu is unclear , because he was forbidden from specifying dates in the letters he wrote to Taeko , but it was probably between November 1942 and January 1943 . He was assigned to the Northern 5216 Detachment North Sea Defense Hospital . 

 With an American naval blockade in place , mail between Attu and Japan was infrequent and unscheduled . Tatsuguchi received several small packages from Taeko containing cookies and ointment for his skin , which was chafed by Attu 's severe winter winds . Four letters and several postcards from Tatsuguchi reached Taeko . As he was forbidden from discussing his unit 's exact location or mission , Tatsuguchi wrote about the weather , the beauty of the snowy and mountainous landscape around him , and his success in catching fish . He was cheered by the news from Taeko that their second daughter , Laura Mutsuko , was born in February . Tatsuguchi reminded Taeko in his letters to play classical music for their daughters . Whether he kept his diary during this time is unclear , for the only known diary entries by Tatsuguchi began in May , after the American landings to retake the island . 


 = = = Battle of Attu = = = 


 On May 11 , 1943 , the American Seventh Infantry Division began landing on Attu to retake the island from the Japanese . The Japanese commander on Attu , Yasuyo Yamasaki , positioned his troops – who were outnumbered five to one – in the mountains from where they temporarily delayed the Americans ' advance inland . Tatsuguchi 's diary entry on May 12 records the Japanese move into the mountains after the American landings , stating simply " evacuated to the summit . Air raids carried out frequently . Heard loud noise , it is naval gunfire . Prepared battle equipment . " 

 On May 14 , American artillery fired phosphorus smoke shells to mark Japanese positions in the mountains . Many Japanese and many Americans believed these were poison gas shells . Tatsuguchi noted in his diary that , " In the enemy the U.S. Forces used gas but no damage was done on account of strong wind . " 

 Tatsuguchi recorded in his diary that he was forced to move his field hospital into a cave to escape American naval and aerial bombardment . He relocated the hospital and patients several times as the Japanese forces were pushed back by the Americans . His May 17 entry describes one of the moves : 

 At night about 11 : 30 o 'clock under cover of darkness I left the cave . Walked over muddy roads and steep hills of no @-@ man 's land . No matter how far or how much we went we did not get over the pass . Sat down after 30 – 40 steps would sleep dream and wake up , same thing over again . We had few wounded and had to carry them on stretchers . They got frost @-@ bitten feet , did not move after all the effort . After struggling all the time , had expended nine hours , for all this without leaving any patients . 

 Tatsuguchi refers again and again in his diary to the constant , intense attacks by American aircraft and artillery on his comrades ' positions . On May 21 , he noted that he " was strafed when amputating a patient 's arm " and on May 23 that " by naval gun fire a hit was scored on the pillar pole of tents for patients and the tents gave in and killed two instantly . No food for two days . " On May 26 , Tatsuguchi recorded that " there was a ceremony of granting of the Imperial Edict . The last line of Umanose [ Japanese defensive position ] was broken through . No hope for reinforcements . We will die for cause of Imperial Edict . " 


 = = = Final attack and death = = = 


 By May 28 about a thousand Japanese remained , compressed into a small pocket . Yamasaki , apparently realizing that help from Japan was not forthcoming , decided on one last , desperate measure to try to save his command from destruction . On May 29 , Yamasaki organized a surprise attack on American positions . Yamasaki hoped to break through the enemy 's front lines and seize the American artillery batteries , which would then be turned on the rest of the American forces and their ships offshore . Tatsuguchi 's last diary entry records Yamasaki 's order , the disposition of the wounded in his hospital , and a farewell message to his family : 

 Today at 2 o 'clock we assembled at Headquarters , the field hospital took also part . The last assault is to be carried out . All the patients in the hospital were made to commit suicide . I am only 33 years old and I am to die . Have no regrets . Banzai to the Emperor . I am grateful that I have kept the peace in my soul which Enkis [ believed to mean either Christ or the Edict ] bestowed on me at 8 o 'clock . I took care of all patients with a grenade . Goodbye Iaeke [ Taeko ] , my beloved wife , who loved me to the last . Until we meet again grant you God @-@ speed Misaka [ Misako ] , who just became four years old , will grow up unhindered . If I feel sorry for you Takiko [ Mutusko ] born February this year and gone before without seeing your father . Well goodbye Mitsue , Brothers Hocan , Sukoshan , Masachan , Mitichan , goodbye . The number participating in this attack is a little over a thousand . Will try to take enemy artillery position . It seems the enemy will probably make an all @-@ out attack tomorrow . 

 Yamasaki launched his attack early in the morning on May 30 . Although the attack succeeded in penetrating the enemy lines , American rear @-@ area personnel rallied and killed Yamasaki and the majority of his attacking troops . Most of the remaining Japanese then committed suicide ; only 27 were taken prisoner . 

 Two versions exist of how Tatsuguchi died . One version is that he did not participate in the attack . Later in the day on May 30 , two American soldiers , Charles W. Laird and John Hirn , who were searching for remaining Japanese forces following the defeat of Yamasaki 's attack , approached the cave containing Tatsuguchi 's field hospital . Tatsuguchi emerged from the cave , waving his Bible in the direction of the Americans and yelling in English , " Don 't shoot ! I am a Christian ! " Laird heard and understood what Tatsuguchi was saying and withheld fire . Hirn , however , shot and killed Tatsuguchi . Hirn later stated that he could not hear what Tatsuguchi was saying over the wind and noise of battle and that he thought that the Bible Tatsuguchi was holding was a weapon . 

 The other version was told to Taeko and Laura by Charles Laird in 1984 . Laird , a former US Army sergeant who served on Attu , stated that he was sleeping in a tent the morning of May 30 when Yamasaki 's troops broke through the American front lines . A man ran into Laird 's tent and Laird shot and killed him , only to discover that the man was American . Then he saw eight Japanese soldiers approaching through the fog , so he shot and killed them too . One of them was Tatsuguchi . Laird said that he found Tatsuguchi 's diary and an address book in which he was shocked to see American names and addresses . 

 J. Mudry and another of Tatsuguchi 's Loma Linda classmates , J. L. Whitaker , were medical officers with the US Seventh Division on Attu during the battle . Whitaker was in the path of Yamasaki 's final attack , but survived without injury . Whitaker and Mudry were stunned to later learn that their former classmate was on the island with Japanese forces and was killed nearby . 


 = = Diary = = 


 After Tatsuguchi 's death his Japanese diary , as well as his Bible , a copy of Gray 's Anatomy and an address book , were forwarded to the division intelligence section . There , an American Nisei serviceman named Yasuo Sam Umetani drafted the first translation of the diary . 

 Word of the diary 's contents spread quickly through divisional headquarters to the other American troops on Attu . Americans were intrigued by the news that an American @-@ trained doctor had been with the Japanese forces on the island and that Tatsuguchi had described the battle from a Japanese perspective . Unauthorized copies of both Umetani 's version and subsequent translations , some of which contained variations , were passed around among the American troops on Attu and to military installations on other Aleutian islands . Civilian crews of transport ships in the area who obtained copies of the diary translation took their copies with them back to the continental US , where it drew the attention of the press and gained wide public exposure . 

 Simon Bolivar Buckner , Jr. the US commander of the Alaska Defense Command ( ADC ) , on learning that the diary claimed that the Americans had used poison gas in the Attu battle , was sufficiently troubled to order that all copies of the translations be confiscated . In transit to Buckner 's headquarters , the diary original itself vanished without trace , and its whereabouts are unknown to this day . Japanese versions are translated from the English translation . In early September 1943 , the ADC 's intelligence section reported that efforts to control the distribution of translated copies of the diary had failed . 

 Several American newspapers published excerpts from the diary , and most highlighted the possibility that Tatsuguchi , a professed Christian , might have been involved in the killing of wounded patients . The Chicago Tribune on September 9 , 1943 published an article headlined " Japs Slew Own Patients on Attu , Diary Discloses " . In contrast , the Loma Linda School of Medicine Alumni Journal defended Tatsuguchi as a gentle and caring doctor who was trapped in a situation beyond his control , where his actions violated neither his religious beliefs nor his oaths as a doctor . Most Western historical accounts of the Battle of Attu mention Tatsuguchi and quote from his diary , especially the final entry . 


 = = Family legacy = = 


 The Japanese government notified Taeko of her husband 's death in August 1943 . Taeko and her two daughters survived the remainder of the war on a small widow 's pension and with help from relatives . Taeko hoped that her husband was still alive and would return . Just after the war ended , B. P. Hoffman , one of Tatsuguchi 's former college instructors and a friend of Taeko 's , visited her in Osaka where she was living . Hoffman told her that a US Federal Bureau of Investigation agent had visited him during the war because Hoffman 's name was in Tatsuguchi 's address book found on Attu . The agent told the story of Tatsuguchi 's death to Hoffman , who related it to Taeko . Taeko accepted that her husband would not be coming back . 

 After the war , Taeko worked for the American occupation forces as a secretary and teacher . In 1954 , she and her two daughters , Joy and Laura , left Japan and joined Taeko 's parents in Hawaii . All three became naturalized citizens of the US . Joy and Laura both attended Pacific Union College and became nurses . Joy later married a Japanese man and returned to Japan to live . Laura married an American and moved to the Los Angeles area , where Taeko later joined her . In 2005 , Taeko told Kyodo News of her husband , " He was a faithful Christian doctor and a gentleman who devoted himself to God and communities . " 

 In May 1993 , Laura traveled to Attu and spoke at a 50th anniversary commemorative event of the Battle of Attu . In her speech at the event , Laura stated " How ironic that my father was killed in combat against his beloved America while in loyal service to his Japanese homeland ... Like my father , I too have a great love for Japan and America . "

 = Pine Middle School shooting = 


 The Pine Middle School shooting was a school shooting that occurred in Reno , Nevada , United States , on March 14 , 2006 . The shooting was perpetrated by then fourteen @-@ year @-@ old student James Scott Newman who shot and injured two 14 @-@ year @-@ old eighth grade classmates with a .38 @-@ caliber revolver that had belonged to his parents . Newman was arrested and charged as an adult on charges of attempted murder , use of a deadly weapon and use of a firearm by a minor but later plead guilty to different charges of two counts of battery with a deadly weapon , in which he had received sentencing as a juvenile . James Newman was sentenced to house arrest until he completed 200 hours of community service . 

 On March 25 , 2008 , athletics teacher Jencie Fagan , who was hailed a hero for her confrontation with the shooter , was selected as one of the three national winners for the Above & Beyond Citizen Honor from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society at a ceremony in Washington , D.C. 


 = = The shooting = = 


 On the day of the shooting , the start of school had been delayed by snow and not all students had arrived when the shooting began . Just before 9 : 00 a.m. ( UTC @-@ 8 ) , fourteen @-@ year @-@ old student James Scott Newman brought his mother 's .38 @-@ caliber revolver to the school in his backpack . He removed the concealed pistol from his coat pocket and loaded it with three .38 caliber rounds while in the bathroom . He chose his target , student Alexander Rueda , 14 , at random in a hallway outside the cafeteria . Before he started firing , a friend of Newman yelled at him to put the gun away , but Newman told him to run . He pulled the trigger twice but the gun did not fire because those chambers were empty . He then fired three times at Rueda . One bullet hit Rueda in the arm and torso , and another ricocheted and hit student Kenzie McKeon , 14 , in the leg from the shrapnel . The two injured students had no prior relationship or arguments with Newman . Several students and teachers heard the shots and the physical education teacher , Jencie Fagan , approached Newman and challenged him . Fagan managed to convince Newman to drop his gun and then restrained him until more staff arrived to help . 

 Alexander Rueda was treated at Washoe Medical Center for his wounds and released the same day , while Kenzie McKeon only needed to be treated at the scene for superficial wounds . The school was placed on lockdown for an hour and then classes were canceled for the remainder of the day . The shooting was the second firearm @-@ related incident on Pine Middle School grounds in two weeks , with the previous incident being a man brandishing a gun towards the campus . On this occasion school administrators sent students home as a precaution . 


 = = = Motive = = = 


 After the shooting , Newman was interviewed by the police and remained determined that he did not want his parents to be present during questioning , however Newman 's father had arrived sometime after to ask for the questioning to stop until a lawyer would be consulted . During questioning Newman stated that he wanted to use the attack as a way to end abuse from his father , brother , and others . He said he was tired of being called " stupid " by them . He researched the Columbine High School massacre on the Internet and planned the attack about a week in advance . He conclusively decided against using a knife because " he did not want to be up close when blood came out of any of the victims . " The night before the attack , Newman 's father had given him a collection of ammunition which included three live .38 caliber rounds . When his parents left the house to eat , he took his mother 's handgun from a small safe in his father 's closet and hid it in his backpack . 


 = = Aftermath = = 


 Following the shooting , police arrested James Newman and booked him as an adult on charges of suspicion of attempted murder , use of a deadly weapon and use of a firearm by a minor in Washoe County Jail with a bail of $ 150 @,@ 000 . However , his trial was put on hold as prosecutors discussed whether he should be tried as an adult or juvenile . Washoe District Attorney Richard Gammick had announced on March 17 that the evidence given did not support Newman being charged as an adult . By May 2006 , Newman was tried as a juvenile by the Jan Evans Juvenile Justice Center for the charges of two counts of battery with a deadly weapon , instead of the initial charges and was put under house arrest until he completed 200 hours of community service . 

 On March 25 , 2008 , Jencie Fagan was selected as one of three national winners and the Nevada finalist for an Above & Beyond Citizen Honor from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society in the Washington , D.C. ceremony , being recognized for her role in prevention of any further incident in the shooting . 



 = Kilgour – Matas report = 


 The Kilgour – Matas report is a 2006 / 2007 investigative report into allegations of live organ harvesting in China conducted by Canadian MP David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas . The report was requested by the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong ( CIPFG ) after allegations emerged that Falun Gong practitioners were secretly having their organs removed against their will at Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital . The report , based on circumstantial evidence , concluded that " there has been , and continues today to be , large @-@ scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners . " China has consistently denied the allegations . 

 The initial report received a mixed reception . In the US , a Congressional Research Service report by Dr. Thomas Lum stated that the Kilgour – Matas report relied largely on logical inference , without bringing forth new or independently obtained testimony ; the credibility of much of the key evidence was said to be questionable . The initial 6 July 2006 report found that , " the source of 41 @,@ 500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained " and concluded that " there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners . " U.N. special rapporteur Manfred Nowak said in March 2007 that the chain of evidence Kilgour and Matas were documenting showed a " coherent picture that causes concern " , which the United Nations Committee Against Torture followed up in November 2008 with a request for " a full explanation of the source of organ transplants " , to investigate the claims of organ harvesting , and to take measures to prosecute those committing abuses . Other investigators , such as Ethan Gutmann , followed the Kilgour – Matas report ; Gutmann estimating that between 450 @,@ 000 and 1 million Falun Gong members were detained at any given time , and estimated that tens of thousands may have been targeted for organ harvesting . 

 Upon release of the initial report on 6 July 2006 , Chinese officials declared that China abides by World Health Organization principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors . They denounced the report as smears " based on rumours and false allegations " , and said the Chinese government had already investigated the claims and found them without any merit . The report is banned in Russia and China . Among international concerns , the US National Kidney Foundation expressed that it was " deeply concerned " about the allegations . 

 In 2009 , the authors published an updated version of the report as a book , titled Bloody Harvest , The killing of Falun Gong for their organs , and in the same year received an award from the International Society for Human Rights . 


 = = Background = = 



 = = = Falun Gong = = = 


 Falun Gong is a spiritual discipline that combines meditation and exercises with a moral philosophy , emerged in China in the 1990s ; by 1999 the number of practitioners was estimated in the tens of millions . 

 In July 1999 , following a large @-@ scale demonstration to request official recognition , Chinese authorities initiated a nationwide campaign to suppress the group , and created the 610 Office to oversee and coordinate the elimination of Falun Gong . The suppression that followed was accompanied by what Amnesty International called a " massive propaganda campaign , " , as well as the detention and imprisonment of tens of thousands of Falun Gong adherents . Former detainees reported that in some labour camps , Falun Gong practitioners comprised the majority population , and were singled out for abuse . Under order from Beijing , practitioners are subject to coercive “ reeducation ” and torture , sometimes resulting in deaths . Due to limited access to victims and labour camp facilities , however , many specific reports of abuses are difficult to independently corroborate . 


 = = = Organ transplantation in China = = = 


 China has had an organ transplantation programme since the 1960s . It is one of the largest organ transplant programmes in the world , peaking at over 13 @,@ 000 transplants a year in 2004 . Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law , although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives . By the 1990s , growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice . These concerns resurfaced in 2001 , when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum @-@ seeking doctor that he had taken part in organ extraction operations . 

 By 2005 the World Medical Association had specifically demanded that China cease using prisoners as organ donors . In December of that year , China 's Deputy Health Minister acknowledged that the practice of removing organs from executed prisoners for transplant was widespread – as many as 95 % of all organ transplants in China derived from executions , and he promised steps to prevent abuse . 


 = = = Sujiatun = = = 


 The first allegations of systematic organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners were made in March 2006 by two individuals claiming to possess knowledge of involuntary organ extractions at the Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital in Shenyang , Liaoning province . The allegations were publicized by the Epoch Times , a newspaper group founded by Falun Gong practitioners . Within one month of the press coverage , third party investigators , including representatives of the US Department of State , said that there was insufficient evidence to prove the allegations . In 2006 and 2008 , United Nations Special Rapporteurs raised questions about the sources of organs , the short waiting times for finding perfectly matched organs , and the correlation between the sudden increase in organ transplants in China and the beginning of the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners .
