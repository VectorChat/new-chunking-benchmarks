 = = = Magic and special items = = = 


 Though Link must still collect several items in order to progress in the game ( as in the previous and subsequent installments of the series ) , these special items grant abilities which either remain in permanent use for the rest of the game or can only be activated in the overworld . In place of actively used items , The Adventure of Link features eight spells for Link to use during action scenes . Each spell is learned from a different wise man in one of the eight towns within Hyrule . Link often has to complete side @-@ quests , such as retrieving lost items , before they will teach him their spells . Some spells and items are necessary for advancing beyond certain points in the game . Also , the Life spell becomes the main means of recovering health during action scenes , since healing Fairies are only found in rare fixed spots , and only appear randomly as overworld encounters .

 Like its predecessor , The Adventure of Link allows storing up to three games in the cartridge 's memory . Once the game has been completed , selecting the corresponding file in the main menu allows starting a new game preserving the acquired experience levels , techniques and magic spells ( but no special items , Heart and Magic containers or extra lives , which must be obtained again ) . 


 = = Plot = = 


 Several years after the events of The Legend of Zelda , the now @-@ sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Link notices a strange mark on the back of his left hand , exactly like the crest of Hyrule . He seeks out Impa , who responds by taking Link to the North Castle , where a door has been magically sealed for generations . Impa places the back of Link 's left hand on the door , and it opens , revealing a sleeping maiden . Impa tells Link that the maiden is Zelda ( not the Zelda from the first game ) , the princess of Hyrule from long ago , and the origin of the " Legend of Zelda " . Zelda 's brother had tried to force her into telling their recently deceased father 's secrets concerning the last of three sacred golden triangle treasures of his kingdom , known collectively as the Triforce . Princess Zelda refused to reveal its location , and the prince 's wizard friend , in anger , tried to strike her down with a spell . Zelda fell under a powerful sleeping spell , but the wizard was unable to control the wildly arcing magic and was killed by it . The prince , filled with remorse and unable to reverse the spell , had his sister placed in the castle tower , in the hope that she would one day be awakened . He decreed that princesses born to the royal family from that point on would be named Zelda , in remembrance of this tragedy . 

 Impa says that the mark on Link 's hand means that he is the hero chosen to awaken Zelda . She gives Link a chest containing six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read . Link finds that he can read the document , even though he has never seen the language before ; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule . This will open the way to the Great Palace , which contains the Triforce of Courage . Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda . Taking the crystals , Link sets out to restore them to their palaces . Meanwhile , the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link ; sprinkling his blood on Ganon ’ s ashes will bring Ganon back to life . 

 Ultimately , Link restores the crystals to the six palaces , defeating a strong guardian within each one to do so , and enters the Great Palace . After venturing deep inside , Link must battle a flying creature known as Thunderbird , followed by a shadowy doppelgänger of himself known as Dark Link . Link then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda . The three triangles unite into the collective Triforce , and Link 's wish awakens Zelda . The game ends as they ( presumably ) kiss under a falling curtain . 


 = = Development and releases = = 


 Shigeru Miyamoto , the creator of the original The Legend of Zelda , intended to make Zelda II : The Adventure of Link fundamentally different from its predecessor . A different team was assembled to develop the game . However , Miyamoto ( who was credited under the pseudonym " Miyahon " ) was the producer , and Takashi Tezuka returned to write the story and script . Zelda II : The Adventure of Link was directed by Tadashi Sugiyama ( credited as " Sugiyan " ) , for whom it was the first project at Nintendo . The game 's music was composed by Akito Nakatsuka ( credited as " Tsukasan " ) . 

 The Adventure of Link was originally released on the Family Computer Disk System ( FDS ) before its worldwide release . Like its predecessor , the FDS version appears to be an earlier version of the game , with a few obvious differences . In the English release , the dungeons each have different colors , whereas in the FDS version they are all gray . Also , the two dungeon bosses Carrok and Volvagia ( the latter being initially named Barba in the NES release ) have different graphical appearances . The game over screen in the English version features the silhouette of Ganon from the chest up , with the text saying " Game Over / Return of Ganon " , whereas the FDS game over screen is a plain black screen with the text saying " Return of Ganon / The End " . There are some slight additions to the dungeons , as well as a handful of differences on the dungeons themselves . Due to an additional soundchip that the Disk System has , when Nintendo ported Zelda II over to the NES they had to eliminate some musical elements , especially from the title screen . On the main map , the icons denoting attacking monsters look different , but the most significant change is the spending of experience points , as Link 's three attributes cost the same , unlike the worldwide release . Further , the game is designed to promote balanced leveling , as the saved game on the disk will only let the levels for the attributes go as high as whatever is set the lowest ( e.g. if Life is at 5 and Strength is at 4 , but Magic is at 1 , then the saved game will reflect all as level 1 ) , while still saving the data regarding crystals that have been placed and items that have been collected . These differences make leveling up in the game very different . 

 The Adventure of Link was re @-@ released in 2003 on the The Legend of Zelda : Collector 's Edition disc for the GameCube , and again in 2004 as part of the “ Classic NES Series ” for Game Boy Advance , with changes . The intro text has been changed to read " third Triforce " rather than " No.3 Triforce " and the copyright date has been altered to read " 1987- 2004 " . The death animation removed flashing colors in an effort to prevent seizures , replacing it with a solid red color . There were also various graphical and audio tweaks . It was released as the 100th title on the Wii 's Virtual Console in Japan on January 23 , 2007 , in Europe and Australia on February 9 , 2007 and was released in North America on June 4 , 2007 . The text changes weren 't made in this version , but it does feature the solid red color in the death animations from the GameCube and Game Boy Advance versions . 

 The game was released yet again in September 2011 on Virtual Console ( this time on the 3DS ) , bundled with its predecessor as part of a free giveaway of 10 original Nintendo Entertainment System games to 3DS owners who purchased the console before the price drop . It is now available to purchase on the Nintendo eShop for the 3DS and Wii U. The 3DS version is a direct port of the original NES release and , consequently , features the flashing color death scene and none of the text alterations of previous re @-@ releases . Although the game features the save option , fully resetting the software currently results in the save game being deleted , meaning that the user should not do this unless that is the desired outcome .

 Upon its release in North America , Zelda II became one of the most popular NES games of 1988 , with many retailers reporting that the game was selling out that year . The game ultimately sold 4 @.@ 38 million copies worldwide , making it the fifth best selling NES game , behind the Super Mario Bros. series and the first Legend of Zelda game . 

 In 1987 , Famicom Tsūshin ( now Famitsu ) gave it a score of 36 out of 40 , based on a panel of four reviewers giving it ratings of 8 , 10 , 9 and 9 out of 10 . This made it their second highest @-@ rated game of 1987 , behind only Dragon Quest II . These were also the only two games to have received a Famitsu score of 35 / 40 or above up until 1987 . Play magazine praised the unique gameplay , saying that " it 's this combination of unique elements that creates an action @-@ RPG experience unlike any other " . Nintendo Power said that the game was " an entertaining and natural step in the franchise 's evolution , " and awarded it their Game of the Year Award for 1988 . Zelda II was reviewed in 1992 by issue # 2 of Total ! magazine , where it received an 82 % rating , due in great part to mediocre sub @-@ scores for music and graphics . A 1993 review of the game was printed in issue # 198 of Dragon by Sandy Petersen , in the " Eye of the Monitor " column . Petersen gave the game 3 out of 5 stars . 

 Zelda II was rated the 110th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power 's Top 200 Games list . In August 2008 , Nintendo Power listed it as the 12th best Nintendo Entertainment System video game , describing it as a radical and refreshing departure from its predecessor .

 IGN said that the game is a " recommended and playable adventure " but also said " don 't expect the same gameplay from the truly classic Zelda titles . " 1UP.com praised the game 's length , citing that " you can certainly find plenty here to keep you busy for some time . " The game also received some criticism . GameSpot said that while the game is " decent enough to make it worth the $ 5 price [ on the Wii 's Virtual Console ] " , it features " questionable design decision [ s ] " and can get confusing if players don 't have the help of walkthroughs . The GBA version of the game had an aggregated score of 73 on Metacritic. and an aggregated score of 68 @.@ 88 on GameRankings , making it the game of the series with the lowest score in both websites . 


 = = Legacy = = 


 Many elements first introduced in this game have remained in the series . For instance , non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) were present in The Legend of Zelda , but their role was rather limited . Starting with The Adventure of Link , Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link 's quests . Zelda II was also one of the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas , giving the world a life of its own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold . The use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games . The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of Link and plays an important role in later Zelda games , as it is strongly associated with Link . Dark Link is a version of Link 's Shadow which appears in Ocarina of Time , a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in Four Swords Adventures , and yet another appears in Spirit Tracks , as well as in A Link Between Worlds . 

 Additionally , The Adventure of Link was one of the first games to combine role @-@ playing video game and platforming elements to a considerable degree . Over the next few years , a number of Japanese @-@ made games appeared with a similar format ; major titles such as Cadash ( 1989 ) closely resemble The Adventure of Link , with side @-@ scrolling platform stages supplemented by RPG @-@ like statistical systems , weapons , armor , magic spells , and so forth . 

 Most of the sages in Ocarina of Time bear the same names as towns from The Adventure of Link ( Rauru , Ruto , Saria , Nabooru , and Darunia ; excluding Impa ) . Another town , Mido , is also the name of a character in Kokiri Forest . However , in the in @-@ game chronology , the towns were named after the characters . The Adventure of Link is also the only Zelda game of the main English releases not to use " The Legend of Zelda " in its title , the only Zelda game to feature " lives " counting down , and therefore the only game in the series to include 1 @-@ up dolls . The next Zelda game released after The Adventure of Link was The Legend of Zelda : A Link to the Past for the Super Famicom in 1991 , which follows new Link and Zelda characters and returns to the top @-@ down style of the original . It is officially considered a prequel to the NES games , and as of 2016 there has been no technical plot sequel to The Adventure of Link , with each Zelda game being either a prequel or a " sequel to a prequel " . 

 There are a small number of side scrolling areas in The Legend of Zelda : Link 's Awakening ; these areas were mainly underground tunnels and caves . The series broke away from the top @-@ down style again in 1998 when Ocarina of Time was released on the Nintendo 64 , with 3D graphics . A new version of the composition " Temple " , arranged by Shogo Sakai , is featured in Super Smash Bros. Melee , where it is played during the " Hyrule Temple " stage and the " Underground Maze " level . A variation of the track , as well as a new version of the ' Grand Palace ' level song , also appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl . The track was later once again updated and appeared twice , as the " Streetpass Battle Theme " as well as a slower version for the " Battle Victory " music , in the Nintendo 3DS Zelda game A Link Between Worlds , making it the only subsequent Zelda game to include theme music that originated in The Adventure of Link . The Streetpass battle mode is itself inspired by the final boss fight of Zelda 2 , and Streetpass fights occur between the player as Link , and the other player as Shadow / Dark Link . 

 The 3DS title Adventure Time : Hey Ice King ! Why 'd You Steal Our Garbage ? ! , developed by WayForward Technologies was intended to play like Zelda II and pays homage to it . It features very similar gameplay and references to The Legend of Zelda series of video games . 



 = Mido ( footballer ) = 


 Ahmed Hossam Hussein Abdelhamid ( Arabic : أحمد حسام حسين ; born 23 February 1983 ) , more commonly known as Mido , is an Egyptian football manager . He is currently the technical adviser of Lierse S.K .. He is also a TV presenter and former footballer who played as a striker . 

 Mido started his career with Zamalek in Egypt in 1999 . He left the club for Gent of Belgium in 2000 , where he won the Belgian Ebony Shoe . This led to a move to Dutch side Ajax in 2001 , from where he joined Celta Vigo on loan in 2003 . His next destination was Marseille in France and he left them for Italian side Roma in 2004 . He joined English side Tottenham Hotspur on an 18 @-@ month loan in 2005 and eventually joined the club permanently in 2006 . He left the club in 2007 to join Middlesbrough , from whom he joined Wigan Athletic , Zamalek , West Ham United and Ajax on loan . In 2011 , he rejoined Zamalek , before joining Barnsley in 2012 . He also played for Egypt 51 times scoring 20 goals . Mido retired from football in June 2013 .

 = = = Zamalek = = = 


 Born in Cairo , Mido started his career with Egyptian Premier League club Zamalek in 1999 . He made his league debut on 22 May 2000 in a 0 – 0 draw against El Qanah . The next week , Mido scored his first two goals against Aluminium Nag Hammâdi , which Zamalek won 3 – 2 . His African debut came on 28 May 2000 , in a 2 – 1 win against Ethiopian Coffee , making the aggregate score 3 – 3 , which led to the game being decided on penalties . Zamalek won 4 – 2 . Zamalek eventually reached the 2000 African Cup Winners ' Cup final , beating Cameroonian side Canon Yaoundé 4 – 3 on aggregate . Mido 's performances eventually attracted interest from Belgian club Gent . 


 = = = Gent = = = 


 In 2000 , at the age of 17 , Mido signed for Gent . Initially , he suffered from homesickness , and returned to Egypt shortly after arriving in Belgium , only staying at his father 's vehement insistence . Working hard to fight his reservations , Mido eventually overcame them , in his own words gaining " the mentality of a pro " . Gent manager Patrick Remy was impressed by Mido 's handling of the issue and promoted him to the first team in September 2000 , placing him at first on the substitutes ' bench . However , Mido continued to impress Remy , who commented on his " responsibilities ... [ and ] great technical capabilities " . He eventually became a first @-@ team regular , and made his league debut on 27 August 2000 in a 4 – 1 away win against Eendracht Aalst . On 2 October 2000 , he scored his first goal in a 2 – 1 home win against Standard Liège . His European debut came on 12 September 2000 , where Gent suffered a 6 – 0 home defeat to Ajax . He became a fan favourite , and was praised by the Belgian press at the end of the season . Mido went on to win the Belgian Ebony Shoe in 2001 as the best African player in the Belgian First Division , as well as being named the Belgian " Discovery of the Year " . As he attracted interest from major clubs both in Belgium and abroad , he ended the season with a powerful performance against Royal Antwerp , scoring one of Gent 's goals in a 3 – 1 win and setting up the other two . Two years later , Remy described the match to an Egyptian journalist , saying that " Mido did everything . " He finished the season with 11 goals from 21 matches , as Gent finished fifth , earning them a spot in the following season of the UEFA Intertoto Cup . 


 = = = Ajax = = = 


 After his success in Belgium with Gent , Mido signed a five @-@ year contract with Eredivisie team Ajax in 2001 . He suffered a concussion during their UEFA Cup match with Limassol , after colliding with a defender . He made his return for the team against Heerenveen , a match which Ajax lost 5 – 1 . However , he was sent off against Twente , after kicking Spira Grujić whilst trying to beat him to the ball , for which he was later given a three @-@ match ban . He returned for Ajax against Vitesse , coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute . He failed to be selected for the substitutes bench against Feyenoord in March 2002 , which was due to a minor clash with manager Ronald Koeman , and Mido left for a short vacation in Cairo . Mido scored in Ajax 's victory over Utrecht in the KNVB Cup final , meaning he ended the 2001 – 02 season with the Dutch League and Cup double . 

 He played for only 32 minutes against Groningen , after a display which lacked creativity . He said afterwards he was tired and was carrying a slight injury during the match , but Koeman criticised Mido saying he was not giving everything . He revealed in September 2002 that he wanted to leave Ajax in the transfer window in late December . However , Mido soon apologised to Koeman and Leo Beenhakker regarding the transfer comments , saying he was " irresponsible " and " unthoughtful " . He was handed a fine and suspended from Ajax 's game against Olympique Lyonnais . In December of that year , he revealed that he wanted to stay at Ajax . He scored for Ajax during their 6 – 0 defeat of Willem II in February 2003 , but Koeman again criticised Mido , commenting negatively on his performance against Roda in the KNVB Cup . He was dropped for Ajax 's next game against Feyenoord , only featuring as an unused substitute . He suffered a muscle strain in his upper thigh after a friendly for Egypt , and was ruled out of Ajax 's game against Groningen . Mido was relegated to the Ajax reserve team for disciplinary reasons , surrounding a perceived lack of effort in training . His situation at the club led to interest from Serie A clubs Juventus and Lazio and he was later reported to have thrown a pair of scissors at Ajax teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović following an argument in March 2003 . 


 = = = = Loan to Celta Vigo = = = = 


 Celta Vigo made a loan offer for Mido in March , which was reported to have fallen through days later as it was not approved by FIFA . However , FIFA eventually allowed the move to go through and it was completed on 18 March . He scored on his Celta Vigo debut against Athletic Bilbao , which Celta won 2 – 1 . Ajax valued Mido between the values of € 5 million and € 6 million , amidst interest from clubs in Italy and Spain . Newcastle United were reportedly on the verge of making a bid for Mido in May , but this was ruled out by Mido 's agent Christophe Henrotay . Ajax attempted to make him return to the club , but he declined this , in favour of staying at Celta . He suffered a muscle injury whilst training in May , but was available to play in Celta 's match against Villarreal CF , which saw Mido sent off in a game which Celta lost 5 – 0 . Mido was linked with a move to A.S. Roma in late May , with Roma chairman Franco Sensi stating " I want Mido " , but Ajax revealed they wanted € 15 million for him . Ajax turned down a loan move from Real Betis for Mido in June . Marseille were then believed to have made an offer for the striker and Celta were not ready to meet Ajax 's asking price of € 15 million . 


 = = = Marseille = = = 


 Ajax accepted a € 12 million bid for Mido from Marseille in July , and completed the move on a five @-@ year contract on 12 July 2003 , which made Mido the most expensive Egyptian player ever . He made his debut for Marseille in 1 – 0 win over Guingamp on 1 August 2003 . Jean @-@ Pierre Papin gave praise to Mido , saying it was down to players like him that the French Ligue 1 was among the top European leagues . He scored against Real Madrid in a UEFA Champions League match in November , which Marseille lost 2 – 1 . 

 Mido stated in March 2004 that he may leave Marseille at the end of the 2003 – 04 season . An English club and several Spanish clubs were believed to be interested in signing Mido , who had been overshadowed at Marseille by Didier Drogba . Atlético Madrid , Zaragoza , Osasuna and former club Celta Vigo were all rumoured to be interested in signing Mido , with Atlético 's interest being confirmed by their Technical Director Toni Muñoz . Meanwhile , Mido was caught speeding on the way to Marseille 's game against AS Monaco , which resulted in a court hearing . Reports suggested Roma were ready to sign Mido for a fee of € 9 million even though Mido would be out injured for the rest of the French football season . Turkish side Beşiktaş revealed they wanted to sign him , and Mido said he was to have talks with Bobby Robson about a possible move to Newcastle United . 


 = = = Roma = = = 


 Mido eventually signed for Roma on the final day of the 2004 summer transfer window , for a fee of € 6 million , signing a five @-@ year contract . It was confirmed that he would miss the opening game of the season , and possibly the following two games . Mido was penciled in to make his Roma debut against Messina in September 2004 , a game in which he did actually play , but Roma lost 4 – 3 . Reports suggested that Mido could be sold to Valencia in a swap deal with Bernardo Corradi and was also linked with a move to Premier League side Manchester City . Southampton were believed to have had Mido on their shortlist of targets , but his agent Christophe Henrotay said Roma would not be willing to let Mido leave the club . It was even reported that he had been offered to Southampton on loan but his new agent , Mino Raiola , repeated the earlier claims that Roma wanted to keep Mido until , at least , the end of the season . He was linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur , with his agent confirming he wanted a move away from Roma . 


 = = = Tottenham Hotspur = = = 


 Mido was signed by Tottenham on an 18 @-@ month loan deal on 28 January 2005 . He scored two goals on his Tottenham debut against Portsmouth on 5 February 2005 . He scored 3 goals in 11 appearances during the 2004 – 05 season for Tottenham . Mido announced plans in July 2005 to launch his own football academy in Egypt , which had the aim of nurturing the country 's young talent . In January 2006 , he expressed that he did not wish to return to Roma at the end of the 2005 – 06 season , but rather sign permanently with Tottenham . Tottenham manager Martin Jol said that the club were confident of signing Mido on a permanent deal due to his good performances , but later admitted Tottenham may be defeated in keeping Mido , with other clubs interested in signing him . His permanent move was further put into doubt in April 2006 , after he suffered a new injury problem . He suffered abuse from a small section of the Southampton and West Ham United fans in 2005 . West Ham manager Alan Pardew apologised to Mido for the abuse by the fans . He finished the 2005 – 06 season with 11 goals in 27 games , meaning he was Tottenham 's second highest goalscorer . Tottenham confirmed in May 2006 that Mido would be returning to Roma . 

 However , Mido re @-@ joined Tottenham on 29 August on a permanent deal for a fee of € 6 @.@ 75 million . After returning to Tottenhm he commented on the team 's official website that he " always knew in his heart he would be coming back " and that he " couldn 't wait to pull on a Tottenham shirt , play at the Lane and score some more goals " . However , soon after this , Mido was accused of being " irresponsible and disrespectful " by his manager Martin Jol , following comments Mido had made about former Tottenham player Sol Campbell . After failing to score in his first five appearances as a permanent Tottenham player , he finally found the net against rivals West Ham with a match @-@ winning volley on 19 October 2006 , and followed that with two goals against League Two side Milton Keynes Dons in the League Cup . He had to contend with being fourth in line for one of the two striking spots , but insisted that this was a sign of the club 's strength , and something he was fully aware of before rejoining the club . However , he was linked with a move to Manchester City . Mido scored what looked to be his final goal for Tottenham on 31 January 2007 against Arsenal , but his potential move to Manchester City fell through half an hour before the close of the transfer window . He eventually admitted he made a mistake by joining Tottenham on a permanent deal . He ended the 2006 – 07 season with 23 appearances and 5 goals . 


 = = = Middlesbrough = = = 


 Tottenham agreed a £ 6 million fee with Birmingham City for Mido on 20 July 2007 . Birmingham manager Steve Bruce said the move was close to collapsing , as the deal reportedly faltered over the wages and the length of contract Mido was demanding . The deal eventually fell through over a clause that Mido insisted be in the contract . In August 2007 Sunderland made a £ 6 million bid for him and held talks , after which Birmingham confirmed they were trying to revive their deal to sign Mido . Middlesbrough then revealed their interest in signing him , matching the £ 6 million fee of Birmingham and Sunderland and were given permission to speak to him . They eventually signed Mido for a fee of £ 6 million on a four @-@ year contract on 16 August 2007 . He scored on his debut for Middlesbrough against Fulham and on his home debut against Newcastle United . During the Newcastle game , Mido was reportedly subject to Islamophobic abuse from some Newcastle supporters , which The Football Association ( The FA ) was to investigate . 

 He suffered a stress fracture to the pubic bone which kept him out for more than three months from November 2007 until he returned to first @-@ team action for Middlesbrough 's 2 – 0 FA Cup victory over Mansfield Town on 26 January 2008 . He was sent off in the 80th minute in a match against Arsenal on 15 March 2008 after kicking Gaël Clichy in the face with his boot , which resulted in him receiving a three @-@ match ban . Mido was ruled out for the remainder of the 2007 – 08 season in April following a hernia operation on a pelvic injury . He made the bench for Middlesbrough 's opening Premier League fixture against former club Tottenham and came on as a substitute in the 82nd minute and scored four minutes later after deflecting Didier Digard 's shot . The following weekend saw him score against Liverpool at Anfield to put Middlesbrough 1 – 0 in the lead , but they eventually lost the game 2 – 1 . This was followed up with goals against Yeovil Town in the League Cup and Portsmouth in the league . Mido was again targeted by some Newcastle fans while warming up before Middlesbrough 's 0 – 0 draw , with claims of racist chanting being investigated by The FA . He revealed his anger at The FA 's investigation , believing that they would make no difference to any future abuse . Two men were eventually arrested over the chanting and were due to appear at Teesside Magistrates Court . 


 = = = = Loan to Wigan Athletic = = = = 


 Mido entered talks with Wigan Athletic over signing on a six @-@ month loan deal , and he completed the move on 23 January 2009 . He scored on his debut with the equalizing goal against Liverpool with a penalty kick in a 1 – 1 draw on 28 January . He scored for Wigan in a 4 – 1 defeat against Arsenal and he finished the loan spell with 12 appearances and 2 goals . Following Middlesbrough 's relegation to the Championship , he failed to report to pre @-@ season training , and he was eventually fined by the club after not turning up after a fortnight . He returned to training a day after this . 


 = = = = Loan to Zamalek = = = = 


 Middlesbrough accepted an undisclosed offer for Mido from an unnamed club on 26 July , and he completed a season @-@ long move to former club Zamalek on 3 August , who had an option to sign him permanently if they were able to meet Middlesbrough 's terms . On 20 August , Mido made a disappointing debut for Zamalek , wasting a second @-@ half penalty as Zamalek threw away their lead to suffer a late 2 – 1 home victory to Petrojet in the Egyptian Premier League . 


 = = = = Loan to West Ham United = = = = 


 Mido joined West Ham United on a four @-@ month loan on 1 February 2010 after his season @-@ long loan spell with Zamalek was terminated by mutual agreement . He stated " I had to sacrifice some things but I 'm here to play football again and I 'm here to prove a point . I 'm very happy to be here , it 's a great club – and I 'm sure I 'll do well here . " West Ham chairman David Sullivan announced that in order for Mido to secure his long @-@ term footballing future , his contract with West Ham put him amongst the lowest earners in the Premier League . Sullivan said " He doesn 't want to be known as a ' has been ' of English football , so he was willing to come here to play for a nominal fee , just £ 1 @,@ 000 a week . " He made his debut for West Ham on 6 February in 2 – 1 away defeat against Burnley . In nine appearances for West Ham he failed to score and had a tame penalty saved in a 2 – 2 away draw against Everton . In June 2010 , West Ham decided not to offer him a new contract .

 He has earned 51 caps for Egypt and scored 20 goals . Mido scored on his international debut against the United Arab Emirates , which Egypt won 2 – 1 . Mido sent a fax to the Egypt team to tell them he was not available for international selection in May 2004 , saying he was not psychologically fit to join the team . Mido was a part of the Egypt squad that played at the 2004 African Cup of Nations . 

 Egypt manager Marco Tardelli dropped Mido in September 2004 , after Mido claimed to be unavailable for the national team due to an injury , but played in a friendly match for Roma 24 hours later . A day later , Mido rejected accusations that he refused to play for his country . Also , the Egyptian Football Association announced that he would not play for the team again . However , Tardelli was sacked as Egypt coach and in January 2005 the Egyptian Football Association said they would consider bringing Mido back into the team if he were to apologise for his past behaviour . Mido flew to Cairo in February 2005 and made a public apology and the following month he was recalled by the national team . Mido withdrew from Egypt 's 2006 World Cup qualifier against Cameroon , after sustaining a muscle tear while playing with Tottenham Hotspur . 

 Mido was thrown out of the Egypt team during the 2006 African Cup of Nations as a consequence of an argument with coach Hassan Shehata in the semi @-@ final game against Senegal , which started after Mido reacted badly to being substituted . His replacement Amr Zaki came on to score a header with his first touch , putting Egypt into the final . A day later , Mido reconciled with Shehata , but was given a six @-@ month suspension from playing with Egypt . Mido was eventually recalled by the side following his suspension , ready for the 2008 African Cup of Nations qualification which Egypt won .

 Kingdom Hearts HD 1 @.@ 5 Remix ( キングダム ハーツ HD 1 @.@ 5 リミックス , Kingudamu Hātsu HD 1 @.@ 5 Rimikkusu , stylized Kingdom Hearts HD I.5 ReMIX ) is an HD remastered collection of the Kingdom Hearts series , developed by Square Enix for the PlayStation 3 . It was revealed in September 2012 and released in Japan in March 2013 , and North America , Australia and Europe in September 2013 . 

 Kingdom Hearts HD 1 @.@ 5 Remix includes both Kingdom Hearts Final Mix and Re : Chain of Memories in high @-@ definition and with trophy support . Additionally , the collection features Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days in a Theater Mode , spanning 2 hours and 50 minutes of HD remastered cinematics from the original game , as well as new scenes . The 358 / 2 Days cinematic also has trophy support . Ideas for a remastered collection of Kingdom Hearts games were first revealed in August 2011 , with the collection formally announced in September 2012 . Kingdom Hearts Final Mix , in addition to being created from the ground up due to lost assets from the original game , had the most adjustments made to its gameplay , including adding Reaction Commands first introduced in Kingdom Hearts II and allowing the camera to be moved with the right thumb stick . 

 The collection was met to generally favorable reviews . A second collection , Kingdom Hearts HD 2 @.@ 5 Remix , was released in 2014 while a third collection , Kingdom Hearts HD 2 @.@ 8 Final Chapter Prologue , will be released in 2016 .

 In the original and Final Mix versions of Kingdom Hearts , the command menu had four commands : Attack , Magic , Items , and a fourth context @-@ sensitive slot that varied depending on what the player had targeted , where they were , etc . The command menu has been updated to include " Attack " , " Magic " , " Items " , and " Summons " in the fourth slot , which was originally located as a sub @-@ category beneath the " Magic " menu . The original fourth command has been replaced by the introduction of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II and are triggered by pressing the Triangle Button . The camera works more similarly to that of Kingdom Hearts II , utilizing the right thumb stick to move the camera and allowing the player to click the R3 button to reset the camera behind Sora , as opposed to the original game which made use of the shoulder triggers L2 and R2 to position the camera . Overall , the gameplay of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was modified so it would play more similarly to Kingdom Hearts II and Re : Chain of Memories , to create a more consistent play style throughout the series . 

 It was released in North America , Europe and Australia for the first time as part of the collection .

 In August 2011 , Nomura expressed desire to release a high definition re @-@ release of the game though he had yet to confirm such plans . The idea for a high definition re @-@ release preceded plans for Final Fantasy X re @-@ release , and was a focus for two Square Enix programmers for over a year . 

 In September 2012 , Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts HD 1 @.@ 5 Remix for release in Japan on the PlayStation 3 . The collection would include both Kingdom Hearts Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Re : Chain of Memories in high definition and trophy support as well as non @-@ playable HD event scenes from Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days as a way for players to understand the story . The development team experimented with using some character models from Kingdom Hearts 3D : Dream Drop Distance for HD 1 @.@ 5 Remix . The cutscenes from Kingdom Hearts Final Mix , which were either unvoiced or used English voice acting , now use the original Japanese voice acting . Every cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days , whether it was originally a prerendered scene or used in @-@ game graphics , were remade for Theater Mode . 358 / 2 Days was originally planned to be an HD remade game , however , it would delay the development of the new title , so it ended up being within the compilation 's Theater Mode . 

 In January 2013 , Jesse McCartney , the voice of Roxas , posted a picture on Instagram of himself in a recording booth , with Roxas seen on a screen in the background , along with the caption , " For all you ' Kingdom Hearts ' Fans . Recording the next chapter ! # KingdomHearts # Roxas # Gamers . " The image was later deleted by McCartney . In February , Square Enix confirmed the game would release in North America and Europe , later revealing September 2013 releases for North America , Australia , and Europe . 

 It was revealed in March 2013 in a Famitsu interview , that 66 tracks spanning across all three games ( with a majority of them concentrated in Kingdom Hearts Final Mix ) were re @-@ recorded with live instrumentation , as opposed to the original games ' use of the PlayStation 2 's built @-@ in tone generator for their background music . In June 2013 , Nomura stated that the original game assets for Kingdom Hearts had been lost some time ago . He explained , " [ The game data ] was lost , so we had to research , and we had to dig out from the actual game what was available and recreate everything for HD . We had to recreate all the graphics and it was actually not that easy . "

Preorders for the game in North America , Australia , and Europe included a book of the game 's concept artwork and a dynamic PlayStation 3 theme .

 Kingdom Hearts HD 1 @.@ 5 Remix has been met to generally positive critical reception . Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the game a 77 / 100 . 

 Kotaku gave the release a generally positive rating , praising the redone visuals , tweaked gameplay and expanded content , but also noting the game 's age is still palpable . Game Informer gave the collection an 8 @.@ 25 out of 10 , stating " The core of this collection is the excellent original game , and that ’ s where your attention should be . The other two lowly offerings are inessential bonus features . " Joystiq gave a positive , unscored review , saying the collection " captures that early era of the franchise at its purest simplicity . It 's a trip down memory lane for long @-@ term fans , while the visual overhaul and back @-@ to @-@ beginnings story should make it a welcoming entry point for newcomers . " GameSpot gave the HD remake a 7 out of 10 , saying , " Kingdom Hearts HD 1 @.@ 5 Remix presents a couple of the earliest games in the beloved series in their best light and makes a revealing cinematic experience out of a third one . The three experiences complement one another with unique elements and welcome context that is a treat for longtime fans and newcomers alike . " 

 Giving the game a 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 , GameTrailers felt that , " While Kingdom Hearts HD 1 @.@ 5 ReMIX certainly lives up to the HD part of its name , the collection is not without its shortcomings . The original game ’ s inclusion with all the new revisions and the addition of Final Mix content is a worthy investment on its own , and the inclusion of Chain of Memories is a nice gesture . The card @-@ based battle system might be off @-@ putting , but it ’ s a unique experiment that deviates from the norm of the series . However , despite the overhauled visuals and new voice work , it ’ s hard to excuse the reduction of 358 / 2 Days to a lengthy film rather than an actual game . " IGN felt that the collection was " an excellent way to replay the series ’ first two games in crisp , high @-@ definition splendor " but was disappointed that the box art did not properly distinguish 358 / 2 Days as a non @-@ playable game . They awarded the collection an 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 . Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the collection an 8 out of 10 , stating the collection " brings a PS2 classic to the modern age with a noticeably impressive visual update , improved camera controls , and , for added fun , secondary and tertiary Kingdom Hearts content all contained on one disc .

 = Lovesick Blues = 


 " Lovesick Blues " is a show tune written by Cliff Friend and Irving Mills . The song first appeared in the 1922 musical Oh , Ernest . It was recorded by Emmett Miller in 1928 and later by country music singer Rex Griffin . The recordings by Griffin and Miller inspired Hank Williams to perform the song during his first appearances on the Louisiana Hayride in 1948 . Receiving an enthusiastic reception from the audience , Williams decided to record his own version despite initial push back from his producer Fred Rose and his band . 

 MGM Records released " Lovesick Blues " in February 1949 , and it became an overnight success , quickly reaching number one on Billboard 's Top C & W singles and number 24 on the Most Played in Jukeboxes list . The publication named it the top country and western record of the year , while Cashbox named it " Best Hillbilly Record of the Year " . 

 Several cover versions of the song have been recorded . The most popular , Frank Ifield 's 1962 version , topped the UK Singles Chart . In 2004 , Williams ' version was added to the National Recording Registry . 


 = = Background and recordings = = 


 " Lovesick Blues " was originally entitled " I 've Got the Lovesick Blues " and published by Jack Mills , Inc. in 1922 ; Irving Mills authored the lyrics and Cliff Friend composed the music . It was first performed by Anna Chandler in the Tin Pan Alley musical Oh ! Ernest and first recorded by Elsie Clark on March 21 , 1922 with Okeh Records . Following the recording , Cliff and Friend copyrighted the song on April 3 , 1922 . It was featured in a show at the Boardwalk Club in New York City in June 1922 and also recorded by Jack Shea on Vocalion Records later that summer . 

 On September 1 , 1925 , OKeh Records sent scout Ralph Peer and a recording crew to Asheville , North Carolina . Among the aspiring artists recorded by Peer was Emmett Miller . Accompanied by Walter Rothrock on the piano , Miller cut four sides for the label , including " Lovesick Blues " . The single was paired with " Big Bad Bill ( is Sweet William Now ) " and released in November 1925 . On June 12 , 1928 accompanied by the Georgia Crackers ( Tommy Dorsey , Jimmy Dorsey , Eddie Lang , and Leo McConville ) , Miller re @-@ recorded the song , which was subsequently released to weak sales . Miller 's version was covered by country music singer Rex Griffin in December 1939 on Decca Records . Griffin rearranged the song by using the original chorus - " I got a feeling called the blues " — as a verse and turning the verse " I 'm in love , I 'm in love , with a beautiful gal " into the new chorus . 


 = = Hank Williams recording = = 


 Hank Williams , who heard both the Miller and Griffin versions , started performing the song on the Louisiana Hayride shortly after joining in August 1948 . Horace Logan , the show 's producer and programming director for KWKH , reported that the audience " went crazy " the first time Williams performed the song on the show . In light of the live audience 's strong positive reaction , Williams decided to record the song . His decision was questioned by his musicians and also his producer , Fred Rose , who felt that the song did not merit a recording . Williams , mindful of the reaction he received live , persisted , and the recording took place during the final half @-@ hour of a session recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati , Ohio , on December 22 , 1948 . For this recording , Williams replaced the jazz musicians with a modern country music band , using a rhythm guitar , mandolin , string bass , drums and a steel guitar . Williams ' session band was composed of Clyde Baum ( mandolin ) , Zeke Turner ( electric guitar ) , Jerry Byrd ( steel guitar ) , Louis Innis ( rhythm guitar ) , Tommy Jackson ( fiddle ) and Willie Thawl ( bass ) . With little time left , Byrd and Turner replicated the musical arrangement they previously used on an Ernest Tubb session for a cover of Jimmie Rodgers ' " Waiting for a Train " . In the episode of American Masters about Williams , Drifting Cowboy Don Helms recalls , " When they recorded ' Lovesick Blues , ' Fred told Hank , ' That song 's out of meter ! Got too many bars in it . And you hold that note too long . ' And Hank said , ' Well , when I find a note I like , I wanna hold on to it as long as I can , ' you know , just tryin ' to be funny . And Fred said , ' Well , I 'll tell you what I 'm gonna do . That thing is so much out of meter , I 'm gonna get me a cup of coffee and when I get back maybe ya 'll have that thing cut . ' And they did , but it was still out of meter . So Fred lived with that the rest of his life . " Williams combined Griffin 's lyrical arrangement with a two @-@ beat honky @-@ tonk track , borrowing the yodeling and beat drops from Miller 's recording . " Lovesick Blues " was recorded in two takes . 

 MGM released " Lovesick Blues " on February 11 , 1949 , coupling it with " Never Again ( Will I Knock On Your Door ) " . The single sold 50 @,@ 000 copies in the first two weeks . On its February 26 , 1949 review , Billboard opined : " Hank 's razz @-@ mah @-@ tazz approach and ear @-@ catching yodeling should keep this side spinning " . Based on votes sent to Billboard , the record was rated with 85 points by disc jockeys , 82 by record dealers and 85 by jukebox operators . Between the three , the track scored an overall of 84 . In reference to its 100 @-@ point scale , Billboard regarded the record as " Excellent " . It reached number one on Billboard 's Top C & W singles , where it remained for sixteen weeks and reached number twenty @-@ four on Most Played in Jukeboxes . The magazine listed it as the " number one country and western record of 1949 " while Cashbox named it " Best Hillbilly record of the year " . In March 1949 , Wesley Rose requested Williams to send him the records by Griffin and Miller to prove that the song was in the public domain . Irving Mills , the original lyricist , sued Acuff @-@ Rose . The suit was settled on November 1 , 1949 and it was agreed that Mills and Acuff @-@ Rose would share the publishing of Williams ' recording . Mills retained the rest of rights to the song as he had also purchased Friend 's rights during the Great Depression . 

 Following the success of the song , Williams was invited to appear as a guest on the Grand Ole Opry , on June 11 , 1949 . After the performance , Williams received a standing ovation . " Lovesick Blues " became his signature song , which he used to close his shows . It was also his first number one hit , and garnered Williams the stage nickname of " The Lovesick Blues Boy " . In 1949 , the singer received second billing behind Eddy Arnold on the list of the " Year 's Top Selling Folk Artists " . Williams ' version of the song was featured in the films The Last Picture Show ( 1971 ) , Forrest Gump ( 1994 ) and The Shawshank Redemption ( 1994 ) . In 2004 , " Lovesick Blues " was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress . 


 = = The Crickets recording = = 


 The Crickets released their cover of the song ( based on Williams ' version ) in 1971 on the Philips label . The song appeared originally as the B @-@ side to the single " My Rockin ' Days " . The recording lineup consisted of Sonny Curtis providing lead guitar and vocals , Joe Osborn on bass , Jerry Allison on drums , and Glen Hardin on piano . The song was performed live on The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1972 . The song was later released on the album Bubblegum , Bop , Ballad And Boogies in 1973 .

Gramophone compared his singing to a " rough and raucous Jimmie Rodgers " . Meanwhile , Elizabethan delivered a negative review , stating : " No true country singer would dare do to a Hank Williams number what Frank Ifield has done to ' Lovesick Blues ' . " The review finished by declaring that Ifield had " none of Jim Reeves ' depth and character , nor of the subtle melodic quality ( of ) Don Gibson . " By the end of February 1963 , Billboard estimated that the single had sold close to a million copies worldwide .

 = Northern Isles = 


 The Northern Isles ( Scots : Northren Isles ; Scottish Gaelic : Na h @-@ Eileanan a Tuath ; Old Norse : Norðreyjar ) is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland . The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas . There are two main island groups : Shetland and Orkney . There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north , where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas . Both have a developing renewable energy industry . They also share a common Pictish and Norse history . Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 , and later the United Kingdom after 1801 . The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century . 

 Tourism is important to both archipelagos , with their distinctive prehistoric ruins playing a key part in their attraction , and there are regular ferry and air connections with mainland Scotland . The Scandinavian influence remains strong , especially in relation to local folklore , and both island chains have strong , although distinct , local cultures . The place names of the islands are dominated by their Norse heritage , although some may retain pre @-@ Celtic elements . 


 = = Geography = = 


 The phrase " Northern Isles " generally refers to the main islands of the Orkney and Shetland archipelagos . Stroma , which lies between mainland Scotland and Orkney , is part of Caithness , and so falls under Highland council area for local government purposes , not Orkney . It is , however , clearly one of the " northern isles " of Scotland . Fair Isle and Foula are outliers of Shetland , but would normally be considered as part of Shetland and thus the Northern Isles . Similarly , Sule Skerry and Sule Stack , although distant from the main group , are part of Orkney and technically amongst the Northern Isles . However , the other small islands that lie off the north coast of Scotland are in Highland and thus not usually considered to be part of the Northern Isles . 

 Orkney is situated 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) north of the coast of mainland Scotland , from which it is separated by the waters of the Pentland Firth . The largest island , known as the " Mainland " has an area of 523 @.@ 25 square kilometres ( 202 @.@ 03 sq mi ) , making it the sixth largest Scottish island . The total population in 2001 was 19 @,@ 245 and the largest town is Kirkwall . Shetland is around 170 kilometres ( 110 mi ) north of mainland Scotland , covers an area of 1 @,@ 468 square kilometres ( 567 sq mi ) and has a coastline 2 @,@ 702 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 679 mi ) long . Lerwick , the capital and largest settlement , has a population of around 7 @,@ 500 and about half of the archipelago 's total population of 22 @,@ 000 people live within 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) of the town . Orkney has 20 inhabited islands and Shetland a total of 16 . 


 = = Geology = = 


 The superficial rock of Orkney is almost entirely Old Red Sandstone , mostly of Middle Devonian age . As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness , this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series , as may be seen on the Orkney Mainland , where a narrow strip of the older rock is exposed between Stromness and Inganess , and again on the small island of Graemsay . 

 Middle Devonian basaltic volcanic rocks are found on western Hoy , on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay . Correlation between the Hoy volcanics and the other two exposures has been proposed , but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain . Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney . Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands . Boulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas . 

 The geology of Shetland is quite different . It is extremely complex , with numerous faults and fold axes . These islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny and there are outcrops of Lewisian , Dalriadan and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland . There are also small Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions . The most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite , peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar , which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor . Much of Shetland 's economy depends on the oil @-@ bearing sediments in the surrounding seas . 

 Geological evidence shows that at around 6100 BC a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slides hit the Northern Isles , ( as well as much of the east coast of Scotland ) , and may have created a wave of up to 25 metres ( 82 ft ) high in the voes of Shetland where modern populations are highest . 


 = = Climate = = 


 The Northern Isles have a cool , temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude , due to the influence of the surrounding seas and the Gulf Stream . In Shetland average peak temperatures are 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) in February and 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) in August and temperatures over 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) are rare . The frost @-@ free period may be as little as 3 months . 

 The average annual rainfall is 982 millimetres ( 38 @.@ 7 in ) in Orkney and 1 @,@ 168 millimetres ( 46 @.@ 0 in ) in Shetland . Winds are a key feature of the climate and even in summer there are almost constant breezes . In winter , there are frequent strong winds , with an average of 52 hours of gales being recorded annually in Orkney . Burradale wind farm on Shetland , which operates with five Vestas V47 660 kW turbines , achieved a world record of 57 @.@ 9 % capacity over the course of 2005 due to the persistent strong winds . 

 Snowfall is usually confined to the period November to February and seldom lies on the ground for more than a day . Less rain falls from April to August although no month receives less than an average of 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) . Annual bright sunshine averages 1082 hours in Shetland and overcast days are common . 

 To tourists , one of the fascinations of the islands is their " nightless " summers . On the longest day in Shetland there are over 19 hours of daylight and complete darkness is unknown . This long twilight is known in the Northern Isles as the " simmer dim " . Winter nights are correspondingly long with less than six hours of daylight at midwinter . At this time of year the aurora borealis can occasionally be seen on the northern horizon during moderate auroral activity . 


 = = Prehistory = = 


 There are numerous important prehistoric remains in Orkney , especially from the Neolithic period , four of which form the Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site that was inscribed in 1999 : Skara Brae ; Maes Howe ; the Stones of Stenness ; and Ring of Brodgar . The Knap of Howar Neolithic farmstead situated on the island of Papa Westray is probably the oldest preserved house in northern Europe . This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but was evidently built on the site of an even older settlement . Shetland is also extremely rich in physical remains of the prehistoric eras and there are over 5 @,@ 000 archaeological sites all told . Funzie Girt is a remarkable Neolithic dividing wall that ran for 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) across the island of Fetlar , although the Iron Age has provided the most outstanding archaeology on Shetland . Numerous brochs were erected at that time of which the Broch of Mousa is the finest preserved example of these round towers . In 2011 the collective site , " The Crucible of Iron Age Shetland " including Broch of Mousa , Old Scatness and Jarlshof joined the UK 's " Tentative List " of World Heritage Sites . 


 = = History , culture and politics = = 



 = = = Pictish times = = = 


 The culture that built the brochs is unknown , but by the late Iron Age the Northern Isles were part of the Pictish kingdom . The main archaeological relics from these times are symbol stones . One of the best examples is located on the Brough of Birsay ; it shows three warriors with spears and sword scabbards combined with traditional Pictish symbols . The St Ninian 's Isle Treasure was discovered in 1958 . The silver bowls , jewellery and other pieces are believed to date from approximately 800 AD . O 'Dell ( 1959 ) stated that " the treasure is the best survival of Scottish silver metalwork from the period " and that " the brooches show a variety of typical Pictish forms , with both animal @-@ head and lobed geometrical forms of terminal " . 

 Christianity probably arrived in Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority emerged in the 8th century . The Buckquoy spindle @-@ whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Ogham – inscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now generally considered to be of Irish Christian origin . 


 = = = Norse era = = = 


 The 8th century was also the time the Viking invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the Northern Isles , the fate of the existing indigenous population being uncertain . According to the Orkneyinga Saga , Vikings then made the islands the headquarters of pirate expeditions carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland . In response , Norwegian king Harald Hårfagre ( " Harald Fair Hair " ) annexed the Northern Isles in 875 and Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland . ( Some scholars believe that this story is apocryphal and based on the later voyages of Magnus Barelegs . ) 

 The islands were fully Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway . The King summoned the jarl Sigurd the Stout and said , " I order you and all your subjects to be baptised . If you refuse , I 'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel . " Unsurprisingly , Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke , receiving their own bishop in the early 11th century . 


 = = = Norwegian rule to Scots rule = = = 


 In the 14th century Orkney and Shetland remained a Norwegian province , but Scottish influence was growing . Jon Haraldsson , who was murdered in Thurso in 1231 , was the last of an unbroken line of Norse jarls , and thereafter the earls were Scots noblemen of the houses of Angus and St. Clair . In 1468 Shetland was pledged by Christian I , in his capacity as King of Norway , as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret , betrothed to James III of Scotland . As the money was never paid , the connection with the crown of Scotland became permanent . In 1470 William Sinclair , 1st Earl of Caithness ceded his title to James III and the following year the Northern Isles were directly annexed to Scotland . 


 = = = Early British era = = = 


 From the early 15th century on the Shetlanders had sold their goods through the Hanseatic League of German merchantmen . This trade with the North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union when high salt duties prohibited the German merchants from trading with Shetland . Shetland then went into an economic depression as the Scottish and local traders were not as skilled in trading with salted fish . However , some local merchant @-@ lairds took up where the German merchants had left off , and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent . For the independent farmer / fishermen of Shetland this had negative consequences , as they now had to fish for these merchant @-@ lairds . 

 British rule came at a price for many ordinary people as well as traders . The Shetlanders ' nautical skills were sought by the Royal Navy : some 3 @,@ 000 served during the Napoleonic Wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife . During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone and only 20 of them returned home . By the late 19th century 90 % of all Shetland was owned by just 32 people , and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8 @,@ 000 Shetlanders emigrated . With the passing of the Crofters ' Act in 1886 the Liberal prime minister William Gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords . The Act enabled those who had effectively been landowners ' serfs to become owner @-@ occupiers of their own small farms . 

 The Orcadian experience was somewhat different . An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers , fishermen and merchants that called themselves comunitatis Orcadie and who proved themselves increasing able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords . In the 17th century , Orcadians formed the overwhelming majority of employees of the Hudson 's Bay Company in Canada . The harsh climate of Orkney and the Orcadian reputation for sobriety and their boat @-@ handling skills made them ideal candidates for the rigours of the Canadian north . During this period , burning kelp briefly became a mainstay of the islands ' economy . For example , on Shapinsay over 3 @,@ 048 tonnes ( 3 @,@ 000 long tons ) of burned seaweed were produced per annum to make soda ash , bringing in £ 20 @,@ 000 to the local economy . Agricultural improvements beginning in the 17th century coincided with the enclosure of the commons and in the Victoria era the emergence of large and well @-@ managed farms using a five @-@ shift rotation system and producing high quality beef cattle . There is little evidence of an Orcadian fishing fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and then later Stromness becoming leading centres of development . Many Orcadian seamen became involved in whaling in Arctic waters during the 19th century , although the boats were generally based elsewhere in Britain . 


 = = = World Wars = = = 


 Orkney was the site of a navy base at Scapa Flow , which played a major role in World War I. After the Armistice in 1918 , the German High Seas Fleet was transferred in its entirety to Scapa Flow while a decision was to be made on its future ; however , the German sailors opened their sea @-@ cocks and scuttled all the ships . During World War I the 10th Cruiser Squadron was stationed at Swarbacks Minn in Shetland and during a single year from March 1917 more than 4 @,@ 500 ships sailed from Lerwick as part of an escorted convoy system . In total , Shetland lost more than 500 men , a higher proportion than any other part of Britain , and there were waves of emigration in the 1920s and 1930s . 

 One month into World War II , the Royal Navy battleship HMS Royal Oak was sunk by a German U @-@ boat in Scapa Flow . As a result barriers were built to close most of the access channels ; these had the additional advantage of creating causeways enabling travellers to go from island to island by road instead of being obliged to rely on ferries . The causeways were constructed by Italian prisoners of war , who also constructed the ornate Italian Chapel . The Scapa Flow base was run down after the war , eventually closing in 1957 . 

 During World War II a Norwegian naval unit nicknamed the " Shetland Bus " was established by the Special Operations Executive in the autumn of 1940 with a base first at Lunna and later in Scalloway to conduct operations around the coast of Norway . About 30 fishing vessels used by Norwegian refugees were gathered and the Shetland Bus conducted covert operations , carrying intelligence agents , refugees , instructors for the resistance , and military supplies . It made over 200 trips across the sea with Leif Larsen , the most highly decorated allied naval officer of the war , making 52 of them . 

 The problem of a declining population was significant in the post @-@ war years , although in the last decades of the 20th century there was a recovery and life in the islands focused on growing prosperity and the emergence of a relatively classless society . 


 = = Modern times = = 



 = = = Politics = = = 


 Due to their history , the islands have a Norse , rather than a Gaelic flavour , and have historic links with the Faroes , Iceland , and Norway . The similarities of both geography and history are matched by some elements of the current political process . Both Orkney and Shetland are represented in the House of Commons as constituting the Orkney and Shetland constituency , which elects one Member of Parliament ( MP ) , the current incumbent being Alistair Carmichael . Both are also within the Highlands and Islands electoral region for the Scottish Parliament . 

 However there are also two separate constituencies that elect one Member of the Scottish Parliament each for Orkney and Shetland by the first past the post system . Orkney and Shetland also have separate local Councils which are dominated by independents , that is they are not members of a political party . 

 The Orkney Movement , a political party that supported devolution for Orkney from the rest of Scotland , contested the 1987 general election as the Orkney and Shetland Movement ( a coalition of the Orkney movement and its equivalent for Shetland ) . Their candidate , John Goodlad , came 4th with 3 @,@ 095 votes , 14 @.@ 5 % of those cast , but the experiment has not been repeated . 


 = = = Transport = = = 


 Ferry services link Orkney and Shetland to the rest of Scotland , the main routes being Scrabster harbour , Thurso to Stromness and Aberdeen to Lerwick , both operated by Serco NorthLink Ferries . Inter @-@ island ferry services are operated by Orkney Ferries and SIC Ferries , which are operated by the respective local authorities and Northlink also run a Lerwick to Kirkwall service . The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide , and there are numerous sites of wrecked ships . Lighthouses are sited as an aid to navigation at various locations . 

 The main airport in Orkney is at Kirkwall , operated by Highland and Islands Airports . Loganair , a franchise of Flybe , provides services to the Scottish mainland ( Aberdeen , Edinburgh , Glasgow and Inverness ) , as well as to Sumburgh Airport in Shetland . Similar services fly from Sumburgh to the Scottish mainland . 

 Inter @-@ Island flights are available from Kirkwall to several Orkney islands and from the Shetland Mainland to most of the inhabited islands including those from Tingwall Airport . There are frequent charter flights from Aberdeen to Scatsta near Sullom Voe , which are used to transport oilfield workers and this small terminal has the fifth largest number of international passengers in Scotland . The scheduled air service between Westray and Papa Westray is reputedly the shortest in the world at two minutes ' duration . 


 = = = Economics = = = 


 The very different geologies of the two archipelagos have resulted in dissimilar local economies . In Shetland , the main revenue producers in Shetland are agriculture , aquaculture , fishing , renewable energy , the petroleum industry ( offshore crude oil and natural gas production ) , the creative industries and tourism . Oil and gas was first landed at Sullom Voe in 1978 , and it has subsequently become one of the largest oil terminals in Europe . Taxes from the oil have increased public sector spending in Shetland on social welfare , art , sport , environmental measures and financial development . Three quarters of the islands ' work force is employed in the service sector and Shetland Islands Council alone accounted for 27 @.@ 9 % of output in 2003 . Fishing remains central to the islands ' economy today , with the total catch being 75 @,@ 767 tonnes ( 74 @,@ 570 long tons ; 83 @,@ 519 short tons ) in 2009 , valued at over £ 73 @.@ 2 million . 

 By contrast , fishing has declined in Orkney since the 19th century and the impact of the oil industry has been much less significant . However , the soil of Orkney is generally very fertile and most of the land is taken up by farms , agriculture being by far the most important sector of the economy and providing employment for a quarter of the workforce . More than 90 % of agricultural land is used for grazing for sheep and cattle , with cereal production utilising about 4 % ( 4 @,@ 200 hectares ( 10 @,@ 000 acres ) ) , although woodland occupies only 134 hectares ( 330 acres ) . 

 Orkney and Shetland have significant wind and marine energy resources , and renewable energy has recently come into prominence . The European Marine Energy Centre is a Scottish Government @-@ backed research facility that has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney Mainland and a tidal power testing station on the island of Eday . This has been described as " the first of its kind in the world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose @-@ built performance testing facility . " 


 = = = Culture = = = 


 The Northern Isles have a rich folklore . For example , there are many Orcadian tales concerning trows , a form of troll that draws on the islands ' Scandinavian connections . Local customs in the past included marriage ceremonies at the Odin Stone that forms part of the Stones of Stenness . The best known literary figures from modern Orkney are the poet Edwin Muir , the poet and novelist George Mackay Brown and the novelist Eric Linklater . 

 Shetland has a strong tradition of local music . The Forty Fiddlers was formed in the 1950s to promote the traditional fiddle style , which is a vibrant part of local culture today . Notable exponents of Shetland folk music include Aly Bain and the late Tom Anderson and Peerie Willie Johnson . Thomas Fraser was a country musician who never released a commercial recording during his life , but whose work has become popular more than 20 years after his untimely death in 1978 . 


 = = = Language = = = 


 The Norn language formerly spoken in the islands , a descendant of the Old Norse of the Vikings , became extinct in the 18th or 19th century . The local dialects of the Scots language , collectively known as Insular Scots , are highly distinctive and retain strong Norn influences . 


 = = Island names = = 


 The etymology of the island names is dominated by Norse influence . There follows a listing of the derivation of all the inhabited islands in the Northern Isles . 


 = = = Shetland = = = 


 The oldest version of the modern name Shetland is Hetlandensis recorded in 1190 becoming Hetland in 1431 after various intermediate transformations . This then became Hjaltland in the 16th century . As Shetlandic Norn was gradually replaced by Scots Hjaltland became Ȝetland . When use of the letter yogh was discontinued , it was often replaced by the similar @-@ looking letter z , hence Zetland , the mispronounced form used to describe the pre @-@ 1975 county council . However the earlier name is Innse Chat – the island of the cats ( or the cat tribe ) as referred to in early Irish literature and it is just possible that this forms part of the Norse name . The Cat tribe also occupied parts of the northern Scottish mainland – hence the name of Caithness via the Norse Katanes ( " headland of the cat " ) , and the Gaelic name for Sutherland , Cataibh , meaning " among the Cats " . 

 The location of " Thule " , first mentioned by Pytheas of Massilia when he visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC is not known for certain . When Tacitus mentioned it in AD 98 it is clear he was referring to Shetland . 


 = = = Orkney = = = 


 Pytheas described Great Britain as being triangular in shape , with a northern tip called Orcas . This may have referred to Dunnet Head , from which Orkney is visible . Writing in the 1st century AD , the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela called the Orkney islands Orcades , as did Tacitus in AD 98 " Orc " is usually interpreted as a Pictish tribal name meaning " young pig " or " young boar " . The old Irish Gaelic name for the islands was Insi Orc ( " island of the pigs " ) . The ogham script on the Buckquoy spindle @-@ whorl is also cited as evidence for the pre @-@ Norse existence of Old Irish in Orkney . The Pictish association with Orkney is leant weight by the Norse name for the Pentland Firth – Pettaland @-@ fjörðr i.e " Pictland Firth . 

 The Norse retained the earlier root but changed the meaning , providing the only definite example of an adaption of a pre @-@ Norse place name in the Northern Isles . The islands became Orkneyar meaning " seal islands " . An alternative name for Orkney is recorded in 1300 — Hrossey , meaning " horse isle " and this may also contain a Pictish element of ros meaning " moor " or " plain " . 

 Unlike most of the larger Orkney islands , the derivation of the name " Shapinsay " is not obvious . The final ' ay ' is from the Old Norse for island , but the first two syllables are more difficult to interpret . Haswell @-@ Smith ( 2004 ) suggests the root may be hjalpandis @-@ øy ( helpful island ) due to the presence of a good harbour , although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago . The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to Scalpandisay , which may suggest a derivation from " judge 's island " . Another suggestion is " Hyalpandi 's island " , although no one of that name is known to have been associated with Shapinsay . 


 = = = Uninhabited islands = = = 


 Stroma , from the Norse Straumøy means " current island " or " island in the tidal stream " , a reference to the strong currents in the Pentland Firth . The Norse often gave animal names to islands and these have been transferred into English in for example , the Calf of Flotta and Horse of Copinsay . Brother Isle is an anglicisation of the Norse breiðareøy meaning " broad beach island " . The Norse holmr , meaning " a small islet " has become " Holm " in English and there are numerous examples of this use including Corn Holm , Thieves Holm and Little Holm . " Muckle " meaning large or big is one of few Scots words in the island names of the Nordreyar and appears in Muckle Roe and Muckle Flugga in Shetland and Muckle Green Holm and Muckle Skerry in Orkney . Many small islets and skerries have Scots or Insular Scots names such as Da Skerries o da Rokness and Da Buddle Stane in Shetland , and Kirk Rocks in Orkney . 



 = Black Ice ( album ) = 


 Black Ice is an album by Australian hard rock band AC / DC . It was the band 's fourteenth internationally released studio album and the fifteenth in Australia . Released internationally on 17 October 2008 , it was produced by Brendan O 'Brien . It marked the band 's first original recordings since 2000 's Stiff Upper Lip , with the eight @-@ year gap being the longest between AC / DC 's successive studio albums . Black Ice has the longest running time of any AC / DC studio album . 

 The album 's development was delayed because bass guitarist Cliff Williams sustained an injury and the band changed labels from Elektra Records to Sony Music . The first composing sessions between guitarists / brothers Angus and Malcolm Young were in London in 2003 . Recording happened during March and April 2008 at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver , Canada . O 'Brien tried to recapture the rock sound of the band 's early work , as opposed to the blues orientation of Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip , with suggestions such as adding " soul crooning " to Brian Johnson 's singing . The songs were mostly recorded live in the studio ; engineer Mike Fraser used only sparse overdubs and effects to keep the tracks as close to the originals as possible . 

 Black Ice was released exclusively in physical formats , as the group did not sell its music digitally at the time . Walmart got exclusive rights to distribute the album in North America . Its release was promoted with an extensive marketing campaign , which included displays of AC / DC memorabilia . The four singles issued from the album were , " Rock ' N ' Roll Train " , " Big Jack " , " Anything Goes " , and " Money Made " . Black Ice peaked at number one in 29 countries , including Australia , Canada , the United Kingdom and the United States . It was the second best @-@ selling record of 2008 , behind Coldplay 's Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends and had shipped 6 million copies worldwide by December . Critical reviews were generally positive , praising the music and its resemblance to the classic AC / DC sound , although some critics found the work too long and inconsistent . The track " War Machine " won the Best Hard Rock Performance category at the Grammys . The album itself was nominated for many awards , including the Grammy , Brit , Juno and ARIA Music Awards ; and was supported by a world tour between 2008 and 2010 . 

 Black Ice is the final AC / DC studio album to feature founding rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young , who left the band in September 2014 after being diagnosed with dementia . 


 = = Production = = 


 Black Ice is AC / DC 's seventeenth studio album release in Australia and their fourteenth international release . The band took a break after finishing the Stiff Upper Lip World Tour in 2001 , and resumed performing in 2003 , with eight presentations that included AC / DC 's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and they opened three concerts for The Rolling Stones ' Licks Tour . During those two years , guitarists Angus Young and Malcolm Young wrote music separately , then met in a London studio to work on new songs . 

 The production of Black Ice was delayed for several reasons . AC / DC left their label Atlantic Records , signed a deal with Sony Music and changed labels within Sony from Epic Records to Columbia Records . Bass guitarist Cliff Williams suffered an injury to his hand in 2005 and was unable to play for 18 months . While Williams was recovering , the Young brothers perfected the songs they had written . Angus revealed that there was no pressure from Sony for the band to release a new album , as the label was releasing DVDs and remasters of the AC / DC catalogue , and thus the group " could afford to sit back and say we 'll do another album when we think we 've got all the goods . " In a 2004 interview , vocalist Brian Johnson said that Angus had written harder riffs than those on Stiff Upper Lip and that he would be writing song lyrics for the first time since the band 's 1988 album Blow Up Your Video , but his input would end up minimal , with all tracks on Black Ice credited to the Youngs . Johnson explained that the brothers had done most of the lyrical job , and his collaboration was that he " helped with melody and just filling in gaps that I thought needed filling in " . 

 While producer Robert John " Mutt " Lange expressed an interest in working again with AC / DC , his schedule did not allow this . When the Young brothers called Columbia Records ' president Steve Barnett to announce the making of a new album , Barnett recommended producer Brendan O 'Brien . Angus said the band had considered talking to O 'Brien since the 1990s , as " he seemed to us a very competent professional " and because he and the band would benefit from working with a producer they had not worked with before . 

 On 3 March 2008 , recording started at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver , where Stiff Upper Lip was recorded , and lasted for eight weeks . Engineer Mike Fraser , who has mixed all AC / DC albums since The Razors Edge , said they recorded in batches of three songs to " keep things interesting " and to avoid overextended sessions . According to Fraser , the band had not rehearsed the songs before entering the studio . Despite " a couple of tweaks in the writing , sparkling up the choruses a bit better " during the recording , the compositions were mostly complete . Still , the Young brothers had new ideas during production , including the song " Anything Goes " , which was written when the studio sessions were nearly finished . The songs were mostly recorded live in the studio ; the instruments and backing vocals were recorded in the live room and the vocals at both the control room and an overdubbing booth . The performances were first recorded with analogue equipment , as Fraser considers that tape conveys " the sound of rock & roll " , and then digitised for mixing and overdubs . Fraser tried to not alter the original recordings – " I used Pro @-@ Tools purely as a tape machine " – with no effects on the bass and rhythm guitar , sparse delay and reverb effects on the vocals and other instruments and overdubs were only used for the lead guitar and vocals . 

 The first title considered for the album was Runaway Train . Malcolm suggested using a photograph of a famous 1895 derailment for the cover , but reconsidered after he found that Mr. Big had used it for their album Lean into It . According to Angus , Runaway Train was rejected was because it had been used by many musicians , including Elton John , Tom Petty and Eric Clapton , and he " wanted something unique , new , different " . So he suggested Black Ice , which refers to gigs played during winter in Scotland . He said , " it rolled off the tongue " and it reminded him of " radio warnings up north of black ice . " Angus was inspired to write the eponymous song by a similar warning heard on his car radio during production . 


 = = Composition = = 


 With Black Ice , Brendan O 'Brien tried to recapture the rock sound of AC / DC 's early work on albums such as Highway to Hell and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap . He thought the two previous studio albums , Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip , were blues @-@ influenced . O 'Brien tried to focus on the choruses , which he felt were the best part of the AC / DC songs , and encouraged the band to emphasise the " hooky , melodic side " of its song @-@ writing , which Angus complimented , since he had " never been great with harmonies " . Mike Fraser said the band aimed " towards The Razors Edge era , a little bit more up @-@ tempo stuff . " O 'Brien made suggestions about the band 's performance , got Angus to play slide guitar on " Stormy May Day " , and told Johnson to swap some screaming for " soul crooning " as Johnson was a soul singer . Johnson was worried that the rest of the band would think this did not suit the band 's style of hard rock and roll , but the band was quite receptive . Because of the highly demanding singing style , Johnson only recorded his vocals for one hour a day . The rhythm section continues the basic structure from other AC / DC records ; Cliff Williams played bass lines of eighth notes , and Phil Rudd 's drumming was a consistent 4 / 4 time , mostly on his snare , kick drum and hi @-@ hat cymbal . Both musicians expressed contentment with their roles in the band ; Rudd said , " I 'm not repressing skills . Most drummers are scared to try this " , and Williams admitted he plays " the same thing in every song , for the most part " , but added " [ i ] n AC / DC 's music , the song is more important than any individual 's bit in it " . 

 Angus said that when composing with Malcolm they share ideas to make each track " work together " to form a complete album , and Johnson added " these songs belong together . It 's about five boys having a damn good time in a studio . " With 15 songs and a running time of over 55 minutes , Black Ice has the longest running time of any AC / DC studio record . Malcolm said that " about 60 or 70 song ideas " were developed , but Angus stated that most were discarded because they were not " representative of how we are " . Angus also said that the first attempt to sequence the album resulted in a track list comprising eleven songs , " but as the days went by each band member voted for a new track , and then another , and other one " so they decided to include all the recorded tracks . 

 Most of the album 's tracks are about rock and roll itself – Angus stated , " Certain songs just seem to come to life when you add that phrase " . However , other themes served as inspiration . " Money Made " is a criticism on how , according to Angus , in the US " everything is money these days " . " War Machine " was based on a documentary on Hannibal , which led to the conclusion that the military has not changed since Ancient Rome . " Wheels " tells about Johnson 's passion for motorcars . He described the album 's release as the " best one we 've done " , he felt that while Back in Black was great for its time , Black Ice shows the band 's versatility . Angus also said he admired the album 's diversity , saying " It is sufficiently varied to please people in varied moods " . 


 = = Release and promotion = = 


 On 18 August 2008 , Columbia Records announced that Black Ice would be released on 20 October in the US , and began accepting pre @-@ orders . " Rock ' n ' Roll Train " was issued as the first single from the album on 28 August ; " Big Jack " and " Anything Goes " followed in some markets , and " Money Made " was an airplay single in Australia and the United Kingdom . The track " Spoilin ' for a Fight " , was used by the WWE as the theme song for its 2008 Survivor Series event , and " War Machine " would later be included in both a trailer for 2010 's Iron Man 2 and the film 's soundtrack album in addition to serving as one of the theme songs for Wrestlemania XXV . 

 The CD version was also available in a hardcover , deluxe edition with a 30 @-@ page booklet containing exclusive new illustrations , studio and live photographs of the group and lyrics . A limited edition steel @-@ box version , containing the CD , a 20 @-@ page colour booklet , a DVD featuring the " Rock ' n ' Roll Train " video and a making of documentary , a large AC / DC flag , five stickers and a Gibson guitar pick , was issued in Germany and the United Kingdom in December . The album was released as a double LP on two 180 @-@ gram discs in a gatefold package featuring the standard red lettering artwork on the front . The LP was sold through the official website and through independent record shops in the US . An unknown number of copies of the vinyl version were incorrectly pressed ; side 1B had tracks from The Clash 's Live at Shea Stadium . Black Ice was not issued digitally as the band refused to sell their tracks separately . Angus declared , " If we were on iTunes , we know a certain percentage of people would only download two or three songs from the album – and we don 't think that represents us musically . " However , the entire album was leaked online a week before the official release . Rumours spread that Sony Music tried to control leaks by releasing fake tracks on peer @-@ to @-@ peer websites . 

 In North America , Walmart made a deal for the exclusive distribution of Black Ice , though a few independent music shops ordered copies of the album from foreign outlets . Angus declared that the band chose Walmart because the company is the biggest physical music retailer in America , which they believed to be " the best alternative to iTunes " . He also said , " There aren 't as many record stores these days , and Walmarts are all over America . New York and Los Angeles and Chicago may be covered , but in the heartland of America , Walmart may be the only gig in town . " Walmart created
