 = Józef Zajączek = 


 Prince Józef Zajączek ( 1 November 1752 , Kamieniec Podolski — 28 August 1826 , Warsaw ) was a Polish general and politician . 

 Zajączek started his career in the Army of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , an aide @-@ de @-@ camp to hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki . He was Branicki 's supporter on the political scene , before joining the liberal opposition during the Great Sejm in 1790 . He became a radical supporter of the Constitution of 3 May 1791 . As a military commander , in the rank of a general , he participated in Polish – Russian War of 1792 and Kościuszko Uprising . After the partitions of Poland , he joined the Napoleonic Army , and was a general in Napoleon 's forces until his wounding and capture during Napoleon 's invasion of Russia in 1812 . From 1815 he became involved in the governance of the Congress Kingdom of Poland , becoming the first Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland . 


 = = Youth = = 


 Józef Zajączek was born on 1 November 1752 in Kamieniec Podolski to Antoni Zajączek and Marianna Cieszkowska , members of the Polish noble family of the Świnka . Young Zajączek probably attended a school in Zamość , and later a Jesuit school in Warsaw . 

 At the age of sixteen he joined the Bar Confederates , and served as a secretary to Michał Wielhorski , accompanying him on his diplomatic mission to Paris , France , in 1770 . Zajączek stayed in Paris for several years , and in 1773 he met one of the major leaders of the Confederacy , Casimir Pulaski . Falling under Pulaski 's influence , he left Wielhorski 's service , and accompanied Pulaski on his diplomatic mission to the Ottoman Empire in 1774 , where he witnessed the Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Kozludzha on 20 June . Returning to France later that year he wrote a hagiographic biography of Pulaski in French . In 1775 he got an officer ( junior lieutenant ) position in the hussar regiment of the French Army , although after several weeks he abandoned this position to return to Poland . Thanks to the support from the magnate Sapieha family he received a post of an aide @-@ de @-@ camp to hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki . 

 Zajączek participated as a deputy from the Podole Voivodeship in the Sejm ( parliament of the Commonwealth ) session of 1784 , and was a vocal member of the hetman Branicki 's faction ( known as the Hetmans ' Party ) . In a similar vein he participated in the Sejm of 1786 , this time as a deputy from the Kiev Voivodeship . During that time he emerged as a vocal critic of king Stanisław August Poniatowski . In late 1786 he married Aleksandra Iaura , née de Pernet . Meanwhile , he kept being promoted in ranks , reaching that of colonel in 1787 . He was also not a deputy to the first half of the Four @-@ year Sejm ( 1788 – 1792 ) , and spent the first two years of its deliberations with his unit ( 2nd Front Guard Regiment , Polish : 2 regiment straży przedniej ) on the Ukrainian border ; in 1790 , however , he was elected as a deputy once again and joined his patron Branicki in Warsaw . Soon , however , he left Branicki 's camp , joining the faction of Hugo Kołłątaj , the Patriotic Party . Zajączek became involved in the works of a commission tasked with reforming the Polish military , and contributed to a new project on military exercises and officer training . He became one of the supporters of the new Constitution of 3 May 1791 , and members of the Friends of the Constitution society .

 Displeased with reforms in Poland that were threatening its influence there , Russia invaded Poland in May 1792 , starting the Polish – Russian War of 1792 . Two weeks before the war started , on May 4 Zajączek became the commander of the 3rd Front Guard Regiment ( 3 regiment straży przedniej ) . On May 26 he was given command over a reserve corps , and on 29 May he was promoted to the rank of major general . After gathering some troops near Lublin , he departed towards Dubno , which he reached on 7 June . He was one of the Polish commanders at the victorius battle of Zieleńce , for which he received the highest decoration of the Polish military , Virtuti Militari , becoming the fifth person to receive this award , instituted just that year . He took part in some minor skirmishes , but did not participate in any significant battle before Stanisław August Poniatowski surrendered to the enemy , joining the Targowica Confederation . The war ended without any decisive battles , with the Polish army still in the fighting condition , not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies . Angered at the king 's betrayal , Zajączek was one of the main proponents of the plan to kidnap the king ; the plan , however , never came to fruition . Like many other dissatisfied officers , including Prince Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko , Zajączek requested a discharge from the army ; his resignation was accepted on 18 August . 

 Shortly afterward Zajączek left the country , heading to Vienna . In August 1793 he moved to Leipzig , joining a number of other Polish emigres , namely Kościuszko and Kołlątaj , preparing for a new war . Soon he became one of the major planners of this approaching conflict , often tasked with delivering important messages to Poland , and collecting information there ; in particular he was active in Warsaw , and Kościuszko planned for him to become a commander of that region . Zajączek also went on missions to Dresden and Paris . During that time , he became known as a radical revolutionary , democrat and proponent of abolishing serfdom in Poland . In April he joined the " club of Polish Jacobins " . 

 Shortly after the Kościuszko Uprising began in March 1794 , Zajączek joined Kościuszko in Luborzyca on 2 April . Zajączek was given the command of the Lesser Poland Division , and on 4 April he took part in battle of Racławice , which concluded with a major Polish victory . On 6 April he was promoted to lieutenant general . Over the next few weeks Zajączek accompanied Kościuszko and his staff . On 8 June he was defeated at the battle of Chełm and retreated toward Lublin . He lost support among the troops , and faced a mutiny , eventually quelled by Kościuszko , on 10 June . In mid June Zajączek 's forces merged with those of Kościuszko . He commanded the forces in the inconclusive battle of Gołków on 9 – 10 July , and soon after he was one of the Polish commanders of the defense of Warsaw that lasted from mid July until early September . In the following few weeks Zajączek became one of the members of the Supreme National Council , and a president of its Criminal Court . He was a commander of the defense of Warsaw during the disastrous battle of Praga of 4 November . During the battle Zajączek was wounded and retreated from the battle even before the conflict was over . He has been criticised for his insufficient preparation for the defense of Warsaw against Russian invasion , and for poor leadership during the battle . Zajączek escaped to Polish Galicia where he was interned by Austrians . He was released one year later , moving to Paris . 


 = = = In Napoleon 's army = = = 


 In Paris , Zajączek quickly became involved with the active emigre groups there . Hoping to sway revolutionary France into supporting the Polish cause , many Poles , including him , volunteered to join the French Revolutionary Army , eventually leading to the creation of the Polish Legions in Italy led by Jan Henryk Dąbrowski , which became a part of Napoleon 's army . On 8 March 1797 Napoleon ordered that Zajączek should be recognized as an active brigade general of the French army . That year he published a brochure on his experiences of the 1794 war , Histoire de la révolution de Pologne en 1794 , in which he tried to justify his actions . Zajączek was , however , still unpopular among the Polish troops , many of whom blamed him for the fall of Praga ; due to frequent personal conflicts , Zajączek chose to remain with the French army , rather than joining the Legions themselves . Over the coming years , he took part in the French Revolutionary Wars . He took part in the 1798 Egyptian Expedition . There he also served as a governor of several provinces , first , from July that year , of the Monufia Governorate , later , from January 1799 , simultaneously of the Faiyum Governorate and Beni Suef Governorate . On 25 January 1800 he defeated Murad Bey at the Battle of Sédiman . In 1801 he was promoted to division general , and later took part in the failed defense of Alexandria . 

 In 1802 Zajączek became the commander of the French 2nd Division . In 1803 he received the Knight 's Cross of the Legion of Honour ; a year later , the Commander 's Cross . In 1805 during the War of the Third Coalition he was assigned to the French Army of the Rhine , where he worked at army 's High Command . Next year in September , during the War of the Fourth Coalition , he was assigned to command of the foreign ( mostly Polish ) North Legion ; in the following month he organized another similar unit , the Kalisz Legion . In 1808 those units were reorganized into parts of the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw , in which Zajączek became a general . During that time , dissatisfied with his transfer from the French army , and being made subject to Prince Józef Poniatowski whom he disliked , he refused to wear a Polish uniform and swear an oath to the Duchy , and was forced to do so only on direct orders of French marshal Louis @-@ Nicolas Davout . In 1809 he commanded several formations in the Polish – Austrian War , where he failed to distinguish himself , instead suffering the only significant defeat in this campaign at the battle of Jedlińsk on 11 June . He remained in the Army after the war , commanding the 2nd Division , and organizing the troops for the expected conflict with Russia . 

 During Napoleon 's Invasion of Russia in 1812 , Zajączek commanded the 16th Infantry Division of the V Corps in la Grande Armée . His division performed well at the battle of Smolensk in August where he was wounded , recuperating till October . He rejoined his unit in the time to take part in the battle of Tarutino . After Prince Poniatowski , commander of the V Corps , was wounded , from 1 November Zajączek took charge of that formation . He led it at the battle of Vyazma and battle of Krasnoi until a wound at Berezina claimed his leg , which was amputated by doctor Dominique Jean Larrey . While recuperating from the wound he was taken prisoner by the Imperial Russian Army in Wilno ( Vilnius ) . 

 Zajączek 's name is found on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . 


 = = Prince and namestnik = = 


 Zajączek was imprisoned in Poltava fortress until January 1814 , first to Białystok , then – in July – he was returned to Warsaw . There he was assigned to the post of a deputy president of a Military Commission , reorganizing the former Napoleonic Army of the Duchy of Warsaw into a new , Russian @-@ controlled Army of the Congress Poland . 

 Russian tsar Alexander I , also newly crowned King of Poland , gave Zajączek on 3 December 1815 the position of the first Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland ( tsar 's deputized ruler of the territory , a position similar to that of a viceroy ) . This nomination surprised many , including Zajączek himself , who is said to have at first refused this position , but in the end accepted it after Alexander phrased his request as a direct order . Zajączek 's years as a namestnik have garnered mixed reviews , both among his contemporaries , as well as among later historians . He was actively interested in economic development of Polish lands , and contributed to the industrialization and urbanization of the Kingdom 's lands ; he was also one of the founders of the University of Warsaw . He has been criticized , however , for being inexperienced for such a major civil leader position , too servile to the wishes of his patron , Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and he often disregarded the Constitution of the Congress Poland , which contributed to a slow but steady erosion of the country 's freedoms and autonomy . Deferential towards the Russian authorities , he readily let Duke Constantine and Alexander 's commissar , Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev , neither of whose positions were envisioned in the Constitution , become the de facto rulers of the Kingdom . In recognition of Zajączek 's services , Aleksander I bestowed upon him the title of ' Prince of Poland ' on 27 April 1818 . 

 In the spring of 1826 Zajączek fell ill , steadily becoming weaker . On 25 July that year he lost consciousness , and died in the morning of 28 July . He died in Warsaw 's palace called Pałac Namiestnikowski ( Regent 's Palace ) , nowadays a seat of the President of Poland . His funeral lasted from 2 to 5 August . He was buried at the Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus in Opatówek , where he had a manor on the lands received from Napoleon . His heart was placed in the Bernardine Church in Warsaw , and his insides were buried at the Powązki Cemetery , also in Warsaw . 

 Zajączek and his wife had no children ; Aleksandra outlived her husband by nineteen years .

 = Molwyn Joseph = 


 Molwyn Joseph is an Antiguan politician and Chairman of the Antigua Labour Party ( ALP ) . First entering politics in 1984 when he was made a Minister without Portfolio in the government of Vere Bird , Joseph became Minister of Finance seven years later , renegotiating the Antiguan national debt and introducing fiscal reforms . After a 1996 scandal in which it was discovered he had used his position to import a 1930s Rolls Royce for a friend , bypassing normal import duties and taxes , he was dismissed from the Bird administration , returning 14 months later to serve as Minister for Planning , Implementation and the Environment . Following the 1999 general election he became Minister of Heath and Social Improvement before being made Minister of Tourism and the Environment a few months later . As Minister , Joseph attempted to improve the perception of Antigua as a tourist destination and invest in the industry , spending 2 million US dollars increasing the number of hotel rooms on the island and providing money for both Air Jamaica and Air Luxor to provide flights to the island . 

 Outside of his ministerial duties , he also met with Jiang Zhenghua , Vice @-@ Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , having led the official Antiguan delegation to Beijing . Following a power struggle in 2003 , Joseph was given the Economic Development and Investment Promotion portfolio , to hold at the same time as his Tourism and the Environment position . Despite a scandal surrounding donations he had received from Texan businessman Robert Stafford , Joseph was selected to contest the seat of St Mary 's North in the 2004 Antiguan general election , in which the ALP lost power , being replaced in government by the United Progressive Party ( UPP ) led by Baldwin Spencer . Joseph himself lost his seat , but was elected Chairman of the ALP a year later , and regained the seat in 2009 with a majority of 21 . The same year , he was arrested for participating in an unauthorised May Day rally protesting the UPP administration ; after a lengthy trial , he and several other ALP members were convicted and fined . 


 = = Early career = = 


 Joseph entered Cabinet @-@ level politics on 19 April 1984 when , following the ALP 's general election victory , he was made a Minister without Portfolio . In 1991 he became Minister of Finance and Trade , and along with Financial Secretary Keith Hurst and Minister of Economic Development Rodney Williams negotiated the rescheduling of Antigua 's national debt with European creditors . The government 's 1992 budget , announced and drafted by Joseph , included no new taxes but did involve a cut to government spending , in response to what he claimed was reduced spending by tourists and smaller amounts of international aid in 1990 and 1991 . The 1993 budget contained similar provisions , ruling out the possibility of an income tax , as suggested by one of Antigua 's major trade unions . This was accompanied by a programme of fiscal reforms , including " expenditure control , improved revenue collection , external debt management , proper evaluation of projects , improved public sector efficiency , price controls on basic foods and commodities , tax reform and good governance " . 

 Within Parliament , Joseph campaigned for the Business Licensing Bill , a statute which aimed to impose licensing fees , ranging from 40 to 20 @,@ 000 East Caribbean dollars , on those seeking to start businesses in certain fields . The Bill attracted large amounts of controversy , with critics such as Hugh Marshall asserting that it violated the CARICOM Single Market and Economy agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , and would lead to Antiguan traders finding it difficult to expand into external markets . Although other ministers such as Williams spoke in support of the bill , it was later shelved indefinitely , with Joseph saying that he " [ found ] myself a lonely man " . 


 = = Dismissal = = 


 In 1996 , Joseph left his position as Finance Minister after it was discovered that he had helped a friend import a 1930s Rolls Royce , using his position to bypass the normal import duties and taxes . Although the government 's immediate reaction was to deny that this had happened , the Solicitor @-@ General issued a report in which he found that " the landing of the Rolls Royce car ... was in violation of customs and port procedures " , facilitated by Joseph 's intervention . With the growing pressure , Joseph resigned on 22 September , . Now on the backbenches , Joseph became " senior parliamentarian in charge of refugees " , and as such was the government 's chief spokesperson when the eruption of a volcano in Montserrat led to 3 @,@ 000 refugees fleeing the country and coming to Antigua and Barbuda . 


 = = Reappointment = = 


 Joseph 's position on the backbenches did not last long ; on 3 December 1997 , less than two years after his resignation , he was recalled to take up the Planning , Implementation and the Environment portfolio , with Bird saying that " his managerial skills are required at this juncture of our economic history when several projects require implementation to get off the ground quickly " . Following the 1999 general election , he was again appointed to the cabinet , this time as Minister of Heath and Social Improvement , with the Planning portfolio going to Steadroy Benjamin . A few months later he became Minister of Tourism and the Environment , with Bernard Percival taking over his Health portfolio . 

 As Minister , Joseph oversaw a " back @-@ to @-@ basics approach " to tourism , attempting to have the nation perceived as one known " for its cleanliness , tidiness , natural beauty and pristine environment " . As part of this , the Antiguan government invested 2 million US dollars in boosting the number of hotel rooms available , from 3 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 , and opened the Antigua Hotel Institute , seeking to train Antiguans in how to more efficiently and effectively work in the tourism industry . Joseph also oversaw the government buying a third of the Jolly Beach Resort in an attempt to save it from bankruptcy , establishing a management company to oversee the property . In February 2000 he led the government delegation in an official visit to Beijing , where they met with Jiang Zhenghua , Vice @-@ Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , to discuss " bilateral relations and the issues of common concern " . He also led the Antiguan delegation to the World Travel Market in 2001 . Following Joseph 's promise of government investiture in the route , Air Jamaica resumed flights to Antigua in 2002 , having ceased flying there six years earlier . This was followed by the announcement that Air Luxor would similarly begin offering flights to the islands . 

 After a financial scandal in early 2003 , the ALP backbencher Sherfield Bowen asked for a vote of no confidence in Bird 's government on 19 May , calling for him to step down and " accusing him of being involved corrupt practices and governing without accountability " . When Bowen was threatened with being thrown out of the Party , he claimed that several other MPs and government ministers were prepared to resign if he was dismissed , including Joseph . The dispute remained unresolved , with Bowen accusing the government of vesting too much power in Senator Asot Michael ; Bowen , Hilroy Humpheys , Bernard Percival and Longford Jeremy eventually all resigned from the ALP administration , with further suggestions that Joseph , as well as trade minister Gaston Brown , could also leave . Joseph eventually announced on 19 June , that he would resign if Michael was not immediately removed ; within a few hours , Michael 's resignation had been formally tendered . Soon afterwards , Joseph was given the Economic Development and Investment Promotion portfolio , to hold at the same time as his Tourism and the Environment position . 


 = = Later career = = 


 In late 2003 , it was discovered that Texan businessman Allen Stanford had given both Joseph and fellow minister Gaston Browne cheques worth 100 @,@ 000 East Caribbean dollars . While Browne denied suggestions that this had constituted bribery , claiming that the money had gone towards community projects , Leader of the Opposition Baldwin Spencer demanded that both ministers resign . Both ministers were part of a team negotiating with Stanford over a land exchange in St. John 's , and the news led to protesters picketing their offices . Prime Minister Lester Bird affirmed his support in both ministers , and despite a motion of censure brought by the opposition and more protests , Stanford publicly made a second set of donations to Joseph and Browne . 

 Antigua had a general election in 2004 , following the dissolution of Parliament in late February ; with the ALP running a full slate , Joseph was nominated for the St Mary 's North seat . The ALP were conclusively defeated by the United Progressive Party ( UPP ) and forced out of government , Joseph lost his seat to Bertrand Joseph . Now in opposition , the ALP held a leadership contest in 2005 , in which Joseph was elected Party Chairman , defeating Vere Bird , Jr . 164 votes to 108 . In 2007 , he was appointed by Bird to act as Shadow Minister for Tourism and Education . In the 2009 general election he again ran for St Mary 's North , defeating Bertrand Joseph by 21 votes ; despite this , the UPP retained power . Following an unauthorised ALP march on May Day in 2009 to protest against the UPP government , Joseph and six other senior ALP figures , including the former Prime Minister , were arrested and charged with public order offences . They pleaded not guilty , but were convicted and fined .

" Outrageous " was also scrapped as the theme song from Catwoman . A 45 second music video composed of the scenes that were shot was released in the 2004 DVD Greatest Hits : My Prerogative . The video begins with Snoop Dogg and a group of men playing basketball in an outdoors court , until Spears appears wearing blue baggy shorts . She starts to flirt with him , before jumping into his arms and licking his beard . In the next scene , she performs with her dancers on a street at night . 

 Spears has performed the song only once , on her 2004 The Onyx Hotel Tour . It was the last song of the fifth act of the show , titled " Security Cameras " . She performed " Breathe on Me " wearing pink lingerie while emulating different sexual practices with her dancers . After it ended , she put on a white trench coat while her dancers wore them in black and performed " Outrageous " . The act ended with a skit that segued into the finale performance of " ( I Got That ) Boom Boom " .

 = Business routes of Interstate 69 in Michigan = 


 There are currently four business routes of Interstate 69 ( I @-@ 69 ) in the US state of Michigan . Designated Business Loop Interstate 69 ( BL I @-@ 69 ) , they are all former routings of I @-@ 69 's predecessor highways , US Highway 27 ( US 27 ) , M @-@ 78 or M @-@ 21 , in whole or in part . The BL I @-@ 69 in Coldwater and the one in Charlotte were both parts of US 27 before the freeway bypassed those two cities in 1967 and the early 1970s , respectively . The BL I @-@ 69 through Lansing and East Lansing was previously part of M @-@ 78 and Temporary I @-@ 69 until it was redesignated in 1987 . Before 1984 , the loop in Port Huron was originally part of M @-@ 21 and was initially a business spur numbered Business Spur Interstate 69 ( BS I @-@ 69 ) . It was later redesignated when it was extended to run concurrently with that city 's BL I @-@ 94 which was originally part of I @-@ 94 's predecessor , US 25 . Each business loop follows streets through each city 's downtown areas and connects to I @-@ 69 on both ends , giving traffic a route through the downtown and back to the freeway . 


 = = Coldwater = = 


 Business Loop I @-@ 69 ( BL I @-@ 69 ) is a business loop formed from part of the old US 27 and part of US 12 near and through Coldwater . At the southern end , it begins at exit 10 on I @-@ 69 where Fenn Road crosses the freeway . The business loop follows the two @-@ lane Fenn Road west for about three @-@ quarters of a mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) , then curves north to merge with old US 27 ( Angola Road ) . The highway runs northward through farmland south of Coldwater , and after approximately two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , it enters the city limit at Garfield Road . Once in Coldwater , the business loop follows Clay Street through residential neighborhoods . After another half mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) , the highway reaches a fork where Clay Street continues due north and Division Street branches to the northeast ; BL I @-@ 69 follows the four @-@ lane Division Street for about another mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the main intersection in the city known locally as " the Four Corners . " This intersection is where old US 27 intersects US 12 ( Chicago Street ) . BL I @-@ 69 turns eastward along the four @-@ lane US 12 and continues from the Four Corners back to I @-@ 69 at exit 13 . 

 In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) signposted the highway system for the first time , and the future US 27 corridor through Coldwater was part of the original M @-@ 29 . On November 11 , 1926 , the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) , and the new US 27 replaced M @-@ 29 in the area . In September 1967 , the freeway bypassing Coldwater opened . At the same time , the old route through the city was redesignated as BL I @-@ 69 .

 Business Loop I @-@ 69 ( BL I @-@ 69 ) is a business loop that took over the Business US 27 ( Bus . US 27 ) route inside Charlotte . It is a surface street for the nearly five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of the loop . The trunkline starts just outside the city of Charlotte at exit 57 and follows Cochran Road The loop travels due north through rural areas south of town along a two @-@ lane road . North of a crossing of the Battle Creek River , Cochrane Road widens to include a center turn lane . About 2 3 ⁄ 4 miles ( 4 @.@ 4 km ) north of the starting point , BL I @-@ 69 begins a 3 ⁄ 4 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) concurrency with M @-@ 50 at Shepherd Street . North of Warren Avenue , BL I @-@ 69 / M @-@ 50 widens to four lanes , two in each direction . The concurrency ends at Lawrence Avenue ; M @-@ 50 continues north , and the business loop heads east on Lawrence Avenue for a few blocks . That intersection also marks the eastern terminus of M @-@ 79 . From that point , BL I @-@ 69 follows Lawrence Avenue and then veers northeast onto Lansing Street to complete its loop at exit 61 . 

 In 1919 , the MSHD signposted the highway system for the first time , and the future US 27 corridor through Charlotte was part of the original M @-@ 29 . On November 11 , 1926 , the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the AASHO and the new US 27 replaced M @-@ 29 through Coldwater . By the end of the next year , M @-@ 78 was extended from downtown Charlotte along US 27 to run northeasterly toward Lansing . The highway through downtown Charlotte was first designated Bus . US 27 after the 1961 completion of a non @-@ freeway bypass , a two @-@ lane , limited @-@ access highway east of the city . At that point I @-@ 69 only existed in the southern parts of Michigan . That freeway was not extended up to the city when the southernmost segment of I @-@ 69 was completed in 1967 . By 1971 , I @-@ 69 was completed to Charlotte and at the time US 27 was cosigned with I @-@ 69 , the bypass being incorporated into I @-@ 69 . For three years the business loop in Charlotte was not signed as BL I @-@ 69 , but it was so designated in 1974 and Bus . US 27 was decommissioned in and near Charlotte .

 Business Loop I @-@ 69 , or BL I @-@ 69 , is a business loop in the Lansing area . It is the longest business route in the state of Michigan at a length of over 14 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 23 @.@ 3 km ) . Beginning at exit 93 on I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 69 in Eaton County west of the city , the business loop runs concurrently with M @-@ 43 east along Saginaw Highway . The roadway has five total lanes , two in each direction separated by a center turn lane , as it travels through commercial areas in Delta Township and past the Lansing Mall . BL I @-@ 69 / M @-@ 43 continues east on Saginaw Highway and crosses into Ingham County at Waverly Road . From the county line eastward , the highway is known as Saginaw Street , and it passes through residential neighborhoods . Within the city of Lansing , BL I @-@ 69 utilizes a one @-@ way pair of three @-@ to @-@ four @-@ lane streets : Saginaw Street eastbound and Oakland Street westbound . One block separates the two directions of BL I @-@ 69 / M @-@ 43 until the intersection with Martin Luther King Jr . Boulevard near the St. Lawrence Campus of the Sparrow Hospital ; east of this intersection two blocks separate the two directions of the highway . The business loop crosses the Grand River in downtown Lansing near the campus of Lansing Community College north of the Michigan State Capitol . 

 On the eastern side of the river just north of Cooley Law School Stadium , BL I @-@ 69 / M @-@ 43 intersects the one @-@ way pair of Cedar and Larch streets that carries the two directions of BL I @-@ 96 . BL I @-@ 69 / M @-@ 43 continues through residential areas east of the other business loop . Near Marshall Park between Maryland Avenue and Marshall Street , Oakland Avenue ends and Grand River Avenue takes over for the westbound direction of BL I @-@ 69 / M @-@ 43 . Further east near the interchange with US 127 , Grand River Avenue and Saginaw Street cross each other . M @-@ 43 departs to the southeast via Grand River Avenue while BL I @-@ 69 turns northeasterly via the four @-@ lane Saginaw Street . East of this intersection , BL I @-@ 69 crosses into East Lansing and runs through residential areas on the north side of the city . The roadway turns due east at Abbot Road . At an intersection with Haslett Road , Saginaw Street widens into a four @-@ lane divided highway with a grassy median . Along this section , it resumes the Saginaw Highway name and turns northeasterly again , crossing into Meridian Township . The major intersections along Saginaw Highway have Michigan left turns as well . Before the business loop ends , it crosses into Clinton County . The eastern end of BL I @-@ 69 is located at exit 94 on I @-@ 69 in Bath Township . 

 In 1919 , the MSHD signposted the highway system for the first time , and the east – west highways through Lansing were part of the original M @-@ 29 through downtown and the original M @-@ 39 north of downtown . The north – south highway in Lansing was the original M @-@ 14 . On November 11 , 1926 , the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the AASHO , and the new US 27 replaced M @-@ 29 and M @-@ 14 in the area . By the end of the next year , M @-@ 78 was extended from Charlotte along US 27 to through downtown Lansing . M @-@ 78 separated from US 27 in downtown Lansing and continued northeasterly through the northern part of East Lansing . M @-@ 39 was replaced with an extended M @-@ 43 in 1938 . 

 As the freeways in the Lansing area were completed in the 1960s through the 1980s , the highways through downtown changed designations . The section of I @-@ 96 west of Lansing opened in December 1962 . In 1973 , M @-@ 78 was converted to a freeway near the Flint area , and from Olivet southwest of Lansing to the new freeway , the old highway was redesignated Temporary I @-@ 69 ( Temp . I @-@ 69 ) . Additional segments of I @-@ 69 north of Lansing were finished in 1984 and 1987 . I @-@ 69 was routed over I @-@ 96 and the new freeway north of Lansing , and the business loop was designated along M @-@ 43 and the former Temp . I @-@ 69 in 1987 after that second segment opened .

 City of Death is the second serial of the seventeenth season of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , which depicts the adventures of a time @-@ travelling humanoid alien known as the Doctor . It was produced by the BBC and first broadcast in four weekly parts between 29 September 1979 and 20 October 1979 on BBC1 . The serial was written by " David Agnew " – a pseudonym for David Fisher , Douglas Adams , and Graham Williams – and directed by Michael Hayes . 

 City of Death features the Fourth Doctor ( Tom Baker ) and his companion Romana ( Lalla Ward ) . Set mainly in Paris in 1979 , the plot concerns a scheme by an alien , Scaroth , to steal the Mona Lisa to finance experiments in time travel in the hope of averting the accident that marooned him on Earth four hundred million years previously , which began the existence of life on the planet as well . 

 The serial 's original storyline was devised by Fisher but was heavily re @-@ written by script editor Adams , aided by producer Williams . It was the first Doctor Who serial to film on location outside of the United Kingdom ; the production team worked in Paris during April and May 1979 . The studio work was completed in June . 

 Broadcast during a strike that took ITV ( the BBC 's rival ) off the air , City of Death scored high ratings . The fourth episode was watched by over sixteen million viewers , the highest UK television audience ever attained by an episode of Doctor Who . Although , in retrospect , it has been regarded as one of the best serials from Doctor Who 's classic run , the initial reception was not as positive , with criticism of the humorous tone . 


 = = Plot = = 


 While leisurely enjoying the city of Paris with Romana , the Doctor feels the effects of time distortion . At the Louvre while admiring the Mona Lisa , he encounters the Countess Scarlioni wearing an alien bracelet used to scan security systems . The Doctor and Romana meet Inspector Duggan , who has been tailing Count Scarlioni for some time ; Scarlioni has placed a large number of lost art treasures on the market , and Duggan fears the Scarlionis are looking to steal the Mona Lisa . Though the three are briefly captured by the Countess , the Doctor helps them to escape and explore the Count 's mansion , where they discover equipment by Dr. Kerensky to experiment with time , the source of the Doctor 's time distortions . They also discover , behind a wall , six exact copies of the Mona Lisa , each painted by Leonardo da Vinci himself . 

 Leaving Romana and Duggan to continue to investigate in the present , the Doctor uses his TARDIS to visit Leonardo 's workshop . There he is captured by Captain Tancredi , whose appearance is the same as Count Scarlioni . Tancredi reveals he is Scaroth , the last of the Jagaroth race , stranded on Earth and fragmented through time due to an explosion of their spacecraft on Earth 400 million years ago . Seeking to restore himself and his race , Scaroth has aided human technological advancement , while remaining in contact with the other fragments of himself . Tancredi , in this era , has convinced Leonardo to paint 6 copies of the Mona Lisa , so that when Scarlioni steals the known painting in 1979 , he can then sell it seven times , substantially funding the completion of Dr. Kerensky 's work . When Tancredi leaves the Doctor under watch by a human guard , the Doctor knocks out the guard , uses a felt @-@ tip marker to write " This is a fake " on the six blank canvases and leaves instructions for Leonardo to paint over the text , as to allow them to track the copies in the future by X @-@ raying them . The Doctor escapes when Tancredi suffers a temporary collapse caused by his other selves . 

 The Doctor returns to the present and learns that Scaroth has succeeded in stealing the Mona Lisa . Furthermore , Scaroth has killed Dr. Kerensky and threatens to do the same to the entire city of Paris if Romana does not complete Kerensky 's work . The Doctor convinces the Countess that her husband is not human , and she sees his true face , but the Count kills her before she can react . With the time equipment fixed , Scaroth uses it to travel back 400 million years in hopes to stop the explosion of his ship . Though Romana reveals that the equipment will bring him back after two minutes , the Doctor asserts that it is enough time for Scaroth to stop the explosion of the Jagaroth ship , itself the source of the spark of energy that created the beginnings of life on Earth ; should Scaroth prevent the explosion , every native living being on the planet will never have existed . The Doctor , Romana , and Duggan race to the TARDIS and travel back to intercept Scaroth . Duggan punches Scaroth unconscious before he can stop the ship . Scaroth 's body returns to the present as the ship attempts to take off and explodes , assuring the development of life on Earth . 

 In the present , Scaroth is killed by his henchman Hermann , who does not recognise him without his human mask , and a failure in the time equipment sets the mansion ablaze . By the time the Doctor , Romana , and Duggan arrive , the original and five of the six copies of the Mona Lisa have been destroyed , but one of the copies remains untouched . The Doctor proposes that since a copy of a painting by the original artist is not a fake , the painting should be considered the real work of art , reminding Duggan that art is worthless if its monetary value is all that matters . The Doctor and Romana say goodbye to Duggan at the Eiffel Tower .

 Writer David Fisher had contributed two scripts to Doctor Who 's sixteenth season – The Stones of Blood and The Androids of Tara – and was asked by producer Graham Williams for further story ideas . Fisher submitted two proposals ; the first of these became The Creature from the Pit while the other , The Gamble with Time , concerned a plot to rig the casinos in Las Vegas to finance time travel experiments . Williams asked Fisher to rework The Gamble With Time as a spoof of Bulldog Drummond , a fictional detective from the 1920s . Fisher 's draft script centered around Scarlioni , a member of the Sephiroth race , who had become fractured in time in an accident . The script was mainly set in the year 1928 with the Doctor and Romana , aided by Drummond @-@ esque detective " Pug " Farquharson , on the trail of the stolen Mona Lisa , pursuing Scarlioni from Paris to Monte Carlo where his partner , the Baroness Heidi , is using time travel technology to cheat at roulette at the casino to fund Scarlioni 's time travel experiments . Other settings included Paris in 1979 , Leonardo da Vinci 's studio in the year 1508 and prehistoric Earth . At this point , production unit manager John Nathan @-@ Turner had worked out that the production team could afford to film on location in Paris with a stripped @-@ down crew . This necessitated a rewrite to Fisher 's scripts to move the action to Paris and , for cost reasons , to drop the 1920s setting . The Doctor 's robotic dog companion K9 also had to be removed from the script as the cost of bringing the robot dog and his operators to Paris was prohibitive . 

 However , Fisher was going through a divorce , and his personal situation meant that he was unable to perform the rewrites . This meant that script editor Douglas Adams , aided by Graham Williams , had to perform a complete rewrite of the story over the course of a weekend . According to Adams , Graham Williams " took me back to his place , locked me in his study and hosed me down with whisky and black coffee for a few days , and there was the script " . The revised script , now titled The Curse of the Sephiroth , was credited to " David Agnew " , a standard pseudonym used by the BBC and which had been previously used on Doctor Who for the season fifteen serial The Invasion of Time . The serial was subsequently retitled City of Death on 8 May 1979 . Adams would later reuse elements of City of Death , along with the unfinished Doctor Who serial Shada ( 1979 ; 2003 ) , in his novel Dirk Gently 's Holistic Detective Agency ( 1987 ) . In Part One , Romana makes a throwaway reference to a great art gallery called the Braxiatel Collection ; the Virgin New Adventures novel series would later expand on this , introducing the character Irving Braxiatel , a Time Lord . Braxiatel also appears in the Bernice Summerfield series of novels and audio dramas and in the Gallifrey series of audio dramas . 


 = = = Casting = = = 


 Julian Glover was a well @-@ established character actor who had previously appeared in Doctor Who as Richard the Lionheart in The Crusade ( 1965 ) . Glover was reluctant to don the Jagaroth mask created for scenes where Scarlioni had shed his human disguise as he felt the mask would impede his performance . As a result , he is doubled by Richard Sheekey in many of these scenes . Tom Chadbon was cast as Duggan on account of his resemblance to the Franco @-@ Belgian comics hero Tintin . Peter Halliday had previously appeared in several Doctor Who serials including The Invasion and Doctor Who and the Silurians . 

 Douglas Adams knew John Cleese and Eleanor Bron through his connections with Monty Python and the Cambridge Footlights . On learning that both would be working in BBC Television Centre on the day the art gallery scenes were to be recorded , he persuaded them to make a cameo appearance in a short scene written for " two Englishmen " . Cleese and Bron agreed on the condition that there be no pre @-@ publicity regarding their appearance ; Cleese wanted them to be credited as " Helen Swanetsky " and " Kim Bread " but the BBC declined . Cleese liked the name " Kim Bread " and used it in later projects . During recording , Cleese and Baker also recorded two short comedy skits for the BBC Christmas tape . 


 = = = Filming = = = 


 City of Death director Michael Hayes had previously directed the Doctor Who serials The Androids of Tara ( 1978 ) and The Armageddon Factor ( 1979 ) . He also had experience filming in Paris , having worked there on adaptations of Maigret ( 1960 – 63 ) and other Georges Simenon stories for the BBC . Location filming took place in Paris between 30 April 1979 and 3 May 1979 . It proved a difficult shoot as the dates coincided with the May Day holiday period , which meant that many of the locations chosen for filming were closed , necessitating considerable improvisation on the part of the cast and crew . Model filming was conducted at Bray Studios between 8 May 1979 and 10 May 1979 . These concentrated on the shots of the Jagaroth spacecraft taking off from the prehistoric Earth and were overseen by Ian Scoones , a veteran of Gerry Anderson 's Thunderbirds . Following rehearsals , production moved to BBC Television Centre where the remaining scenes were recorded in two blocks ; the first between 21 May 1979 and 22 May 1979 and second between 3 June 1979 and 5 June 1979 . 

 Tom Baker found filming in Paris to be a very different experience to what he was used to in the UK where crowds would gather to watch the filming and meet the stars . Doctor Who was not shown in France at the time and so the cast and crew were largely ignored . Lalla Ward found City of Death the most challenging Doctor Who serial she worked on but was pleased with the final outcome , saying , " We had to film loads of scenes in the rain and cold ... there was no glamour in it at all ... it was different from the ordinary stories too and I like the finished result " . Seeing her costumes as an important part in creating the role of Romana , Ward clashed with costume designer Doreen James , rejecting the silver catsuit James had designed for her for the story . Ward came up with the idea for the schoolgirl costume she wore in conjunction with Baker , recalling , " I thought it would be fun to wear something that little girls probably hated wearing because it might cheer them up ... I didn 't bank on the fact that I 'd also get loads of letters from their fathers saying ' Cool School uniform ! ' " . 


 = = Broadcast and reception = = 


 City of Death was broadcast on BBC1 over four consecutive Saturdays beginning on 29 September 1979 . At this time , industrial action had blacked out rival broadcaster ITV and as a result , the serial scored very high ratings , averaging 14 @.@ 5 million viewers over the four episodes ; 16 @.@ 1 million watched the fourth episode , the largest audience ever recorded for an episode of Doctor Who . The story was repeated on BBC1 across four consecutive evenings from Tuesday to Friday , 12 - 15 August , 1980 , achieving viewing figures of 6 @.@ 3 , 5 @.@ 5 , 5 @.@ 6 and 5 @.@ 9 million viewers respectively . 

 Audience appreciation ratings were taken for the first two episodes of City of Death , and both episodes attained a respectable score of 64 % . Listings magazine Radio Times published two letters from viewers regarding City of Death . Les Rogers of Hastings praised the serial 's cast and the location filming ; less impressed , however , was Paul R. Maskew of Exeter who felt the show was being played for laughs . Responding to similar criticisms from viewers , Douglas Adams wrote , " If the programme didn 't move and take a few risks then it would have died of boredom years ago " . Several viewers wrote to point out the discrepancy between the start of life on Earth of 4 @,@ 000 million years ago and the date given in City of Death of 400 million years ago . Graham Williams replied , " The good Doctor makes the odd mistake or two but I think an error of 3 @,@ 600 million years is pushing it ! His next edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica will provide an erratum " . Another viewer wrote to point out that the atmosphere of the primordial Earth would have been poisonous to the Doctor and his companions ; Douglas Adams responded to this criticism , citing dramatic licence . 

 City of Death was voted into seventh place in a 1998 poll of the readers of Doctor Who Magazine to find the best Doctor Who story ; the magazine commented that it " represented the height of Doctor Who as popular light entertainment for all the family " . In 2009 , Doctor Who Magazine readers voted it in eighth place . In a more recent 2014 poll , the magazine 's readers voted it fifth best Doctor Who story of all time . A 2008 article in The Daily Telegraph named City of Death one of the ten greatest episodes of Doctor Who . John Condor , writing in the fanzine DWB in 1991 , hailed the story as " the best blend of kitsch , surrealism , fantasy and comedy @-@ drama seen in our favourite Time Lord 's annals " . Vanessa Bishop , reviewing the serial 's DVD release , described it as " imaginatively written , well @-@ performed and beautifully made , City of Death is a story where pretty much everything works " . Reacting to the serial , as part of Doctor Who Magazine 's ongoing " Time Team " feature , Jacqueline Rayner said " you 're suddenly , almost violently , made aware this is happening in our world ... with people just getting on with their business and two Time Lords walking through it . I don 't think I 've ever experienced that with Doctor Who up till now ... it 's the tiny touches of mundanity amid the fantastical that lift the story even higher " . Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo @-@ Marxuach of io9 included it on their list of " 10 TV Episodes that Changed Television " , citing " the sharp dialogue and clever use of time travel [ that ] prefigure everything Steven Moffat has done with the series in recent years . " The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn described City of Death as the " gem " of the seventeenth season , finding Adams ' subtle comedy script " easily the funniest and most quotable the series ever achieved " . While he praised Scarlioni 's costume and the mask , he felt that more could have been done with using Paris as a filming location . 

 However , Doctor Who fandom 's initial response to the serial was not so positive ; John Peel , writing in the fanzine TARDIS in 1979 , decried it as " total farce ... I simply couldn 't believe this was Doctor Who ... the continual buffoonery is getting on my nerves " . A similar view was held by Gary Russell who , reviewing the VHS release in 1991 , said , " City of Death , like most Douglas Adams material , is overrated and misses the mark for me , falling between the stools of good pastiche and bad parody and making fairly unsatisfactory viewing " . This line was countered by Vanessa Bishop who called it " the Doctor Who story it 's alright to laugh at ... we must now accept that City of Death is funny — because if we didn 't the Crackerjack @-@ style sleuths , scientists and all ... would leave it knocking about near the bottom of all the Doctor Who story ranking polls " and , responding to the criticisms about the levels of comedy , that " it 's precisely these things that make it seem so special " . Reviewing the serial in 2011 , Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times stated he disliked the smug tone to the humour and Ward 's " snooty " portrayal of Romana . Despite this , he noted that the serial had good production values and direction , as well as a few jokes that he enjoyed .

 City of Death is one of five Doctor Who serials from the series ' original run ( 1963 – 1989 ) not to have been novelised by Target Books ; the others are The Pirate Planet , Shada , Resurrection of the Daleks , and Revelation of the Daleks . Target approached Douglas Adams on a number of occasions with a view to commissioning a novelisation , offering their standard advance of £ 600 ; Adams replied saying , " I don 't want to be embarrassing but I do have a tendency to be a best @-@ selling author " . Target , concerned that their regular authors would seek better terms , refused to change their offer . Several years later , Target editor Nigel Robinson offered an advance of £ 4 @,@ 000 – double what was the standard advance at the time – but Adams again declined . Adams was unwilling to allow another author to write the novelisation . However , after Adams ' death his estate allowed Gareth Roberts to write an adaptation of the unfinished serial Shada , which was published by BBC Books in 2012 . In 2013 , Roberts announced that he was working on a novelisation of City of Death , to be published on 21 May 2015 . Roberts later announced that James Goss was working on the book instead .

 = Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution = 


 The Fourth Amendment ( Amendment IV ) to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and requires any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause . It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance , a type of general search warrant issued by the British government and a major source of tension in pre @-@ Revolutionary America . The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison , along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights , in response to Anti @-@ Federalist objections to the new Constitution . Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28 , 1789 . By December 15 , 1791 , the necessary three @-@ quarters of the states had ratified it . On March 1 , 1792 , Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment . 

 Because the Bill of Rights did not initially apply to the states , and federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century of the nation 's history , there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century . The amendment was held to apply to the states in Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) . 

 Under the Fourth Amendment , search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court , usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it . Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central questions : what government activities constitute " search " and " seizure " ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed . Early court decisions limited the amendment 's scope to a law enforcement officer 's physical intrusion onto private property , but with Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) , the Supreme Court held that its protections , such as the warrant requirement , extend to the privacy of individuals as well as physical locations . Law enforcement officers need a warrant for most search and seizure activities , but the Court has defined a series of exceptions for consent searches , motor vehicle searches , evidence in plain view , exigent circumstances , border searches , and other situations . 

 The exclusionary rule is one way the amendment is enforced . Established in Weeks v. United States ( 1914 ) , this rule holds that evidence obtained through a Fourth Amendment violation is generally inadmissible at criminal trials . Evidence discovered as a later result of an illegal search may also be inadmissible as " fruit of the poisonous tree , " unless it inevitably would have been discovered by legal means .

 The amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows : 

 The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .

 = = = English law = = = 


 Like many other areas of American law , the Fourth Amendment finds its roots in English legal doctrine . Sir Edward Coke , in Semayne 's case ( 1604 ) , famously stated : " The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress , as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose . " Semayne 's Case acknowledged that the King did not have unbridled authority to intrude on his subjects ' dwellings but recognized that government agents were permitted to conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained . 

 The 1760s saw a growth in the intensity of litigation against state officers , who , using general warrants , conducted raids in search of materials relating to John Wilkes 's publications attacking both government policies and the King himself . The most famous of these cases involved John Entick , whose home was forcibly entered by the King 's Messenger Nathan Carrington , along with others , pursuant to a warrant issued by George Montagu @-@ Dunk , 2nd Earl of Halifax authorizing them " to make strict and diligent search for ... the author , or one concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers entitled , ' The Monitor or British Freeholder , No 257 , 357 , 358 , 360 , 373 , 376 , 378 , and 380 , ' " and seized printed charts , pamphlets and other materials . Entick filed suit in Entick v Carrington , argued before the Court of King 's Bench in 1765 . Charles Pratt , 1st Earl Camden ruled that both the search and the seizure was unlawful , as the warrant authorized the seizure of all of Entick 's papers — not just the criminal ones — and as the warrant lacked probable cause to even justify the search . By holding that " [ O ] ur law holds the property of every man so sacred , that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour 's close without his leave " , Entick established the English precedent that the executive is limited in intruding on private property by common law . 


 = = = Colonial America = = = 


 Homes in Colonial America , on the other hand , did not enjoy the same sanctity as their British counterparts , because legislation had been explicitly written so as to enable enforcement of British revenue @-@ gathering policies on customs ; until 1750 , in fact , the only type of warrant defined in the handbooks for justices of the peace was the general warrant . During what scholar William Cuddihy called the " colonial epidemic of general searches " , the authorities possessed almost unlimited power to search for anything at any time , with very little oversight . 

 In 1756 , the colony of Massachusetts enacted legislation that barred the use of general warrants . This represented the first law in American history curtailing the use of seizure power . Its creation largely stemmed from the great public outcry over the Excise Act of 1754 , which gave tax collectors unlimited powers to interrogate colonists concerning their use of goods subject to customs . The act also permitted the use of a general warrant known as a writ of assistance , allowing tax collectors to search the homes of colonists and seize " prohibited and uncustomed " goods . A crisis erupted over the writs of assistance on December 27 , 1760 when the news of King George II 's death on October 23 arrived in Boston . All writs automatically expired six months after the death of the King and would have had to be re @-@ issued by George III , the new king , to remain valid . 

 In mid @-@ January 1761 , a group of over 50 merchants represented by James Otis petitioned the court to have hearings on the issue . During the five @-@ hour hearing on February 23 , 1761 , Otis vehemently denounced British colonial policies , including their sanction of general warrants and writs of assistance . However , the court ruled against Otis . Future US President John Adams , who was present in the courtroom when Otis spoke , viewed these events as " the spark in which originated the American Revolution . " 

 Because of the name he had made for himself in attacking the writs , Otis was elected to the Massachusetts colonial legislature and helped pass legislation requiring that special writs of assistance be " granted by any judge or justice of the peace upon information under oath by any officer of the customs " and barring all other writs . The governor overturned the legislation , finding it contrary to English law and parliamentary sovereignty . 

 Seeing the danger general warrants presented , the Virginia Declaration of Rights ( 1776 ) explicitly forbade the use of general warrants . This prohibition became a precedent for the Fourth Amendment : 

 That general warrants , whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed , or to seize any person or persons not named , or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence , are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted . 

 Article XIV of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights , written by John Adams and enacted in 1780 as part of the Massachusetts Constitution , added the requirement that all searches must be " reasonable " and served as another basis for the language of the Fourth Amendment : 

 Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches , and seizures of his person , his houses , his papers , and all his possessions . All warrants , therefore , are contrary to this right , if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation ; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer , to make search in suspected places , or to arrest one or more suspected persons , or to seize their property , be not accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search , arrest , or seizure : and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases , and with the formalities , prescribed by the laws . 

 By 1784 , eight state constitutions contained a provision against general warrants . 


 = = Proposal and ratification = = 


 After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation , a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17 , 1787 , featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes . George Mason , a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia 's Declaration of Rights , proposed that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included . Other delegates — including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison — disagreed , arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other , unnamed rights were unprotected . After a brief debate , Mason 's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations . 

 For the constitution to be ratified , however , nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions . Opposition to ratification ( " Anti @-@ Federalism " ) was partly based on the Constitution 's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties . Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification ( including Virginia , Massachusetts , and New York ) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights . Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches . 

 In the 1st United States Congress , following the state legislatures ' request , James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689 , including an amendment requiring probable cause for government searches . Congress reduced Madison 's proposed twenty amendments to twelve , and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25 , 1789 . 

 By the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for ratification , opinions had shifted in both parties . Many Federalists , who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights , now supported the Bill as a means of silencing the Anti @-@ Federalists ' most effective criticism . Many Anti @-@ Federalists , in contrast , now opposed it , realizing that the Bill 's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention , which they desired . Anti @-@ Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution , such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation , intact . 

 On November 20 , 1789 , New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve amendments , including the Fourth . On December 19 , 1789 , December 22 , 1789 , and January 19 , 1790 , respectively , Maryland , North Carolina , and South Carolina ratified all twelve amendments . On January 25 and 28 , 1790 , respectively , New Hampshire and Delaware ratified eleven of the Bill 's twelve amendments , including the Fourth . This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten , but the process stalled in other states : Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify , while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments , but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so . ( All three states would later ratify the Bill of Rights for sesquicentennial celebrations in 1939 . ) 

 In February through June of 1790 , New York , Pennsylvania , and Rhode Island each ratified eleven of the amendments , including the Fourth . Virginia initially postponed its debate , but after Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791 , the total number of states needed for ratification rose to eleven . Vermont ratified on November 3 , 1791 , approving all twelve amendments , and Virginia finally followed on December 15 , 1791 . Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1 , 1792 . 


 = = Applicability = = 


 The Bill of Rights originally only restricted the federal government , and went through a long initial phase of " judicial dormancy " ; in the words of historian Gordon S. Wood , " After ratification , most Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the Constitution . " Federal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was narrow until the late 19th century when the Interstate Commerce Act and Sherman Antitrust Act were passed . As federal criminal jurisdiction expanded to include other areas such as narcotics , more questions about the Fourth Amendment came to the Supreme Court . The U.S. Supreme Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose of the amendment as guaranteeing " the privacy , dignity and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government , without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function . " In Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . 

 Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central issues : what government activities constitute " search " and " seizure " ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed . 

 The Fourth Amendment typically requires " a neutral and detached authority interposed between the police and the public , " and it is offended by " general warrants " and laws that allows searches to be conducted " indiscriminately and without regard to their connection with [ a ] crime under investigation . " , for the " basic purpose of the Fourth Amendment , which is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth , through its prohibition of " unreasonable " searches and seizures is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials . " 

 The Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that a search or an arrest generally requires a judicially sanctioned warrant , because the basic rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and " searches conducted outside the judicial process , without prior approval by judge or magistrate , are per se unreasonable . " In order for such a warrant to be considered reasonable , it must be supported by probable cause and be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a person ( usually a law enforcement officer ) who has sworn by it and is therefore accountable to the issuing court . The Supreme Court further held in Chandler v. Miller ( 1997 ) : " To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment , a search ordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing . But particularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes warranted based on ' special needs , beyond the normal need for law enforcement . ' ... When such ' special needs ' are alleged , courts must undertake a context @-@ specific inquiry , examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties . " The amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures , but not those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on behalf of a government . In Ontario v. Quon ( 2010 ) , the Court held the amendment to also apply to the government when acting as an employer , ruling that a government could search a police officer 's text messages that were sent over that government 's pager . 


 = = = Search = = = 


 One threshold question in the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether a " search " has occurred . Initial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on a citizen 's property rights — that is , when the government physically intrudes on " persons , houses , papers , or effects " for the purpose of obtaining information , a " search " within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment has occurred . Early 20th @-@ century Court decisions , such as Olmstead v. United States ( 1928 ) , held that Fourth Amendment rights applied in cases of physical intrusion , but not to other forms of police surveillance ( e.g. , wiretaps ) . In Silverman v. United States ( 1961 ) , the Court stated of the amendment that " at the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion . " 

 Fourth Amendment protections expanded significantly with Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) . In Katz , the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual 's right to privacy , and ruled that a search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached to the outside of the glass . While there was no physical intrusion into the booth , the Court reasoned that : 1 ) Katz , by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him , had exhibited his expectation that " the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world " ; and 2 ) society believes that his expectation was reasonable . Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that " the Fourth Amendment protects people , not places " . A " search " occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person 's " reasonable expectation of privacy . " Katz 's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government 's intrusion , though electronic rather than physical , was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment , and thus necessitated a warrant . The Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment , and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed . 

 This decision in Katz was later developed into the now commonly used two @-@ prong test , adopted in Smith v. Maryland ( 1979 ) , for determining whether the Fourth Amendment is applicable in a given circumstance : 

 a person " has exhibited an actual ( subjective ) expectation of privacy " ; and 

 society is prepared to recognize that this expectation is ( objectively ) reasonable . 

 The Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to information that is voluntarily given to third parties . In Smith , the Court held individuals have no " legitimate expectation of privacy " regarding the telephone numbers they dial because they knowingly give that information to telephone companies when they dial a number . 

 Following Katz , the vast majority of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy , but in United States v. Jones ( 2012 ) , the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law , but rather , has supplemented it . In Jones , law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car 's exterior without Jones ' knowledge or consent . The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to the car , and so had a property interest in the car . Therefore , since the intrusion on the vehicle — a common law trespass — was for the purpose of obtaining information , the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment . The Court used similar " trespass " reasoning in Florida v. Jardines ( 2013 ) , to rule that bringing a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search . 

 In certain situations , law enforcement may perform a search when they have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity , even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest . Under Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) , law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances . In Terry , the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses " unusual conduct " that leads that officer to reasonably believe " that criminal activity may be afoot " , that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others , the officer may conduct a " pat @-@ down search " ( or " frisk " ) to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon . This detention and search is known as a Terry stop . To conduct a frisk , officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which , taken together with rational inferences from those facts , reasonably warrant their actions . As established in Florida v. Royer ( 1983 ) , such a search must be temporary , and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop ( e.g. , officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car , cannot , after confirming that it is not stolen , compel the person to answer questions about anything else , such as the possession of contraband ) . 


 = = = Seizure = = = 


 The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizure of any person , person 's home ( including its curtilage ) or personal property without a warrant . A seizure of property occurs when there is " some meaningful interference with an individual 's possessory interests in that property " , such as when police officers take personal property away from an owner to use as evidence , or when they participate in an eviction . The amendment also protects against unreasonable seizure of persons , including a brief detention . 

 A seizure does not occur just because the government questions an individual in a public place . The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution . The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained . The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable , objective grounds , with few exceptions . His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds . 

 In United States v. Mendenhall ( 1980 ) , the Court held that a person is seized only when , by means of physical force or show of authority , his freedom of movement is restrained and , in the circumstances surrounding the incident , a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave . In Florida v. Bostick ( 1991 ) , the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required , the police contact is a " citizen encounter " that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment . If a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government , there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person 's privacy under the Fourth Amendment . 

 When a person is arrested and taken into police custody , he has been seized ( i.e. , a reasonable person who is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car would not think they were free to leave ) . A person subjected to a routine traffic stop on the other hand , has been seized , but is not " arrested " because traffic stops are a relatively brief encounter and are more analogous to a Terry stop than to a formal arrest . If a person is not under suspicion of illegal behavior , a law enforcement official is not allowed to place an individual under arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity , provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the case . A search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment , so long as the arresting officer has probable cause . In Maryland v. King ( 2013 ) , the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for DNA upon arrests for serious crimes , along the same reasoning that allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest and detain . 


 = = = = Exceptions = = = = 


 The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion , with a few exceptions . In Delaware v. Prouse ( 1979 ) , the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver 's license and the registration of the automobile , unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered , or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law . 

 Where society 's need is great , no other effective means of meeting the need is available , and intrusion on people 's privacy is minimal , certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists . In United States v. Martinez @-@ Fuerte ( 1976 ) , the Supreme Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints . In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz ( 1990 ) , the Supreme Court allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints . In Illinois v. Lidster ( 2004 ) , the Supreme Court allowed focused informational checkpoints . However , in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond ( 2000 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general crime @-@ fighting checkpoints are not allowed . 


 = = = Warrant = = = 


 Under the Fourth Amendment , law enforcement must receive written permission from a court of law , or otherwise qualified magistrate , to lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal activity . A court grants permission by issuing a writ known as a warrant . A search or seizure is generally unreasonable and unconstitutional if conducted without a valid warrant and the police must obtain a warrant whenever practicable . Searches and seizures without a warrant are not considered unreasonable if one of the specifically established and well @-@ delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement applies . These exceptions apply " [ o ] nly in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs , beyond the normal need for law enforcement , make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable . " 

 In these situations where the warrant requirement doesn 't apply a search or seizure nonetheless must be justified by some individualized suspicion of wrongdoing . However , the U.S. Supreme Court carved out an exception to the requirement of individualized suspicion . It ruled that , " In limited circumstances , where the privacy interests implicated by the search are minimal and where an important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion " a search [ or seizure ] would still be reasonable . 


 = = = Probable cause = = = 


 The standards of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search . The government has a probable cause to make an arrest when " the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information " would lead a prudent person to believe that the arrested person had committed or was committing a crime . Probable cause to arrest must exist before the arrest is made . Evidence obtained after the arrest may not apply retroactively to justify the arrest . 

 When police conduct a search , the amendment requires that the warrant establish probable cause to believe that the search will uncover criminal activity or contraband . They must have legally sufficient reasons to believe a search is necessary . In Carroll v. United States ( 1925 ) , the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible , common @-@ sense standard . To that end , the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States ( 1925 ) that the term probable cause means " less than evidence that would justify condemnation " , reiterating Carroll 's assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to the officer would " warrant a man of reasonable caution " in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime . It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false . A " practical , non @-@ technical " probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required . In Illinois v. Gates ( 1983 ) , the Court ruled that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the " totality of the circumstances . " 


 = = Exceptions to the warrant requirement = = 



 = = = Consent = = = 


 If a party gives consent to a search , a warrant is not required . There are exceptions and complications to the rule , including the scope of the consent given , whether the consent is voluntarily given , and whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another 's property . In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte ( 1973 ) , the Court ruled that a consent search is still valid even if the police do not inform a suspect of his right to refuse the search . This contrasts with Fifth Amendment rights , which cannot be relinquished without an explicit Miranda warning from police . 

 The Court stated in United States v. Matlock ( 1974 ) that a third party co @-@ occupant could give consent for a search without violating a suspect 's Fourth Amendment rights . Per the Court 's ruling in Illinois v. Rodriguez ( 1990 ) , a consent search is still considered valid if police accept in good faith the consent of an " apparent authority " , even if that party is later discovered to not have authority over the property in question . 


 = = = Plain view and open fields = = = 


 According to the plain view doctrine as defined in Coolidge v. New Hampshire ( 1971 ) , if an officer is lawfully present , he may seize objects that are in " plain view " . However , the officer must have had probable cause to believe that the objects are contraband . 

 Similarly , " open fields " such as pastures , open water , and woods may be searched without a warrant , on the ground that conduct occurring therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy . The doctrine was first articulated by the Court in Hester v. United States ( 1924 ) , which stated that " the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to the people in their ' persons , houses , papers , and effects , ' is not extended to the open fields . " 

 In Oliver v. United States ( 1984 ) , the police ignored a " no trespassing " sign and a fence , trespassed onto the suspect 's land without a warrant , followed a path for hundreds of feet , and discovered a field of marijuana . The Supreme Court ruled that no search had taken place , because there was no privacy expectation regarding an open field : 

 open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance . There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities , such as the cultivation of crops , that occur in open fields . 

 While open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment , the curtilage , or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home , is protected . Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person 's home ( unlike a person 's open fields ) under the Fourth Amendment . The curtilag
