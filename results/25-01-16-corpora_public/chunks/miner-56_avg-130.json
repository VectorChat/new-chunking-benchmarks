For example, we might choose AQ (16) + JJ (6) which gives us exactly 22 combos.

Frances then explicitly introduces a figurative comparison between her pain and \u201cswords on fire,\u201d and goes on to use metaphorical expressions that are to do with at least two kinds of causes of physical damage: sharp metal objects cutting the flesh (\u201cripping out,\u201d \u201crod,\u201d \u201ca million swords\u201d), and heat (\u201chot,\u201d \u201con fire\u201d).", "chapter_name": "openwebtext-10k_9"}, {"text": " The hotness of the metaphorical swords is also conveyed metonymically by references to colour (\u201cred\u201d), while the description of the swords includes movement up and down Frances's back and legs (\u201cmove down relentlessly,\u201d \u201clike an escalator\u201d).", "chapter_name": "openwebtext-10k_9"}, {"text": " In other words, while all the various figurative expressions can be subsumed under the \u201cCAUSES OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE\u201d source domain, there is creativity in the choice of at least some of the specific expressions that are used (e.g., \u201cswords,\u201d \u201cripping out\u201d), and in the establishment of a tight textual pattern that involves the combination of different kinds of causes of physical damage (application of sharp objects, movement of sharp objects, and heat), resulting in a rich metaphorical scenario.
